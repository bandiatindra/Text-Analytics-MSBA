0,"September  7, 2018  4:01PM",dino001,"If they keep it around in next four-five years, I think I will make myself to put on a hazmat suit and visit our friendly Kia dealer (oh, boy are they horrible here, or what) to check it out. It's got a lot of good stuff, but seems like they are still behind on a few things, such as relationship between power and gas mileage (e.g. BMW 340/440 has similar performance, but much better gas mileage as a daily driver), but with appropriate price difference, those objections and shortcomings are not insurmountable. Biggest thing will be the ""first contact"" with a sales person. Hope it won't start from ""are you buying it today?"", ""what can I do to make you take it home?"", or ""let me wash your BMW - oh, I can't find the keys"", ""How about I show you the deal - square one, two, three, four""."
1,"September  7, 2018  9:43PM",circlew,"The lease rate is the factor that stops me cold from taking the leap.  Since I don't track my cars, it would do fine for my needs but I would assume an M2 would surpass the Stinger on the track compared to the Giulia."

Yes, the completely noncomparable M2 would beat the Stinger on track, as would a corvette or sportbike, BTW."
3,"September  9, 2018  3:51AM",FlightNurse2, Why not a Genesis G70 with a manual?
4,"September  9, 2018  1:01PM",roadburner,"Again, the local dealer are hopeless at best(What can I do to put ya in a car today, pal?)- and with the well know Hyundai proclivity to void warranties at the drop of a hat I could see problems with using it as my instructor car."
5,"September  9, 2018  3:19PM",FlightNurse2," Are you talking about Genesis Dealers or Hyundia dealers? If you go out to the Genesis web site, I think you will see a completely different type of experience. Just like Infiniti, Lexus and Acura changed the way people looked at Asian cars, Genesis dealers aren't Hyundia dealers. Granted there are no Genesis only dealerships yet, but when Rich and I went and looked at a Genesis G80, the treatment was miles a head of what you get at the Kia or Hyundia salespeople. No pressure they weren't looking to be your best friend. Just have to wait for the G70 to show up at the dealers."
6,"September  9, 2018  4:49PM",roadburner,"Thanks, but I am more than aware of the distinction. The dealer group that owns the future Genesis store(and the current Hyundai store) has less than a stellar reputation. I suspect that their Genesis sales ""experience"" would still require me to take a long hot shower afterwards. Not worth my time."
7,"September  9, 2018  5:38PM",dino001," Yeah, I went once to an AutoNation Lexus store. It had nice decor and everything, but the experience wasn’t the same as my local BMW dealer. It was polite, but you could still feel primary focus on sale and closing, not the product exposition and its potential fit into your life, which I felt at BMW, Audi, or even Volvo stores, every time I visited those. Something you expect at a good Toyota dealership. The difference is subtle, but perceptable. It’s mostly in the types of conversations you have with the salesman, or the manager, if he/she introduces themselves. After the visit I even received generic template follow up emails from two different managers, even though I made it clear to the sales guy the product was not interesting to me (I was looking at CT200h and it was a total dog, real disappointment). To their credit, when I responded to them saying don’t call/write and explained why, they left me alone."
8,"September 24, 2018  1:19PM",benjaminhf,"I am the poster formerly known as benjaminh and now as benjaminhf. Just wanted to say I'm still alive, but my 17 year history with Edmunds has seemingly been erased. Also I've been very busy with work. But I wanted to briefly say that I'm still really enjoying the driving experience with my leased 2018 Acura TLX 2.4 Tech. Great car for the money imho. All best wishes out there to the chronic car buyers, etc. @stickguy: are you still considering a TLX?"
9,"September 24, 2018  1:51PM",stickguy,Still on the list. Just have not been looking actively right now.
10,"September 24, 2018  2:51PM",kyfdx, I sent you a message
11,"September 26, 2018 12:40PM",benjaminhf,"A new and mostly positive review by Kelly Blue Book of the TLX. The reviewer says the TLX is likely to be more reliable than some other luxury cars in the long run, which is good news for me since I'm hoping to keep mine for quite a while...."
12,"September 26, 2018 12:53PM",stickguy,"If I do manage to upgrade to a TLX it would have to be with a 10 year horizon.  That was the deal the wife made to get the RDX. that just had its 6th anniversary last week, and sitting at about 48,000 miles. Though getting used more now. Wife just started a new job Monday, with a 27 mile RT commute. Going to wear the poor thing out. Another reason for me to upgrade. Get something she can share for commuting duty."
13,"September 26, 2018 12:59PM",benjaminhf, Thanks. I'll give it a try at some point to merge my accounts.
14,"September 26, 2018  1:03PM",benjaminhf," I'm not sure if I'd have the patience and discipline to really keep a car for ten years—maybe eight?—but if I did this TLX would be the car for that. So far I really like the TLX on all levels—driving dynamics, comfort, awesome sound system, looks. It's by far the best car I've ever had. And given that it's an Acura I can see potentially driving it past the standard 70,000 mile engine and transmission warranty.  Not surprisingly it seems like the incentives on the 2019s are less than what was available over the summer for the 2018s. Maybe even by Thanksgiving the lease incentives might be higher again?"
15,"September 26, 2018  1:22PM",stickguy,"They usually go up as the year goes along. Christmas ind Presidents’ Day are good options.  I try and stagger the cars, so always at least one newer. Also helps to only have one loan at a time, max."
16,"September 26, 2018  1:36PM",benjaminhf,"Yeah, I was and am a bit concerned with getting two new cars at once. But so far we haven't regretted it. The CR-V is also an awesome vehicle. We love it for what it can do in terms of large cargo space while still carrying passengers. We use that a lot, actually. And the CR-V is also fun to drive. Anyway, we put an extra 4k down on our the 15k loan we have for the CR-V, and so now the amount owed on it is down to 11k. If we can make another 4k extra in Dec., which might be possible, and then yet another 4k extra early next summer, that along with our monthly payments might get us free and clear on the CR-V by July or so. Then we'll just have the reasonable $229 a month lease on the TLX."
17,"September 26, 2018  1:47PM",benjaminhf,"The KBB reviewer makes some good points about the infotainment system on the TLX. As he says, it's not intuitive at first, but over time it becomes pretty good. And I'm now used to it and can use it pretty easily. My wife's new CR-V has just the touchscreen, and in some ways I prefer that, but believe it or not in other ways I prefer the TLX's 2-screen system. Let me try to briefly explain. So with the one touchscreen like with the CR-V—and many new vehicles these days—you are either in one display mode or another for the screen. In other words, if you've called up the stereo controls on the screen, then the map you might be using from AndroidAuto or CarPlay goes away. Same with the climate controls on the CR-V. With the system on the TLX, however, you can have two things going on at the same time. And so your navi screen at the top (which is a good place for it, right below the line of sight outward) can be doing its thing directing you to where you need to go, while the lower screen on the TLX is displaying your stereo and climate controls. Plus the touch screens, to state the obvious, are magnets for dust and fingerprints, and since you don't touch the upper screen on the TLX it stays pristine. Finally, the TLX's touch screen is more responsive than the one on the CR-V. Sometimes you need to press an electronic ""button"" on the CR-V's screen twice to activate it, while one gentle touch on the TLX's screen almost always works the first time.  In terms of handling, even my wife has said she really likes the way the TLX drives. She likes the 4-wheel steering (although it took her a couple of months to actually feel it), the handling, and the smooth power."
18,"September 26, 2018  2:09PM",stickguy,"I like the 2 screen set up, for just the reason you said. More real estate, and dedicated map when needed."
19,"September 26, 2018 10:37PM",benjaminhf,"My local Cadillac dealer has their last ATS available for lease for $200 a month with ""0 down"":  ""2018 CADILLAC ATS Sedan 2.0t STD Lease For$199/MO $0 DOWN""  https://www.courtesycadillac.net/MonthlySpecials  Quite the deal for that car imho."
20,"September 26, 2018 10:45PM",stickguy,I would take it. without even looking at the link!
21,"September 26, 2018 11:25PM",roadburner,That dealer has the same GM as my BMW dealer- the guy that ran off all but two of the BMW salespeople and added dealer packs and a high doc fee.
22,"September 27, 2018 12:09AM",qbrozen,"The fine lrint for all says ""plus dealer add-ons."" Oh boy. But, all else being equal, I'd probably take the XT5 for $30 more. "
23,"September 27, 2018 12:17AM",carnaught,"The CTS looks like a smokin’n deal if your name is not @graphicguy. So is the XT5, although I understand it’s a slug."
24,"September 27, 2018 12:46AM",stickguy,"so the car is $199/month, and the mop and glow stuff is another $175?"
25,"September 27, 2018  2:19AM",roadburner, If I was 25 years older I might an XT5 as well.
26,"September 27, 2018  2:22AM",qbrozen,"carnaught said: The CTS looks like a smokin’n deal if your name is not @graphicguy. So is the XT5, although I understand it’s a slug. Its a hard knock life when 0-60 in 6.5 secs in an SUV is called ""a slug."""
27,"September 27, 2018  9:30AM",circlew,"Well, the translation for ""slug"" could be this:"
28,"September 27, 2018 10:26AM",qbrozen,Wait... an SUV doesn't handle like a sedan?! Good thing we have reporters to bust scandals like this wide open! ;b
29,"September 27, 2018  1:31PM",ab348,"I wouldn't call the XT5 I had as a loaner a slug by any means, but I didn't like it much. Felt big, heavy, and it had that awful BMW-style beer-tap gearshift which I hated."
30,"August  7, 2018 11:51PM",benjaminh,"One of the features I like on my TLX's stereo is that it has built-in memory/storage for CDs. The new Accord and many other cars have taken out the CD player entirely, but the TLX with ELS sound has a player that downloads every CD into its memory in about 5 minutes and then stores it in an album folder. In the first pic you'll see that it's at 29% for downloading the 1958 classic album from Nat King Cole called St. Louis Blues...."
31,"August  8, 2018 12:00AM",andres3,"      What's the storage capacity in GB? If uncompressed WAV files, about 700 MB per album."
32,"August  8, 2018 12:08AM",benjaminh," Good questions. Tried to look it up at the Acura web site but the info doesn't seem to be there. Perhaps its in the owner's manual....  In any case the ELS sound system is better than my home stereo. I'm hearing details on albums I haven't heard before. I've been thinning out my CD collection over the last ten years, but thank goodness I still saved c. 150 favorites! I'm planning to start downloading them to the car each week as I drive."
33,"August  8, 2018  1:53AM",sda," That's cool as I still play CDs in the Accord and Pilot from time to time. I still listen to vinyl about once a month at home. Some cassettes, rarely, thou no 8 tracks."
34,"August  8, 2018  2:08AM",henryn,"Back in the late 80's or early 90's (don't remember what year) I donated two high end turntables and slightly over 400 vinyl record albums, and never looked back. I spent years protecting and cleaning and fussing over records like each one was the hope diamond. No more, never again, thank you very much. And then when I got divorced in 1999, I donated some uncounted number of CDs. All ripped and stored on the computer, no need for optical disks anymore. In those days, if I was going on a trip, I would burn custom CDs, a ""road mix"" if you will, just for that trip. These days, it's all on flash drives with a playlist. Some things do get better.  And I will extend that to cars. Yes, cars really are a lot better. Faster, cleaner, MUCH longer lasting. If I don't enjoy them as much (although I still do enjoy, just not as much), then I attribute that to being a grouchy old man.  You kids get off my lawn!"
35,"August  8, 2018  2:16AM",roadburner,The hard drives in late model BMWs have a 20GB storage capacity- it is convenient.
36,"August  8, 2018  4:43AM",Michaell," May I suggest you check out a copy of the book ""The Revenge of Analog"" from your local library?  Goes into detail about the revival of things like vinyl, books, board games, notebooks and the like. Great read."
37,"August  8, 2018  3:42PM",Mr_Shiftright,  Funny...I just had this image of feeding vinyl records into the dashboard.
38,"August  8, 2018  4:34PM",Michaell," Oh, you mean like this?"
39,"August  8, 2018  6:23PM",Mr_Shiftright,Yeah but the BIG ones.
40,"August  8, 2018  6:37PM",Michaell, You asked for it …
41,"August  8, 2018  7:34PM",Mr_Shiftright,"Oh, it even has a stacker. This new technology will change everything."
42,"August  8, 2018  7:38PM",ab348,"A new name, Shifty?"
43,"August  8, 2018  7:53PM",Mr_Shiftright," A minor glitch we are working on . But it's still me  Ah, fixed!"
44,"August 10, 2018  6:12PM",laurasdada,"I believe my XF has a 10gb hard drive, it allows me to upload 10 CDs. So 10 on the HD, one in the player = the Spinal Tap nirvana of 11."
45,"August 11, 2018 10:53PM",benjaminh,Another little feature I like on the TLX is the built-in compass....
46,"August 12, 2018 12:47AM",sandman_6472,Was watching the Mecum auction at Harrisburg the other night and they had a DeSoto Firedom go through the line with that same record player. Outstanding looking vehicle!!  The Sandman
47,"August 12, 2018 12:44PM",sda,"     I like the location and look of the compass and assume that the nav is linked to that display as the street name is shown. Does it show speed limit, too? The large, clear easy to read gauges are a big plus."
48,"August 12, 2018  1:44PM",benjaminh," Yes, the AndroidAuto navigation is linked to that little top display. There's actually a dial on the right of the steering wheel that lets you scroll through your various choices for that display, including tire pressure, oil life, compass/navi, performance mode, etc. When on compass/navi and you've asked it to go somewhere it also displays an arrow to show the direction of your next turn along with a mileage marker for how long that will be. All of that is also displayed in much bigger form on the center screen with the map, but it's a nice little addition to keep you on track to your destination.  PS Now that I've driven both the TLX and my wife's CR-V a lot, I've decided I like non-turbo engines slightly better. The 1.5T on the CR-V does have maybe a third of a second delay in acceleration when you floor it—but in certain situations that can seem like a substantial delay. And so turbo lag has been reduced with these new engines, but not completely eliminated.  PPS My guess is that the next generation TLX, due in maybe a year or so, will go turbo and take out the 4-wheel steering. I'd rather have a naturally aspirated engine and the 4WS. Right now I am hoping to finance the residual on the TLX when the lease is up, if we can afford it at that time. It's a really nice car that I'd like to keep long-term."
49,"August 13, 2018  4:00PM",andres3,"  Floor it in a Audi with DSG on sport mode, and see if you still think turbo lag is a problem.  My guess is that the delay is more due to programming and transmission ineptitude than on the turbo lag. Does the CVT make an appearance in the CRV?"
50,"August 13, 2018  4:13PM",stickguy,"CRV is now a CVT, yes."
51,"August 13, 2018  5:51PM",andres3," Bingo, there's the problem, and I haven't even test driven the 1.5T yet."
52,"August 13, 2018  6:23PM",benjaminh, Yeah. I think the CVT combined with a little bit of turbo lag results in a so-so performance for acceleration when you first start out.
53,"August 13, 2018  6:47PM",stickguy,"Plus it’s not a lightweight, and us pushing an AWD system."
54,"August 14, 2018 12:06AM",andres3,@benjaminh  Alltrack pictures:
55,"August 26, 2018  5:59PM",flightnurse,"So what is up with Edmunds these days? logging is a pain..  On a side note, took a little trip to San Diego, my 330i averaged 35 MPG with an average speed of 85. At 85 my car is at 2000RPMs I'm still amazed on how the MPG of this car."
56,"September  6, 2018  9:54PM",henryn,https://cars.com/articles/kia-stinger-gt-vs-alfa-romeo-giulia-ti-who-does-luxury-and-lap-times-best-1420702781441/?aff=emailac&emc=emailac&smtrctid=779136862  Interesting read. Especially considering two of our regulars here in the forums have just purchased Alfa Romeos.  Who's going to step up and buy a Stinger? (smile)
57,"September  7, 2018 10:38AM",circlew,Thinking about it....  https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/kia-stinger-gt-reliability-long-term-update
58,"September  7, 2018  1:27PM",qbrozen," Stinger interests me, but not the horrible lease rates."
59,"September  7, 2018  3:38PM",roadburner," The Stinger is too big for my tastes, and the transmission overheat issue would also nix it if I wanted to use it as a dual purpose car. For strictly street use I still prefer the Giulia Ti Sport, even though it's a bit on the slow side. I still think my next car will be either an M2 or an M2C."
60,"July 27, 2018 10:12PM",benjaminh,  So your c. 10 year old Mini is worn out—and you're thinking of trading it in for a c. 20 year old Saab? You seem to be searching for exquisite automotive pain on multiple levels. Maybe a new base Mini with a manual might be something to consider? A car with new suspension parts and a warranty? Just a thought. I'm just a tad concerned that you're not able to enjoy driving as much as you should. But I realize it's none of my beeswax. Apologies....
61,"July 27, 2018 10:18PM",benjaminh," A 4-cylinder is really enough power for me. I didn't test drive the V-6 because I knew that wasn't in the cards—and not really suited for my budget and driving style. This particular 2018 TLX Tech 2.4 4WS had more than $6k of lease incentives. I did have a trade-in, but my monthly lease payment including taxes and everything else is $229 for a car that has an msrp of $37,600. That's the right level for our budget, esp. since my wife's payment on her 3-year car loan is $450—and we have a daughter starting college in a year.  But the 4-wheel steering on the TLX is enjoyable. I worry now that I won't want a car without this feature in the future. But given that Acuras with good maintenance and some luck tend to last a long time, this is a car that may—knock on wood—be with me for a while."
62,"July 27, 2018 10:22PM",andres3,"  So I think you answered my question, the SH-AWD is only available with the V6. The incentives were not as good on the V6's I take it?"
63,"July 27, 2018 10:25PM",benjaminh," Yes, the super-handling awd is only available with the V-6. MSRP is significantly higher on those models, and the lease incentives weren't quite as high."
64,"July 27, 2018 10:48PM",benjaminh,"On those winding roads I was driving to a park that's popular with cyclists, and by chance I ended up parking my Acura TLX near a c. 2010 TL. This park is a private-public partnership and the infrastructure is excellent. Different grade levels and separate bridges for bikes and cars, rest areas for hikers and bikers, etc. One of the true treasures of the Louisville area. The bike ride up the big hill was tiring but good for this 53 year old. The bike ride down was grin-inspiring.  https://www.theparklands.org/the-vision.html"
65,"July 29, 2018  3:56PM",Mr_Shiftright," I've always been a high-risk buyer, not in terms of buying cars that are broken, but in terms of buying cars with a dubious reputation---often those are the most fun (for me). I think the Saab would actually be newer. The Mini is a 2003 and most of it is original, except for all the parts that literally fell off it.  Actually what the Mini really needs is sticky tires and RWD."
66,"July 29, 2018  6:17PM",benjaminh,"Highway mpg continues to surprise on the upside with the TLX 2.4. Some manual calculations seem to indicate that it usually inflates the mpg by about .3 mpg or so. And so 39.5 would really probably be closer to 39.2. Both of these trips were c.90% highway with speeds ranging from c. 55-75 with the ac on. Somewhat hilly ride at times. Was making a tour of the historic downtown of Corydon, Indiana, where there is a little shop that specializes in old signs."
67,"July 29, 2018  6:38PM",sda,"Great mpg, and wonderful that you like the TLX so much. Enjoy the pics, too. Need to drive the CR-V some, give observations about it, and keep your mileage down on the TLX. But your wife might thump you on the head for taking her ride, lol."
68,"July 30, 2018  5:53AM",benjaminh," The CR-V is a very nice vehicle—but not really my cup of tea. It really is my wife's car. But you're right that I'm going to need to start driving it to reduce the added miles on the TLX. The CR-V feels rather big and tall compared to the TLX, or really almost anything else I've ever driven except my 1969 VW Bus from so long ago. Are you thinking of a CR-V? A CR-V really has good bang for the buck, with impressive passenger and cargo room."
69,"July 30, 2018  5:57PM",jpp5862, How many miles do you have on the TLX now? After going on a couple of test rides with @michaell I'm a fan of the 4 cylinder TLX.
70,"July 30, 2018  6:11PM",benjaminh," I already have over 2500 miles on it—and I've only owned it a month. For initial purchase price and mpg I think the 2.4 is a winner. And kept in Sport mode it's fast enough for me, but no doubt the V-6 is much faster."
71,"July 30, 2018  7:12PM",jpp5862,  That says a lot that you've driven it that much. The V6 may be a bit faster but I prefer the 4 cyl.
72,"July 31, 2018 12:43AM",sda," I will buy another sedan at some point. Thinking a current version of the Accord EXL/Touring, TLX tech, Audi A4, used CPO. I am interested to know how the 1.5 engine performs. A friend just bought an '18 CR-V EXL AWD and says it doesn't feel as peppy as their '15 CR-V AWD which they still have. She also says the '18 feels bigger than the '15. My SIL is going to replace her '06 TL soon and says she will give it to us for my daughter to drive. It is still in excellent condition and she is the original owner. As nice as that might be, that puts a kink in my plan to give the Accord to my daughter and for me to get something 'new' for me. My wife is doing a happy dance, no new purchases! ugh"
73,"July 31, 2018 11:01AM",benjaminh," Your daughter getting an Acura TL from a relative seems like it might be a good thing when it comes to getting a future car for you—because instead of giving your 2013 Accord EX to your daughter you can use your substantial trade-in value to get a new car for yourself. Mr.Shiftright has suggested on another thread that Audis after 80k miles tend not to be reliable, which might make an Acura or Honda better for long-term ownership. If you need a bigger back seat the Accord is going to be a better choice than the TLX, but in most other ways I think the TLX is better than an Accord. At some point you might consider test driving both."
74,"August  1, 2018  2:49PM",henryn,"  If you need a big back seat in a sedan, you really need to look at the Passat."
75,"August  1, 2018  9:11PM",sda,"I haven't ruled out the Passat. I find it attractive and from what I understand they drive well but not as crisply as the '06 Passat 2.0T that I used to own. As much as I like VWs, have owned many, none have been as trouble free as the Hondas we've owned."
76,"August  2, 2018  3:37AM",andres3," I have an old friend that just testified to the following:  He took his '86 Accord to 337,000 miles, at which point it ran well, but got rear-ended and totaled.  He currently has a '04 Accord at 184K miles, His plan is to save up for the following 5 years, and then buy his race/sports car.  This came up because he lives very close to where my old S4 is for sale right now."
77,"August  2, 2018 10:52AM",benjaminh," The 2018 Passat got a mixed review from Motor Trend recently. They didn't much like the engine, the braking, the handling, etc. The Passat has a roomy back seat, and can be had at a bargain price, but....  https://www.motortrend.com/cars/volkswagen/passat/2018/2018-volkswagen-passat-first-test-review/"
78,"August  2, 2018 11:44AM",ab348," Well, it sounds like the author had consumed quite a bit of the Honda Kool-Aid, so I would take the article with a grain of salt. It certainly looks better than the Accord or Camry, and I suspect the handling and braking criticisms may be due to the selection of hard low rolling-resistance tires by VW. One thing I fail to undertand is how VW can take a 2L engine, turbocharge it, and end up with 174HP when other makes routinely get around 80-100HP more by doing that."
79,"August  2, 2018 11:58AM",benjaminh," The entry-level TLX with an msrp of $33k might also be something to consider. For 3k more than an Accord EXL it offers some significant things above an Accord in terms of the steering, transmission, brakes, interior design and quality, etc. Although I've gotten somewhat used to the style of the new 2018 Accord, I still think the TLX looks better from every angle.  The A4 is also a very nice design, and the Audi is maybe the best-looking entry-level luxury car right now imho. The TLX is close, but I do think that the Acura calipers on the front grill are maybe a bit too large, like it's trying a little too hard? I'm getting used to it, but I think the styling details on the Audi are very nice.  I guess the real bargain for leasing when it comes to entry-level luxury cars is the ILX, which is basically the fanciest and most powerful 2015 Civic ever. Still, with a lease price of c. $200 a month it's a good deal for the money. It's close to the same price as leasing a Civic.  Your 2013 Accord EX might be worth c. $11-12k at trade-in, which obviously means that you have a big downpayment. Would you lean toward leasing or buying?  For entry-level luxury cars the lease deals seem better than the purchase deals."

84,"August  4, 2018 10:57PM",benjaminh,"""Danger Will Robinson!""  What happens when you like driving your new car too much? In just five weeks of ownership I've put c.3300 miles on it on my newly leased TLX Tech. I love the handling, the stereo, the engine, the transmission, the seats, etc. And so I've been going on lots of fun trips to see old friends, driven to sites in town I haven't seen, and I've also been driving to cities I've never before visited. Since I'm a prof. (which perhaps explains a few things) once the school year starts in a couple of weeks I won't be driving so much since I'll be working all the time. So that should slow down the miles, and then I'll also probably start driving my wife's new CR-V sometimes when going back and forth to Lexington.  But yikes...."
85,"August  4, 2018 11:53PM",benjaminh,"With destination the starting price for an Acura TLX is $33,995. That's a lot of money, but for that price the TLX comes with a moonroof, power heated seats, AcuraWatch, etc., etc. An Audi A4, BMW 320i, or Lexus ES350 with about the same level of equipment all have msrps of about $41k, making the 34k for the TLX seem pretty good. But some people put the A4, 320i, and ES350 in a higher category than the TLX.  For the entry-level model TLX probably some are cross-shopping the Accord EXL 1.5, which has an msrp with destination of about $31k. So one way to look at it would be what does the TLX base have that makes it worth $3000 more than an Accord EXL.  Here's my very subjective valuation of what the added features and qualities of the TLX are worth to me personally over an Accord EXL....  The exclusive 4-wheel steering of the TLX would be worth to me as an option at least $1200. The 4WS really helps make the steering better, from parallel parking, to medium speed cornering, to higher speed lane changes. Great system imho.  The 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter is worth at least $800 to me compared to the Accord's CVT.  The better suspension of the TLX compared to the Accord is worth at least $500 to me.  The quieter ride of the TLX is also worth about $500 to me.  The TLX's better and bigger brakes with their ""Premium Bosch 6-piston brake modulator"" another 500. Plus the ten spoke wheels look better to me on the TLX than the strange designs found on the Accord.  The longer Acura warranty—4 year bumper to bumper, and 6 year/70,000 mile engine and transmission is also worth maybe 500 to me. And the fact that they threw in 2 years of maintenance in a much nicer waiting area reinforces that.  The nicer interior parts all throughout the inside the TLX, and the more interesting and better-looking to me sheetmetal outside is worth at least another 1000, and maybe twice that.  Very subjectively to me then the TLX does seem to be ""worth"" c. 5000+ more than a comparable Accord, making the added cost of 3k seem like a good deal. And with the lease incentives Acura offers it doesn't seem like you even pay that....?"
86,"August  5, 2018 12:46AM",sda," What classes do you teach? I wonder if the standard audio in the TLX is better than the current Accord EXL+ models. I do wish the standard TLX came with leather instead of faux leather. The higher seating position in the TLX, similar to my Accord is a plus. I don't like the lower seating stance of the new Accord."
87,"August  5, 2018  1:38AM",benjaminh," I teach art history—and I really enjoy it!  I think the standard audio in the TLX is similar to the top-of-the-line system in the Accord EXL/Touring. So it's a very good system that's quite a bit better than what you and I hear/heard in our EXs. The ELS takes it to the next level, but the starting system is already equal to the best that Honda offers—and maybe it's even a little bit better? In terms of the leatherette, I would have been happy with that too. In fact, imho it's less worry because leatherette will last longer than probably almost anything else on the car, while leather after 8 years or so might be reaching the danger zone even if cared for.  The seating position in the TLX is just slightly lower than in my 2016 Accord.  But like you I did find the seating position of the 2018 Accord maybe a little too low.  I do enjoy the Tech features, but if they had had a TLX base on the lot I might have gotten that one if it saved me money over the Tech. It happened that it was the very last TLX 2.4 they had."
88,"August  5, 2018  1:17PM",sda," I have always enjoyed history and am sure I would enjoy your class. When I went to The Univ of TN, Knoxville, I took several French culture classes that were a mix of history and reading books written by French authors. One class was taught by a professor who had participated in the French resistance during WWII. The stories and insight that she shared, wow. I am delighted you enjoy what you do, too many don't.  To stay on topic: I see more and more TLXs on the road. For first generation it is hard to tell the 2.4 from the V6, with the rim style/tire size being the real give away. Goodyear tires on the 2.4, Bridgestone tires on the V6."

The vehicle was a relative base (cloth seats, no Nav), but the overall level of equipment, fit and finish was quite good. Despite being FWD, it was nicely responsive, but I have to admit, the ""spritited"" handling was last thing on my mind there, as I was more focused on not hitting anything and constantly fighting my cross-wired senses (left is right, right is left). Nevertheless, it would have been quite good substitute if you didn't want to shell out as much money. Of course I didn't like that diesel's characteristics as much as my gas engine, but it wasn't a tractor, as say my late dad's 2005 A4 TDI."

This time my gas station calculation was almost the same as the car's trip computer, which said I'd gotten 34.1 mpg over the same 401 miles. This was for about 80% highway.

Anyway, while I get ready for yet another c. 160 mile round trip from Louisville to Lexington with the new TLX, here are a few more random pix.

That's an inappropriate tire for an A-spec model.  Changing out the tire to something like a Michelin Pilot Super Sport 4S would probably make the car twice as fun in the canyons, literally.

The Kia (RWD) is withing a 10th and 1 MPH of the Alfa in the quarter. Impressive. Less impressive is both cars having serious failure issues so early, and not surviving the test regimen.

But I do like acceleration.  When I'm coming up the freeway on ramp, spot a hole in the traffic, punch it, and the car lunges forward, I mean really jumps -- yeah, I like that. Yes, I will pay extra for that.  But the difference in 1/4 mile times between the Kia and the Alfa -- not going to matter in my world. Both of them will jump just fine, more than enough for me.  A few years back, when I was seriously considering a used Genesis, I did several test drives. Both 6 cylinder models and V8's. The guy who wrote the review for Edmunds said you didn't need the V8, it would only be for bragging rights. A conclusion which I vehemently disagreed with.  I alternate two daily drivers, a Town and Country and an F150 with an Ecoboost. The Town and County is fast enough, it will get out of it's own way. But you have to punch it, wait for the downshift, wait for the engine to spool up, and THEN it will move pretty good. The Ecoboost, lightly touch the throttle and you are moving!"

This is is beginning to seem like slightly higher mpg than for my 2016 Accord with the CVT—a car that weighs c.200 lbs less. Puzzled by this. Could it be the 8-speed dual clutch transmission? Is a DCT sometimes more efficient than a CVT?  My 2016 Accord CVT was rated 36 on the highway—and that's about what I got. Sometimes I got a 1-2 mpg more, sometimes 1-2 mpg less, and sometimes right on.  The 2018 Acura TLX 8-DCT is rated 33 on the highway—and yet I seem to be getting 36-39 mpg on the highway. I regularly seem to be getting 3-5 mpg higher than the EPA rating, which has never happened for me before in decades of checking my mpg on my cars. And this is in the hot summer with the AC on. During the Fall months, when I won't be using the AC much, seems like I'll probably do even better?  Overall, I like my new TLX a lot. Really a lot. In almost every way it's better than my 2016 Accord—which itself was the best car I'd ever owned up until I got the TLX. Cars, unlike some things in life, really can get better than in the old days.  The suspension is one of the things that impresses me about the TLX. It's controlled and yet comfortable, seemingly getting a nearly perfect mix of sporty and luxurious, but with a slight emphasis on the former.  And the ELS stereo is excellent. I'm ashamed to say that I think of reasons just to drive my car so that I can listen to the stereo and enjoy the ride...."

146,"July 20, 2018  3:29AM",andres3," I would say for sure a DCT is more efficient than a lowly CVT, but a DCT with a torque converter sounds less efficient, but it seems Acura found a good middle ground. There's a reason many people won't consider a car with a CVT, even if Honda does it better than just about anyone."

About a 20 minute drive each way, 60-70 mph on the highway, and then some two lane roads. Got about 35 mpg on the little trip with ac on the whole way, which seemed pretty good. We have good parks here in Louisville, and some have very nice bike paths. In fact, I think the ""Louisville Loop"" in its various places is one of the better urban/rural bike paths in the country. Anyway, here's one of my uses of my entry-level luxury sedan for today—and in the last pic you can see my ugly mug to see the face of the guy who has been bothering you off and on for almost 20 years here. By the way, the volume dial on the steering wheel of the TLX has been copied for the 2018 Accord.

I got c.36 mpg on the way over and c.38 mpg on the way back. This is a c.80 mile drive with AC on going c.70-75 mph.

I drove 225 miles with 6.4 gallons, which gives an average of 35.15 mpg for c. 85% highway driving—which is quite good. The only problem is that my trip computer said that I got 36.2 mpg for those 225 miles. Hmmm. I thought the trip computer's mpg numbers, which were seemingly slightly better than my Accord's, were maybe a little too good to be true. But the real number is still better than I expected, esp. given that the EPA highway rating on the TLX 2.4 is 33.  My son the engineer/computer coder said that my method of manually checking the mpg could have a margin of error as well. Who is to say that the shut of works exactly the same each time, or that you have the filler in the same amount? I guess he has a point? In any case, I'll try to remember to test it again manually on the next tank and see what I get.  Bottom line is that I'm still happy with the mpg of the TLX 2.4. On the highway seems just as good as an Accord 2.4."

The handling is something else too, as it has far more capability in that department than I am used to using.  The seats are OK. The lumbar support is adjustable (via an inflatable bladder) and the side bolsters also can move in and out. Truthfully I don't notice much difference regardless. There is also an adjustable thigh support (the front part of the cushion is separate and can move in and out) but again I notice little difference. Maybe a smaller person would appreciate these things more than I do. I am probably not the best judge of seats. To me the most comfortable seats of any car I ever had were in my '09 Lacrosse, which were the standard 8-way power adjustable leather thrones. They were cushy and soft with very pliable leather so you sunk into them and with the adjustment set correctly they were just about perfect. I remember being disappointed when I traded it on the 2011 Regal and had lived with it for a while at how hard those seats were and how stiff the leather seemed in comparison."

The funny thing is there are a lot of cars that can keep up on the Angeles Crest Highway (ACH). You don't have to spend $200K on a Porsche to keep up. A lot of people in LA do put a few mods on their cars though.  Canyon carving, like any task, requires having the right tool for the job.

One highway run of c.70 mph with AC had a car calculated 36.5 mpg. If that's not a fluke, and if the car's mpg calculator is accurate (the one on my Accord was) then the highway mpg is very close to what I got in the 2016 Accord. Still finding all sorts of little quality touches, such as the nice feeling carpet, and the hidden storage area in the trunk (no spare tire, just fix a flat). I'd rather have a tire, I think, but the honest truth is that I haven't changed a tire since about 1995. Since then I've always let AAA do it, or tow it, and I haven't had any regrets."
190,"July 12, 2018  8:28PM",henryn,"      It has been several years since I last used a spare tire. And then, bang, last Saturday, blow out on my minivan. I hit something out on the freeway, never saw what it was. My wife (now ex) used AAA and other ""road service"" (USAA insurance) several times, and the average wait was 1 to 2 hours.  It took me about 15 minutes to get back on the road Saturday, and I thought that was rather long actually. Unfamiliarity with the mid-mounted spare, I actually had to dig out the owner's manual. IT guys really hate to RTFM.  Fix a flat doesn't cut it, in my opinion. This incident Saturday, there was a hole in the sidewall. I don't think any amount of ""goop"" would have done the trick.

191,"July 12, 2018  8:45PM",stickguy,"Henry, I am with you. No spare tire is a hot button issue. Last blow out I had was at night, on a holiday, in the middle of nowhere. At least with the donut on I could get to a hotel, then next day find a tire store. The tire was shredded so yeah, no can of fix a flat was helping.  I believe the TLX (at least prior to 2018 redesign) had a spare as an option. The ILX definitely did. Heck, if you pulled out the tray insert, the bracket with the screw hole to attach the tire bold was already there. And at one point they listed it as an accessory option on the build it page.  the new RDX at least still has a spare. I would have to check a TLX to see if the tire well is still there."

AAA response time in my area is usually about 15 minutes, although no doubt that varies. I changed maybe 4 tires between 1980 and 1995, and each time found it a challenging and annoying job. I don't really want to do it again. Because of good luck, good maintenance, and good tires, somehow I don't recall that we've had a flat in the last 7 or 8 years in either my wife's car or my car. My wife's new CR-V has a full-size spare, which is something I haven't seen in a long time. Interesting that our two new cars in their own ways go to extremes on this. @stickguy it's not clear to me if a spare would even fit in the TLX. Maybe those plastic trays can be removed? Not sure. Honestly it doesn't look like it. They seem well built and built-in.  Anyway, you get a pressure sensor on each tire on the TLX.

Anyway, a few more pix of the new TLX, and a few little observations....The rear windows go completely into rear doors, and that didn't even quite happen with my Accord. Seems to be c. 5 LEDs in the side mirror turn signals compared to I think one with an Accord, trunk hinges are covered and protected, etc. The interior plastic wood or plood actually seems to be something like fake marble, which my son instantly named ""plarble"" lol!

200,"July 13, 2018  1:24AM",benjaminh," Yes, the TLX is quieter than our 2013 and 2016 Accords. This is esp. noticeable over slightly rougher pavement where we got a fair amount of tire/road noise in the Accords. This is muted with the TLX. Starting in 2018 Honda has started using some of the noise reduction engineering adapted from the TLX for the Accord. My guess is that there will probably still be a difference with the TLX even compared to the new generation of Accord, but not as much.  And tonight, I'll confess, I took another pleasure cruise in the TLX—although first I had to go to the gas station to get my first fill-up of premium. And yes, they told me at the Acura dealer that using regular won't hurt your engine, but honestly why would you sacrifice c. 20 horsepower with a car that's designed to use every horse it has. My feeling is that if you aren't going to put premium in a premium car when it's recommended that maybe you should get something else?  Anyway, the lower mpg of 22 was my c. 3 miles of stop and go traffic to the Costco gas station for my premium fill up.  And don't get excited about that upper mpg of 40. I think it's valid (although I need to check with this tank how accurate the mpg meter is), but this was a highway run of about 20 miles with light traffic going an almost steady c. 60-62 mph, although with the AC on fairly high and the car in Sport mode. This was on a series of 55 mph freeways around Louisville. So it's seemingly good mpg, but the reality is I'm usually going more like c.72 mph on 70 mph freeways back and forth between Louisville and Lexington. But if it's accurate, 40 mpg is about as high as I would have gotten in my Accord for this run.    @sda : You might check out a TLX, esp. if you can find one of the last of the 2018s. For a last generation Accord owner imho the TLX Tech a big upgrade, really a wow. I'm still getting lots of smiles from the four wheel steering.

The break down lane was small, and the dropoff was pretty steep. That F250 was very big, and very heavy, and it came with a tiny bottle jack. I wasn’t really sure it was going to lift the truck, but it did. Precarious is a word that comes to mind for that huge truck perched in the air on that tiny bottle jack.  I got the lug nuts off, but the aluminum wheel had welded itself to the hub. I looked around, found a big chunk of concrete, and used that to try and break the wheel loose. I’m laying under the truck, whacking the back side of the wheel with the concrete chunk, and an 18 wheel tractor trailer comes whizzing by at 80 mph. Sliding by my parked, jacked up truck by about 18 inches, maybe less. So naturally the truck sways back and forth on that tiny bottle jack and I’m thinking, “What a way to die. Crushed under a damned truck trying to fix a flat tire.”  There was another occasion. Not dangerous, but embarrassing. I was pulling the 5th wheel and had a blow out. If you’ve ever owned a travel trailer, then you will already know that they tend to eat tires. I looked around for a good place to get off the road, and spotted some kind of business with a big empty parking lot and pulled in. I’m jacking up the travel trailer (I always carried a really good jack with that thing), and my wife comes around and says, “You realize this is a funeral home, right?”  I look around, and she’s right, it’s a funeral home. I tell her it doesn’t matter, no one is there. Except … They obviously had a service of some kind scheduled, and the parking lot starts filling up. I swear it didn’t take me more than 10 minutes to swap out that tire, but in that 10 minutes the parking lot went from empty to full. And every single person who came in was looking at me like I was transgressing against their dead relative.  Some days …"
206,"July 13, 2018  3:40AM",benjaminh," Yeah, stuff like this is why I'm never going to bother with changing a tire ever again."
207,"July 13, 2018  3:43AM",stickguy,I would prefer not to either. The AAA guy can do that. Just have to have the tire on hand to put on!
208,"July 13, 2018  4:07AM",benjaminh," I'll just live on the wild side when it comes to spare tires (or lack) and see what happens. No doubt I'll let you know and cry uncle if somehow disaster strikes. But my guess is that the odds of a flat are low on the roads I drive. My second guess is that if I get one the fix-a-flat might work to get me to the gas station. My third guess is that even if a AAA tow truck has to take me to the gas station I'll be ok with it, since I've done that before a few times and it's not a big deal imho. Other things being equal I'd take a spare, but given how much I like almost everything else about the TLX I doubt I'll miss it much. Again, we'll see. I might end up eating my words...."

As a point of comparison my Mazdaspeed 3 needed several repairs under warranty and I eventually needed to replace most of the suspension components, but like my BMWs, the pleasure the car gave me outweighed those issues.

I've got a buddy over here in Alamogordo that swears by RWD cars. He says they're safer in the ice and snow than FWD cars and, basically, does not shut up about the issue. We just laugh at him and kid him about it - he also criticizes our driving (the other guy's driving, because I pretty much agree with him about this) as far as lane change procedures, putting on our turn signals correctly, etc. He's a stickler for driving accuracy, and, in those matters, I agree with him. I hate it when I'm turning right, for instance, and somebody behind me turns right, but goes around me right into the left lane without turning first into the right lane. I agree with him, that's not how the driver's guide teaches a person when they're first learning how to drive. And how they first teach you goes for lifetime driving.  But he's got an old Cadillac Catera RWD that he fixes or has repaired often. Loves it so much.

224,"July 10, 2018  1:58PM",benjaminh,"The resale values/residuals for most luxury performance sedans are weak compared to something like a Honda Accord. As you all know, that sometimes makes getting a used one a good deal. Sometimes it seems like for just a thousand or two more than an Accord with the same years and mileage you can pick up a 320i, an A4, or a TLX. Even new it seems like the lease incentives on some luxury sedans are so high they they are almost giving you for free the added quality, features, and performance of the luxury car.  I've mentioned before that maybe the most interesting book on the auto industry I ever read is called ""Car: A Drama of the American Workplace"" by Mary Walton, published in 1999. This book was not about a luxury car, but instead about the second generation Taurus, which Ford was trying to push higher in the marketplace. Anyway, one of the memorable things about it for me was that—not surprisingly—every single part on a car goes through a tough process of figuring out what the cost and therefore quality of the part can be. Ford was trying to make the 1996 Taurus a car that people would buy without big rebates, and as it was first designed and for its first year they allowed a higher budget for the cost of various parts so they would feel nicer, and sometimes function better. When the 2nd gen Taurus flopped in the marketplace the project manager had to huddle with his designers and engineers and try to figure out in an almost brutal way how to take something like $1500 in costs out of the car, which involved getting cheaper parts here, there, and everywhere.  Since I read that I've been even more aware than I was before of the quality of big and small things in a car. Sitting in a rental Hyundai Sonata, for instance, I could almost immediately tell that most parts did not get quite as good a budget/engineering detail as the Honda Accords I used to own.  And now with my new TLX, I can tell that the amount spent on most parts is not surprisingly higher than for a Honda. For instance, the steering wheel buttons and controls have a quality and size on the TLX that a Honda just doesn't have. This is partially about aesthetics, but it also impacts function. The adaptive cruise controls etc. are easier and more intuitive to use in the Acura when compared with my wife's new CR-V with its small and comparatively cheap butttons.  Again, given the discounts and incentives that most luxury performance sedans need to move, it's almost like the customer is getting this added quality for very little cost—and in some cases almost for ""free."""
225,"July 10, 2018  3:55PM",andres3,"    I think you hit the nail on the head. The gadgets and whiz bang bells and whistles keep increasing, but the underlying quality seems to be going the other way; especially in the better ""lower-end"" makes.

252,"July  6, 2018  4:08PM",benjaminh," Huge difference. Wish I'd done it before. Although it might be that the great deal I got was only available at this time for the significantly improved 2018 TLX. The 2017 TLX iirc lacked AcuraWatch and lacked AndroidAuto, both essential features imho.  On the TLX 2.4 the 0-60 acceleration, to be blunt, seems about the same as an Accord to me—although how you get there is different. At first acceleration seems faster in the TLX in 1st and 2nd, but then as it quickly goes toward 4th, 5th and beyond, it just loses punch. This is all in ""Normal"" mode. I think I might try Sport for a while and see what that's like. The TLX's 2.4 engine, of course, is a slightly souped up version of the Accord's engine that's made to take advantage of premium gas.  But aside from the engine almost everything else is a big upgrade over an Accord. For the most part, you can't even tell that there's any relation between the two cars. The steering with PAWS is sharper and better, the transmission with the 8-speed dual clutch is also a very different experience from a CVT, the leather seats feel as comfortable and supportive as those of the new BMW I was just in yesterday, the suspension has that planted feeling almost like you are riding on rails (but it's still really comfortable), etc. And the the sound system is beyond anything Honda offers, and maybe even better than what's offered in a comparable BMW or Lexus."

282,"June 20, 2018  1:45PM",kyfdx,"The Kia is fast and relatively large.. If you value size in a vehicle, that's great. But, I'd take the Alfa over it, in that price range."

284,"June 20, 2018  1:50PM",carnaught,"  I agree, with qualification. The Alfa would be a lease only."
285,"June 20, 2018  1:51PM",kyfdx,"I wouldn't buy a Stinger, for the same reason as the Alfa. The real depreciation might be a killer.  I don't think Kia is famous for reliability/repair, either."
286,"June 20, 2018  2:01PM",roadburner,"As I said, a RWD GT2 may well be a screaming bargain after the massive depreciation hit."

Compare that with the A5/S5/RS5, which sold a total of 2,169 in April and 8,243 for the year."""
289,"June 20, 2018  3:58PM",dino001,"This article is describing exactly what I think will be largest problems for Stingers and any other model over 40 grand. It's not even about the technology, as luxury dealers are sometimes behind on that, too (they were last ones to have their inventory posted online), but the attitude of ""you must buy it today"" that simply doesn't work for people who know they can afford a car twice as expensive, if they wanted to. All I need is to see the commercials of Kia dealers from my area and I know I don't want to go there. If they keep the Stinger around I still may need to bite the bullet and go to check it out for my next car. I get cold sweat even thinking about it."
290,"June 20, 2018 10:47PM",flightnurse,"Kia had a ""Stinger Experience"" here in Phoenix 2 months back and Rick and I went. It was very interesting they had 3 Kia Stinger GT RWD and 3 with AWD. They also had a BMW 640i GC, Audi A5, Porsche Panamera and another car I can't remember. You drive the ""other"" car first around a road course, then you pick a GT to drive, there are three laps, the last lap was driven by one of the ""Professional"" drivers. I got the Audi A5 and it was a dog, Rick got the 640 and loved it.  The GT has power, and it handles well, but I think we all know that Kia's do not hold value, I would wait for one to come off lease and be able to pick up a GT2 for about 23-25K."

303,"February  4, 2018  6:55PM",qbrozen,"I also, as I have stated before, think the Stinger is closer to the 5-series. No idea why Kia says anything about the 3'er, unless it is only because that is the standard all the mags use."
304,"February  4, 2018  7:04PM",flightnurse, Why do you think it needs to go against a 5 series? Size? I think Kia wants the 3 series because of the price.
305,"February  4, 2018  7:47PM",qbrozen,"Not sure where we made the comparison before, but yes, because of its size. Comparing on price does not make sense to me. You can get an Escalade and 911 for the same price, so does that mean they are comparable?"
306,"February  4, 2018  8:25PM",stickguy,"the comparison tests have all been versus the 3, A5, etc. even if the WB is a little longer, it doesn't really compete against the cars in the E/5 series class. Seems like it has always been that way though.  I was thinking it should compare to the 3GT. I assume they still make that one? The car mags (C&D) used the hatches (4 series and A5 sportback)"
307,"February  4, 2018  8:29PM",flightnurse,"They still make the 3GT, the issue really is, the 3GT only comes in xDrive while the Stinger can be had in RWD and AWD. Which I don't think is a proper comparison."
308,"February  4, 2018  8:35PM",stickguy,"well, in the north east, the 3 series effectively only comes as Xdrive. You will never find a RWD on the lot. I am guessing that Kia will likely be the same."
309,"February  4, 2018  9:33PM",qbrozen,"Here is what I posted on the previous page. In terms of interior room, especially rear seat space, the 5 and the Stinger are a virtual tie.

Interestingly, the 3'er has more front leg room than the 5'er. Stinger trumps both. Rear leg room is within a tenth of an inch between the 5'er and Stinger.

318,"February  5, 2018  4:50PM",andres3," so doing the math, your saying about 1% make it a decision issue?  While probably accurate, I'd argue the percentage where it does matter is higher. Weight (less of it) assists in better handling, ride, acceleration, fuel economy, and braking. Lighter cars simply feel more toss-able. Those seeking sporty handling will notice it, even if they don't look at spec sheets."
319,"February  5, 2018  4:52PM",andres3," Tires and brake pads will complain about weight by making you run out of them sooner and faster. The tires on my lighter TTS are holding up well, though I am planning to get new PS4's soon."

Rick and I stopped and looked a Stinger, it was a GT-1 V6 RWD, MSRP 46K, with all the features and options on this car a BMW 4 series 440i GC would be in the low 60's. It was very roomy in the rear seat, but getting in and out was a PIA. We didn't drive it, but for a 14K difference, I'm not too sure if paying the difference is worth it. The fit and finish was first rate, the salesman needed more training or he got his Audi models confused, he kept saying the Stinger competed against the A8.  Stopped by the Volvo dealer, and was shocked a V90 (wagon) on the lot, according to the salesman, someone ordered it and decided to take a V60 instead. Not too sure why the interior of that V90 was stunning. 55K fully loaded. What a deal, an MB E400 wagon starts at 59K. Volvo has a hit, not too sure why the V90 wagon (not to get confused by the Cross Country) is special order only car."
325,"February  7, 2018  7:10PM",coldinohio,"based on my brief drive of the Stinger GT2, Kia will have to up its game to play with the Audi /BMW / MB crowd; and having a $3500 regional markup is a non-starter  but the V6 is pretty nice"
326,"February  7, 2018  7:41PM",Michaell,"Soooo .... here's a thought.  From what I've read, it doesn't look like Kia will be able to convert the BMW/Audi/MB/Infiniti clientele to give the Stinger a second look, much less a first one.  But, for folks who haven't driven those brands on a regular basis (like me), would we be impressed enough with the drive / feel / interior materials enough to consider it?  Not that I'm in the market for a $30-50K vehicle like this, but just wondering ...."
327,"February  7, 2018  7:43PM",kyfdx,"The lease penetration is pretty high at those price points. And, the Stinger lease program sucks.  So, I'll guess it will sell about as well as the Cadenza."

My only concern with my current four turbo is its long term durability. Its first iteration was introduced in 2012 models, so the jury is still out on true long-term numbers. Mid-term seems OK, as there are no massive failures at 100k+ threshold being reported so far. We had a very long track record with the N/A straight six. Those four cylinders are still building the record. One positive, it seems the owners, dealers and garages got the memo regarding proper oil grades this time, unlike in 80s, when turbos were used first time the stakeholders had no idea how to properly maintain those engines. Cheap mineral oil was the king back then, it would sometimes kill the scroller bearings in 60k miles from coking, even if changed at 3k miles, as the oil particles were just too large for fast scrollers."

What list of options or standard equipment makes it an Entry Level? If you added leather to my car the MSRP would have been close to 49K. Just because it has BMW badge makes it ELLPS?"
362,"January 19, 2018  5:03PM",Mr_Shiftright,"It's a marketing term, it's not something quantifiable."
363,"January 19, 2018  5:31PM",andres3, Volvo? Aren't they kind of like Buick? (snicker snicker).  How about the Genesis and Cadenza or K900 or whatever other name the Koreans come up with?
364,"January 19, 2018  5:31PM",flightnurse, I fully get it so why can't other brands be brought into conversations?
365,"January 19, 2018  5:33PM",andres3," Spartan can mean different things to different people.  Especially if you've had a feature in a car for more than a Decade, going back to something that doesn't have it will seem ""outdated.""  Of course, I'd imagine even the most stripped model today would seem ""loaded"" compared to anything from 20 years ago, for those that only buy a new car every 20 years"
366,"January 19, 2018  5:44PM",kyfdx," Luxury.. We decided it meant a luxury brand.  Kia: Not a luxury brand Genesis: Not until you show me separate Genesis dealerships, that aren't adjacent to Hyundai dealerships. Until then, just a Hyundai.  Feel free to discuss the actual vehicles."
367,"January 19, 2018  6:20PM",Mr_Shiftright," Well it's a consensus kind of thing. One has to set a limit somewhere--or as the old saying goes:  ""If everyone is beautiful, then no one is beautiful""."
368,"January 19, 2018  9:40PM",Michaell,"  Yeah, then we could cover the entire automotive spectrum with just one thread here at Edmunds.  ""Talk about your transportation device - sedan, coupe, wagon, SUV, CUV, truck - whatever""  (and, I'm sure I missed a few categories as well)  I get it, however - one person's definitive list means that another person's choice would be excluded.  ""Near ELLPS""? ""Pseudo ELLPS""?  A year or so back, I created a thread to discuss the new compact SUV's (Trax, HR-V, etc.). Crickets.  Shifty's got one on electric vehicles - besides the two of us, I think there has been maybe one or two other unique posters who have contributed."
369,"January 20, 2018 12:33PM",circlew,"Then there is the 'near ellps' 2018 Kia Stinger. Nice car but no brand image as far as luxury goes.  It does look refreshing compared to some current ELLPS sedans, however."
370,"January 20, 2018  1:56PM",stickguy,"yup. Sometimes you get the car without the badge. and sometimes you get the badge, without the car! Up to each buyer to decide what is more important to them. The drive or the prestige (posing)"
371,"January 20, 2018  2:38PM",dino001,"I have to honestly say, I don't care how something is called, whether it's the ""right brand"", or it ""belongs"" to some category. To me important issues are if the vehicle drives right, has right amounts of features, sufficient reliability record of the model or brand and dealerships that don't treat you like an illiterate. It just so happens that those tastes and financial abilities coincide with number of models that are called ELLPS by many.  However, if Kia, Chevrolet, or Toyota came with a vehicle that has the features, handling and styling, I would consider it, regardless if somebody else calls it ELLPS, or not. It just so happens that up to this point their current lineup is aimed at different buyer demographics, but they could change. For example, Kia came up with Stinger, which looks quite ""tasty"" in the first glance. Even with their legendary obnoxious dealerships (at least here in Tampa Bay) with even more annoying commercials, if I were on the market, I would probably hold my nose and at least take a look and ask for a drive. If it checked all the right boxes, I'd take it. Lower price would be just a bonus. And I don't care if Edmunds' panel of discussion board experts considers that vehicle ELLPS, or not."
372,"January 20, 2018  2:46PM",stickguy,"the stinger really does seem like the acid test here. Car looks to have everything required to be a playa' if (and around here too, a big if!) they can overcome the dealer experience.  Hyundai, I have multiple dealers nearby that are perfectly fine. Just as good as any Honda dealer. So the upcoming small Genesis, IMO, should not have the same stigma to overcome, if they car is as good as it seems it might be."
373,"January 20, 2018  3:24PM",flightnurse,"Dino do tell about your 430 GC!!  When it comes to Hyundai/Kia I think we need to be watching them. The first Gen Stinger is a looker and performs well, but isn't perfect. Give the mid life cycle and next Gen I think the Germans will have problems. For the price of my 330i, I could have bought the top of line Stinger GT and have money leftover and the V6 Stinger is quicker than a 340/440i.  On the other hand, I have fallen in love with the Volvo V90, the design is stunning, and the price is perfect and you don't see many Wagons on the road."
374,"January 20, 2018  3:48PM",roadburner,"My non-negotiables are RWD, ample(some would say ""too much"") hp, and top-shelf handling and braking- so yes, I'd at least consider a Stinger GT. It could be a bit quicker, but aside from that I would just need to drive it. As dino001 mentioned, for me the primary drawback would be the buying process and probably service as well. At least with BMW I know that I won't have a warranty claim denied because I take my car to HPDEs."
375,"January 20, 2018  3:56PM",roadburner,"Before I bought my M235i I also considered a Camaro SS 1LE, a Challenger SRT8, a 2013 Boss 302, a 2016 Mustang GT Premium w/Performance Package, a Lotus Elise, a 370Z NISMO, a Cayman S, and a WRX STI, so I didn't confine myself to the ELLPS market segment. If I was buying a new car today it would almost certainly be an M2 with three pedals; If I wanted another automatic I'd likely go with a fully optioned M240i with sunroof delete. Leasing? Maybe a Giulia TI, even though it isn't that quick."
376,"January 20, 2018  4:20PM",stickguy,"I just read the latest road and track last night, and they had a stinger review. They list it at 4.6 0-60, and 13 seconds 1/4 at 109 MPH. Top speed of 167. If that is not enough performance for street use, you need to take up NHRA."
377,"January 20, 2018  5:13PM",roadburner," To each his own; my personal standard is a sub-thirteen second quarter mile- and my 2er just barely qualifies.. Note that I didn't say the GT was slow, only that it could be a bit quicker. The Stinger GT's performance is solidly average for its class- which isn't bad."
378,"January 20, 2018  5:40PM",qbrozen,"Have to remember, as far as I know, the Stinger's class is midsized. Yet magazines always seem fixated on comparing everything to the compact 3-series instead."
379,"January 20, 2018  5:54PM",flightnurse, That is because Kia used the 3 series and its benchmark.
380,"January 20, 2018  5:56PM",flightnurse,"RR mentioned the Giulia TI, which won Car of the Year. I loved the one I drove, but Alfa needed to rethink their leases, for a 45K car they wanted 3K down, and payments of $550/m But today you can get that same car for min down and 420/m which is in line with BMW."
381,"January 20, 2018  8:49PM",Mr_Shiftright," As does (did) every other automaker. BMW practically invented ""sport sedan"", even before they got that posh image."
382,"January 20, 2018  9:37PM",andres3," Depending where you look, you might find different numbers. I found 4.2 0-60 and 12.8 quarter miles reported for my '16 TTS. Of course, my car cheats by only having 2 doors and being a coupe, so it's not a sedan, nor entry level."
383,"January 21, 2018  2:25AM",dino001," The car is great so far. I picked it up in Munich in June, drove south to Switzerland, then southern France (Provance), swept along Cote d’Azur to Milan and back to Munich. Then picked it up in Spartanburg in late Septempebr and drove home to Tampa. Now it’s almost 9 thosand miles and perfect. Have to admit, although I miss the sound of my previous straight six, the four cylinder turbo is both quicker less thirsty by 20 percent. Even the automatic doesn’t bother me, it’s probably one of the best in the market. The electric steering, which used to be a major issue with early F3x generation, is finally fixed. It’s precise, albeit lighter than my previous 328. No longer Buick like. I think they tweaked standard 4-series, including GC to be slightly more sporty than standard 3. The standard suspension is also quite alright. I got luxury package without adaptive suspension and don’t feel like missing anything.  In other words, the car is just fine with my growing up and getting stiffer in the joints, but maintains most important aspects of the handling. And there is that rear hatch"
384,"January 21, 2018  2:27AM",dino001, 3 series in no longer compact. It grew in both size and weight. It is a legitimate midsize today.
385,"January 21, 2018  5:11AM",qbrozen,"Current 3-series sedan is 182"". 5-series is 194. Kia is 190. So definitely closer to the 5 than the 3."
386,"January 21, 2018  1:13PM",circlew,"I looked at a white StingerGT2 2 weeks ago. I sat it in and it had far more room than my Q50S. I mentioned that it looked like a 5'er interior to the sales person. The exterior is far more upscale that is more up to date than a 3'er, IMHO."
387,"January 21, 2018  1:50PM",dino001," So the Stinger looks like a legitimate effort from Kia. Let’s hope people will buy it, so it stays in the market. If it is 5-series size, then $50k+ sticker for fully loaded fast supercharged V6 may be ok, considering Kia always throws in decent cash incentives. Low end 2 liter starts 35k, so that’s much more pallatable and separated in price from lux and comparable to four cyl turbos from other brands, too. One knock against is the mpg on GT, when you compare it with, say BMW’s 3.0 six turbo. It souns a bit like the previous gen without much fuel asavinlg tech. It may be a positive for some."
388,"January 21, 2018  1:52PM",dino001, These are full lengths. More important would be wheel base and cabin space/legroom. Does anybody have those handy?
389,"January 21, 2018  5:33PM",Mr_Shiftright, Sounds like the 2 liter might be the better bang for the buck.
390,"December  8, 2017  1:20PM",flightnurse, What fires?
391,"December  8, 2017  3:52PM",roadburner,My son received his for his E90 328i.

It includes several BMW 3 Series models from 2006-11 with wiring and electrical conductors in the climate control system that are vulnerable to overheating, BMW told the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration on Thursday.  The second, larger recall involves the 2008-11 128i and various other 2007-11 models with six-cylinder engines, such as the 328i and the 525i.""  source: NY Times"
395,"December  9, 2017  5:12PM",roadburner,"The second recall involves the heated PCV valve. I talked with several techs at work and a couple of them said that they had seen blower motors with connectors that had gotten hot, but none of them looked like they were anywhere close to catching fire. No one had seen the PCV issue."
396,"December  9, 2017  5:26PM",Mr_Shiftright,"If you are the one affected, then the casualty rate is 100%"
397,"December 19, 2017  2:22AM",sweendogy,I've looked at a few different chats(blogs) here at edmunds and have been very impressed by the responses (certainly in the lease/deal sections) from the moderators. Nice work.

399,"January 16, 2018 11:16PM",flightnurse,"Boy, this forum has died.  So I've had my 330i now for 8 months, and I like it. Just had the car coded and applied the Dinan Sport tune. It gives a modest HP gain (25hp) but a healthy torque (50lbs) increase. It took 2 complete sleep cycles to feel the additional 50 lbs of torque. Not bad for $200 tune. This car just amazes on how the milesage I am getting with it, combined I'm getting a very solid 28.5, took a trip to Santa Fe, averages 34 on that trip, Ricks GT averaged 34 a few weeks later.

404,"January 17, 2018  3:05AM",roadburner, They can; a lot depends on the dealer and the amount of the warranty claim.
405,"January 17, 2018  3:08AM",stickguy,"considering it is just a software update, it really should not be all that expensive. Well, it could be if the value is there, but not like there is much labor or parts involved.  as to ELLPs, I like them. Can't really afford a new one at this point, but I did really like the TLX. would however prefer it was a size smaller. A modern version of the ILX would be just right. Though more likely they kill that off.  but, right now, I am following the trend in the country of being more interested in a CUV alternative (the upcoming RDX). All the goodies, most of the performance, and a big square cargo area for convenience. Actually, for us, anything in this class would have to be the primary family car, and that is likely to always be something practical, like the RDX."
406,"January 17, 2018  3:15AM",andres3,"  Tuners claim the cost is to reimburse them for R&D, since it is just software."
407,"January 17, 2018  3:19AM",stickguy,"oh sure, just like Microsoft, etc.  like the old joke about the mechanic (or plumber, but hey, this is a car forum) that got called in, took one look, turned a screw 1 turn, and was done.

As I recall, when dealers first started offering DInan tunes on the N55, it bumped them like 30hp and cost 50% more than the aftermarket units that offered double the power increase. I could be misremembering some details, but I believe that was the gist."
411,"January 17, 2018  3:24PM",flightnurse, Not at the dealer many aftermarket companies
412,"January 17, 2018  3:25PM",flightnurse," This is true, however, I'm not worried as I don't abuse the engine enough be concerned."
413,"January 17, 2018  4:02PM",qbrozen, Doesn't the dealer offer a tune? Or did they stop that?
414,"January 17, 2018  4:39PM",flightnurse, BNW does not offer one for the 4 cyl in the US only the 6.
415,"January 17, 2018  6:00PM",andres3," I did raise an objection to the tunes for the S4 (and TTS) for that matter costing more than the A3 tune. The S4's is the most expensive.  I asked if ""the cost was based on the MSRP and assumed bank account of said owners?""  The answer was that there were more 2.0T engines to spread the costs around than 3.0T (supercharged) engines. In fact, the 2.0T is used in VW's like the GTI. The 3.0 was limited to S4, Q5, A6, & A7."
416,"January 17, 2018  6:26PM",andres3,"For a while years back Audi let Stasis get in bed with them.  For people that were afraid of losing their warranty, they were perfect.  Of course, all Stasis really did was this:  GIAC tuning, which you could get from GIAC I'm sure they sourced someone for a forged 20"" wheel. Alcon brake systems, rotors, calipers, and slapped the Stasis name on it. AWE exhaust, and slapped the Stasis engraving on the tips. I'm sure the coil-overs and sway bars were outsourced too.  I wonder if they did anything themselves.  Of course, I do remember noticing that KW used Koni Dampers."
417,"January 18, 2018  9:06PM",flightnurse,"As prices continue to climb what is really an ELLP? If you are talking about the base model, mid-level model?  My 330 MSRP was 47K, far from the base, and far from being fully loaded. What equipment makes it a ELLP? My 330 does not have leather. Now is my 330 a sports sedan, I would say YES to that. The base suspension is firmed up from previous year F30's, I have 18"" rims with Performance tires, the standard seats are now the Sports seats. The steering feel is a little better than in the past, overall I have enjoyed this car. I just wish BMW would allow you to really custom build a car, I would love the M Sports Suspension without the body kit, this to included the M Steering wheel. I feel this is the only thing I'm missing from my car.  So you think manufacturers are getting away from Sport Sedans perse and more into the ELLP?"
418,"January 19, 2018  2:08PM",Mr_Shiftright,I think it's a combination of badge + price more than the individual options list---although we do expect an ELLP not to be spartan in any way.
419,"January 19, 2018  2:26PM",kyfdx,"I'm pretty sure that @Kirstie_H laid out the list.  It starts with a luxury make. So, Acura, Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Infiniti, Jaguar, Lexus, Lincoln, Mercedes, and Volvo.  So, that's the minimum to qualify.  A 3-series sedan is an ELLPS, for the purposes of this discussion."
420,"October 20, 2017 12:11PM",qbrozen,"dino001 said: show previous quotes I find Audi, BMW and Kia at top almost shocking. Especially Audi. Interestingly enough, VW is way to the bottom, so it seems even though they share some parts, the overall QC must be much better there. Also, Porsche being closer to VW than to Audi is interesting. I will believe Chrysler's improvement (it jumped over other domestics) if it remains there for a few years. And where is Fiat? Off the scale? I am also wondering about Fiat. They were WAY down at the tail end before, so I'm pretty sure there is still one worse than Caddy."
421,"October 20, 2017 12:31PM",pensfan83,I guess there isn't enough data for Alfa Romeo yet?
422,"October 20, 2017 12:42PM",dino001," Well, I didn't have much experience with Audi, except my late dad's 2004 A4 TDI (in Poland) that's still with the family, but enough people complained about it even on Edmund's forums, like GG's infamous S4 problems and inept response from the service departments (this was before his even more disastrous CTS when the service guy blamed ""wrong gas"" for for problems with the entertainment system). BTW, I have to say from years of posting, GG looks like a magnet for bad cars.  I'm sure Audi improved, I just found very surprising that they are now at top 3. BTW, I was happy to see BMW also climbing to near top. I wonder if Audi will offer similar warranty to VW (6/72 btb!), or perhaps they're doing well enough and VW is just putting a last ditch effort to salvage the market."
423,"October 20, 2017  1:18PM",stickguy,Acura is probably entirely related to the 9 speed AT
424,"October 20, 2017  1:27PM",ab348, Nor with BMW or Toyota. I guess my 2 flawless Cadillacs don't count either.
425,"October 20, 2017  1:44PM",stickguy,"Well, in a survey, any individual response really doesn't mean much."
426,"October 20, 2017  3:55PM",graphicguy," dino....seems that way, doesn't it.  Stick....I think that ZF transmission was an issue for Acura. While I never owned the '15 TLX, from what I understand the trans was tuned ALL WRONG in that drivetrain.  The one in my '19 behaves quite well and reminds me a whole lot of the ZF trans I had in my 335i several years ago.  So, perhaps Honda/Acura got all of that sorted out with ZF."
427,"October 20, 2017  3:59PM",stickguy,"quite likely. there is also some time lag to those surveys, so what you buy today may be different than what got dinged.  besides, at this point, with very few exceptions (ALfa?) the bar is set so high, that even the ""worst"" brand is pretty darned good. especially considered where most were not all that long ago."
428,"October 20, 2017  8:01PM",Mr_Shiftright,"  I wouldn't give Audi that much slack, to say that they were reliable in the mid 2000s. I think it took a few years longer than that for them to get quality control UNDER control."
429,"October 21, 2017  3:06AM",andres3," Oh it counted, and is the reason Audi didn't ever surpass Lexus.  However, I will say the problems he experienced with one Audi pale in comparison to 3 Cadillac's in a row he had."
430,"October 21, 2017  3:11AM",andres3," Well, they did tend to have AC issues, intake module issues, fuel pump and cam follower issues, and maybe a couple other things (like open sky double moon-roof issues, window regulator issues, and center console latch issue). For a lot of those things they issued super long courtesy 7 year 120 K warranties though as goodwill, and the failure rate was far from 100%. I had a window regulator and AC go bad, and I needed the intake module replaced on my A3 by 106,000 miles (didn't opt for the Open sky so you can't break what you don't have).  Getting a big check to reimburse me for the intake module after the fact went a long way towards making me forget some of those minor issues. Still, considering I drove it like I stole it, was a reliable 06 model.  It was no Lexus, but it wasn't a Neon either. For example, the A3 never needed to be towed."
431,"October 21, 2017  3:19AM",andres3," They count, but you've only had the 2nd one for how long? @qbrozen had a good experience with one too, but he owned it for about as long as a Neon is reliable too.  Still, batting .666 or so with cars isn't good. Anyone else around here own a good Caddy recently?"
432,"October 21, 2017  3:21AM",andres3," You didn't own the Infiniti long enough, but it seems the Asian brands are your anti/counter-magnet to getting bad cars as @dino001 put it."

435,"October 21, 2017  3:02PM",graphicguy," Good point!  Nothing really wrong with the Infiniti. I think they softened it too much. The twin turbo 6 was good. Transmission was a bit lazy, but nothing really wrong with it.  I think I was hoping for more of what the previous generation offered with the 3.7, which was much sportier. Infiniti went in the opposite direction."

However, I will say the problems he experienced with one Audi pale in comparison to 3 Cadillac's in a row he had.   But you never mentioned him I'm sure it was an oversight.

Check out this review - it might.  http://www.thedetroitbureau.com/2017/10/first-drive-2018-kia-rio/  Best of all, there’s a lot more driving fun than you’d expect in an entry-level scooter, especially considering its front struts, rear torsion beam setup. Its progressive and predictable in its behavior, so much so, you might wonder when the hot hatch variant will arrive, something you would never say of a Kia Rio in past form. It lacks the expected Korean floatiness and excessive brake dive, even at extremes. Take a corner too fast, brake hard and crank the wheel and the Rio will scrub off speed while maintaining way more grip than you’d come to expect. Credit the car’s rigid structure; the suspension pieces themselves are nothing special.  When it comes to tech, Kia has you covered with Bluetooth, a six-speaker stereo with satellite radio and a rear-view camera system, seven-inch touchscreen infotainment system with Android Auto and Apple CarPlay. Standard safety features include six airbags, side-impact door beams, electronic stability control, anti-lock brakes, hill-start assist and vehicle stability management.  There's a brand new 2018 Kia Rio5 over at George Gee Kia in Spokane Valley, WA, selling for $14,795. 6-speed stick model."
452,"October 18, 2017  3:37PM",roadburner," Probably closer than you think if the 330i has the base suspension. If the 3er has the M Sport or the Adaptive M Suspension all bets are off. Neither car is a rocket sled, but the with a 0-60 in the mid-fives and a fourteen second quarter mile 330i is about 0.5 seconds quicker than the Mazda. The 330i will likely return better fuel economy, especially if equipped wit the superb ZF 8HP automatic.  I don't like FWD in anything larger than a Mini Cooper, so I'd go with the 330i- in RWD of course."

454,"October 18, 2017  4:04PM",brian125,  Getting the upgraded 15 wheels on a fire red Rio may help in the agility tests.  Buick Regal GS vs Mazda6 might be a better square off. The New 2018 Regal is updated and refreshed this year. Lets see if GM builds on some previous model positives . Regal's 2.0- turbo accelerated 0 to 60 mph in 7.2 sec. The Rio just may give it a run for its money down a straightaway

459,"October 18, 2017  7:59PM",Michaell, Yet I get the feeling we've strayed a bit off topic this last day or two.  Anybody in the market for an ELLPS?
460,"October 18, 2017  8:27PM",stickguy,"Not any longer! Though my looking supported a theory of mine. This class is hurting, because the competition from below is fierce. Mainstream cars, for much less money, that are so good already that the extra money is hard to justify for many people. Especially in the smaller models."
461,"October 18, 2017  9:22PM",tlong," Also prices have continued to skyrocket in ELLPS. I know what I bought my Audi A4 for in 1998, and I'm not gonna spend my money on their current prices. So ELLPS is more or less out of what I want to pay.  However there are some decently compelling ""mundane"" cars that can be loaded up to levels that approach (and sometimes exceed) ELLPS. If you want the badge then you go ELLPS. If you want much of the actual benefit and to save some cash, then dropping down a market notch is not a bad idea."
462,"October 18, 2017  9:31PM",laurasdada," That's the fun of shopping, looking, smelling, tasting, trying on, driving... Funny, seats, while comfortable, have kinda short bottom cushion for my taste. Gotten used to/adjusted, so no worries. Maybe the one you looked at had the upgraded seats? I have standard black interior, not my first choice, but when you're buying from inventory on New Year's Eve, variety is not your spice of life! I like the overall interior, a bit too much aluminum staring me in the face for my taste, but enough wood to keep me warm.  The rotating vents are a cool feature....the first couple of times you see 'em. You can easily program them to stay open, which I will do as soon as the warranty expires!  Drove into Boston for dinner/show Saturday night. Parking garage, didn't realize until I was all the way in that it was valet only. The attendant told me no worries, they always take special care of Jags! Uh, huh."
463,"October 18, 2017 10:45PM",stickguy,"well, my pending Elantra sport is an interesting example, compared to my son's A3. Not as many gizmos (his is loaded). But similar size, comparable performance (short of Quattro), many same features. similar ride and handling. Less prestigious badge. But for most people, not a huge difference. Other than price, which was a full $20,000 cheaper.  put another way, you can get so much car for 20-25K now, that justifying 40-50k is hard (assuming you even have the budget to pull it off!)"
464,"October 19, 2017  1:48AM",Michaell," Interesting - forgot about the A3 in your family. A longer term comparison will be interesting. Gotta have your son drive the Hyundai and offer his opinion. Better yet, let him take it to NY and drive it for a month (when the weather is nicer)."
465,"October 19, 2017  2:49AM",roadburner,If you want a RWD sport sedan the mainstream brands really don't offer any competition- although the Genesis G80/G90 and the KIA Stinger are notable exceptions. If you don't care which wheels are driven and simply want a wide assortment of gadgets then a bread and butter sedan may well be the way to go.
466,"October 19, 2017  6:08AM",andres3," But is it really comparable?  220 HP vs. 201 hp for the Hyundai Torque disparity is larger I believe if I'm not mistaken. 24/33 MPG vs. 26/33 for the Hyundai; now that's close, but the Audi engine is 20% bigger. Car and Driver is posting 5.4 0-60 time for A3 Quattro, with 129 MPH Top Speed  Wasn't able to find figures on the Elantra Sport (too many trims)."
467,"October 19, 2017 12:57PM",Michaell,  I think the point is you can get 80% (or more) of the performance and features for 50% of the price.

But, seeing it, what it offers, and comparing it to something like a Lexus ES300 or IS, and the lines begin to blur.

The 330 feels more planted, doesn't want to push as much in the corner and I know I can take my fave on and off ramps faster. I feel that the base suspension on the 2016 and newer 3 series is better than before. Now Rick's GT has the Adaptive suspension and I like it, I wish mine had it.. But overall I can't see how a Mazda 6 would come close to a base 3 series on a road course or figure 8"
473,"October 19, 2017  4:06PM",flightnurse," LOL ah, the good old day when ELLPS were cheap... The price of your 1998 A4 is the same cost of a middle-level Nissan Altma.. Have fun with one of those."
474,"October 19, 2017  5:36PM",tlong," That's true in most markets, not just cars. If you want the best you pay $$$$ If you are happy at 70-80% you can pay perhaps 50% of the high end. Examples: Smart phones TVs Computers Watches (more than a 2:1 ratio here!) I'm sure many more"

Interestingly enough, VW is way to the bottom, so it seems even though they share some parts, the overall QC must be much better there. Also, Porsche being closer to VW than to Audi is interesting.  I will believe Chrysler's improvement (it jumped over other domestics) if it remains there for a few years. And where is Fiat? Off the scale?"
477,"October 20, 2017  2:11AM",andres3," Audi's been providing the icing with the cake since the mid 2000's. Where have you been? Pretty darn consistent at the top right behind Lexus for luxury makes the last 5 years or so. Still, not at Lexus reliability levels yet (or ever).  I think we all saw Cadillac tumbling coming based on @graphicguy experiences. Unlike some that write-off personal experiences reported here as anecdotal, I take it to likely be ""par"" for the course as that is statistically most likely to happen. BMW's improvement is both significant and recent. They weren't that hot in prior years.  Kia has been inching toward the top for awhile now too. One of the reasons I got one, as they surpassed Honda and Acura for a few years now. Audi's QC is most definitely superior to VW's. Has been for a long time, and most Audi's are still made in Europe while VW's in Mexico.  As to Chrysler's improvement, they had no where to go but up."

496,"October 16, 2017  1:58PM",dino001,"I just bought 2018 430i Gran Coupe. Keen eye would see subtle difference with the 330 sedan, but from a distance they both look similar. BMW has made a decent progress in addressing my largest complaint, i.e. steering wheel and suspension feel. It's not quite as heavy as my previous 2018 328, but it got to the area where it's no longer Buick. The interior is improved, the stitched plastic dashboard cover is a nice touch. One thing that feels really old and tired, are the speedometer and odometer. Almost the same as they were 10 years ago, which were almost the same as those 10 years prior that. I even joke that those BMW designers obsess about their engine, transmission and everything else, then three weeks before launch they suddenly realize that they need a new dashboard, so they stick the old one, again."
497,"October 16, 2017  2:35PM",flightnurse," When it comes to looks, you can tell BMW is playing it safe, the look is evolution and bold and in your face like what Acura had done to the TL, I think the BMW is a handsome sedan. I'm not 100% sold on the new C class but like the looks of the A4."

When I was preparing to change from my wagon, I made peace with AT as my next transmissions already some time ago. I decided that the form factor (body type) with equipment and color were more important than the transmission. The transmission is alright - very responsive, efficient, seamless. It isn't manual, but it will do.  I thought I wanted 435, then 440 GC all that time until I spent some good time with the 430/330, got to play with the sport/sport+ modes and became convinced to keep the money, both in the purchase and at the pump. For me it's good enough. I think I'm already past the ""got to have the horses"" stage. There is minimum I want/need, of course, probably higher than the market average, but 430 is quite enough."

I lucked out in 2014 when it came to the A4 however this time my dealer had no manual A4's in stock and no immediate plans to order any, my salesman said they sell on average less than 4-5 per year and most times they sit waiting for a buyers like folks on this board, who are becoming rarer by the day. Like @dino001 I resigned myself to the fact the next car was going to be an auto, which opened up many more options because finding a manual entry level luxury car is like finding hen's teeth. It did also open up another vehicle for my wife to drive, who was confined to her Altima the last 3 years."

While only test drives, I never experienced the untoward behavior of the 9-speed transmission in the V6 TLX that others reported. That said, the ones I drove were all in the last 18 mos, and perhaps Acura addressed those issues.  Be interested in the '18 TLX to see if they tweaked more than just the styling."

515,"May 16, 2017  6:09PM",andres3, You'll be fine. The B8.5 S4 is one of the finest cars ever made. Find a good indy shop for the services. My TTS was quoted $450 (w/ DSG) for the 35K service. I imagine the S4 would be within 10% of that at most.  I can't imagine (if you've had no issues the first 37K miles) that you'll have any issues the next 37K miles.
516,"May 16, 2017 11:57PM",sweendogy,"Andres3 - yes no issues yet and I enjoy it a great deal. Was told I need new summer tires soon which will be expensive.  The sales numbers quoted above are they m/m or y/y for a said month? TLX awd at somewhere near 35k is a scream - styling aside as someone said rock solid cars. Have to feel bad for Acura- it seems Honda is leaving all the good stuff (save for nsx) under the Honda umbrella. Cr-v, New civic - civic si - and type r - never hear anything about Acura. do they ever advertise there sedans ?"
517,"May 17, 2017  1:47AM",stickguy,"Acura got out of the sporty/hot car deal a while ago. And they do have a Civic and CRV (ILX and RDX). They are both just ready to be replaced. For the last models, they followed about 6-12 months after the Honda doner car was redesigned."

519,"May 17, 2017  3:24AM",stickguy,"I had my eye on the TLX all along. Though I did kinda forget about it there for a while, but now back on the list. At least the wife likes it a lot too, which of course will make my life more pleasant!"
520,"May 18, 2017 12:40AM",sweendogy,Seems acura got out of the sedan/car biz for what seems 10 years ... Maybe more. They used to compete vs Lexus. Now it seems Buick.
521,"May 18, 2017 11:50AM",sda,If I was in the market now the TLX with technology 4 or V6 would be high on my list. I have been very pleased with Honda products.
522,"May 18, 2017  3:49PM",andres3," I think even Honda fans will Admit that there's a reason Acura can't get much more than 90% of MSRP on their sedans the last decade or so though. Combination of overpriced and under-delivering in my opinion.  Acura needs it mojo back. I think Infinity is the new Honda/Acura, and Honda/Acura has become Buick.  Maybe the new Civic Si, Type R, and NSX will prove me wrong, but the NSX is a niche product."
523,"May 27, 2017  1:40AM",sweendogy,"While I agree Acura has become Buick - don't get me going on them- Infiniti has become even more irrelevant. While Acura has the MDX, Infiniti has zero products that are upper third (half) of any category in Luxury market. They used to have the g sedan and coupe (something Acura and Lexus forgot about) that actually sold and could compare to BMW 3."
524,"May 27, 2017  3:52AM",qbrozen,"Yeah, it doesn't compare. it has surpassed the 3."
525,"May 27, 2017  2:14PM",sweendogy,If you are talking Mazda 3 I agree. Infiniti doesn't want it's used cars back. (I would guess BMW is similar) http://www.startribune.com/flood-of-off-lease-used-cars-push-prices-down-upend-market/424537303/
526,"May 27, 2017  4:21PM",roadburner,At my dealer we take in a lot of the off-lease BMWs and sell them as CPO or CPO Elite cars.
527,"May 27, 2017  4:34PM",tlong,"When I bought my 2005 Acura TL in late 2004, Acura was on a roll with the best looking car (IMHO, still love that styling) and Infiniti had the G35 which was also a looker and doing well. Fast forward 12 years and Acura has lost it, and so seems has Infiniti, at least in the sporty sedan arena. Audi is resurgent and BMW is treading water/surviving on it's long standing reputation. And I think cars in general are less of an interest than then, with Tesla/electrics, hybrids, Uber, Lyft all competing for transportation, along with gadgets and the internet for people's cash."
528,"May 28, 2017 12:02AM",flightnurse, Local Acura dealers are discounting the TLX 4 cyl with tech 7K. Not too sure if a TLX is a good idea unless you are shopping strictly on price.
529,"May 28, 2017  1:11AM",stickguy,I really like the TLX. Just fits me well.
530,"May 29, 2017  2:43AM",sweendogy,TL TLX amazed how Acura got it wrong... Here is the new TLX http://blog.caranddriver.com/fresh-faced-value-2018-acura-tlx-pricing-announced/
531,"May 29, 2017  2:54AM",flightnurse,"Went and drove a 4 cyl with Tech and 6 cyl W/ tech and was disappointed. I think Acura is the new Infiniti in which they lost their Mojo. It's sad to see this, it's even sadder that Infiniti has to use German Engines and Transmissions to get the powertrain right... It's even sadder that they are discounting the TLX do much to move them off the lots."
532,"May 29, 2017  3:32AM",stickguy,"I have not driven a 4 cyl yet, but really liked the 6 cyl I tried. But that is why they make so many different cars. something for (almost) everyone!  the big discounts now are thanks to clearing out for the new model.  Just curious, but what was so disappointing?"
533,"May 29, 2017  1:59PM",flightnurse," The big discounts is really because every car magazine panned and they aren't selling. The V6 does not feel like it has 290hp, in Sport+ the transmission does not shift and crisp and sharp as the 4 cyl. Now I will give the seats major props here very comfortable. The car drove with typical Japanese blandness very isolated feeling. Now, there is nothing wrong with that if that is your thing. The dealer I went really wanted me to take a 6cyl w/Tech but didn't see the real value in it. The only difference between a 4 and 6cyl Tech package is the engine and transmission there is not additional equipment in the 6 cyl since more manufacturers add features Honda/Acura does not."
534,"May 31, 2017  1:32AM",sweendogy,Infiniti and Acura are lost for sure... Lexus has at least made the effort with the (ugly?) IS.... They also have the volume es and rx to help the rest of the fleet. Infiniti has 2 highly discounted sedan and suv (pathfinder q) that I guess is the reason Nissan gives them a lifeline. Acura has one real product the MDX. Yes they have a super car which is cool but unfortunately in its current stable you can't look down the line and say it has a real bloodline. The old nsx had the integra r and gsr (had one) to point to.
535,"June  2, 2017  3:59PM",andres3,"I agree Acura seems to be lost; they gave up on their 3.7 engine, which is strange for Honda/Acura to give up on an engine so quickly.  Infinity, while the Q40/50/60S are all heavy cars, they do have a 400 HP Red-Line and 3.0 L turbocharged power-trains. They seem to be making an effort. I thought the 2.0T was an Infinity engine that Mercedes was using. If it is a Mercedes engine that Infinity is using, it does seem like a strange partnership.  Acura needs an ILX-S or ILX-R. TLX-S?"
536,"June 10, 2017  4:04AM",flightnurse,  I'm thinking Acura will be dropping a turbo 4 into the TLX within the next 2 yrs. Honda will have a Turbo 4 in the Accord next year.  Infiniti had to dump the VQ V6 it was a thirsty engine but don't understand why they had to go to MB for their engine...
537,"June 10, 2017  4:20AM",flightnurse,"Out with the old and in with the new. It was time to get a new car, my first choice was the Alfa loved how it drove, and for the price hard to beat, but when it came to lease payments, yicks... Basically told the dealer when they were serious about selling the car to call me. Volvo S60, nice car, but the MF and RV is horrible, so I moved on. Acura the dealer wanted to move a car, but wasn't all that thrilled on how it drive, either the 4-6 cyl Lexus IS, drove well, even though the dealer wanted to move a unit, the RV and MF were high as well as lease payments. MB I don't like the C sedan, even the C43 again they wanted to move a unit but the payments were high.  I went with a 2017 330i that was a service loaner, 2500 miles, Drivers assistance package, Premium Package, Nav, heated seats, Apple Car Play, 18: rims. 41K out the door, 2100 out of pocket, for fees, first month, and a small Cap reduction.  Have to say BMW has firmed up the standard suspension, to almost perfect, I have the same rims and Rick's GT, however, I have 225-45-18's, Ricks are 225-50-18. This car is light on its feet, the new B48 engine is a Gem, much much quieter than my 320i at idle, it drives like how a BMW should. I'm getting the car coded for added features and installing a BMS JB4 for added power."
538,"June 10, 2017 12:13PM",qbrozen,"Warning: the BMS will void your warranty. Unless the dealers have started offering it, which would shock me."
539,"June 10, 2017 12:20PM",stickguy,sounds like the car I would look at later in the year (the service loaner lease part). What did the before tax payment end up being on that?
540,"October 30, 2016  7:44PM",dino001,"XC60 is still only one line. That's the thing - most dealers didn't even stock R-line trims, so one wouldn't know about their existence without more extensive research. The salesman told me it's getting a little better after acquisition of Polestar, but will surely take time to get any following. Plus, those are much more risky models to stock, more expensive low volumes.  Regarding engines, everybody does strange stuff with engines today. Tripple scrollers, super/turbo charger mixes, batteries. It's just fact of life, especially on European brands."
541,"October 31, 2016  1:03PM",graphicguy,"@stever....if you bring some Edmunds Shwag with you, I'll let you camp out on my porch, but only if you hand our candy tonight to all the little terrors.....er.....angelic little children!"
542,"October 31, 2016  4:17PM",andres3," I've heard of and looked at them briefly. I believe I looked closely at a S60R that seemed on paper like a pretty close competitor to the S4. Unfortunately, I think it is more like an A4 competitor. It just doesn't win on any specification. And then I believe I saw that they put some rather small skinny 225 or 235 rubber tires on it (not 100% sure which on as it was a while ago). Base S4 starts at 245, with the upgrade wheel using 255. My wife's Sportwagen has 225. That's not a deal breaker as I like after-market wheels anyway, but to me it is a sign of how the engineer's really feel about the performance of their vehicle.  Now, I hope some auto exec doesn't read this and start a tire size war."
543,"December 22, 2016  5:04AM",flightnurse,"Not much talk in the last 2 months..  BMW has finally released the prices of the new 5 series, as I figured the base MSRP for the 530i went up 1 grand. It appears that is across the board, pricing guides and ordering guide will not be released until after the Detriot Auto show where the car will shown.  http://www.bimmerfest.com/forums/showthread.php?t=957126"

I've driven the 530i and I like it MUCH better than any F10 I have driven. The car feels a lot faster than I expected. It's still a bit too big for my tastes but it's really an impressive drive.

552,"January 27, 2017  9:55PM",roadburner," Because now every permutation gets a new number. The E36 code covered every 3 Series body style as well as the M3 and Z3. Now, each body style and M car gets its own number. It's just silly."
553,"January 27, 2017  9:59PM",roadburner," That's SOP for Munich, every extensive redesign is followed by a more conservative replacement. See: E12, E28, E34, E39, E60, F10. The G30 is the low key model transformation."
554,"January 27, 2017 10:00PM",andres3,"Audi Club guys like to refer to their A4's and S4's as B5 or B6, or B7, or B8, or now B9 A4's and S4's.  Personally, I think it's easier to remember date ranges for a model, like '10-'16 A4's and S4's are either B8 or get this; B8.5"
555,"January 27, 2017 10:04PM",dino001,"Year ranges are fine, but can be tricky, when certain model variations carry longer than others. Example: 2012 328 sedan was F30, but all other bodies were still E9x, like my wagon. IIRC 3-series convertible carried all through 2013, before being replaced by 2014 F3x 4-series."

No problems thus far with just routine maintenance to report along with one quarter panel needed to be replaced after the neighbor backed into it last feb. Just recently had the 35k service done which also included a transmission flush and filter replacement. Funny thing about Audi service they don't advertise Audi care - which you can bundle 2 10k services for 800 bux. Not cheap but considering the 35k service alone I was quoted 900 - and that's just for One service. Car performs great in all weather - snow tires are a huge plus for this car up north and make it unstoppable while moving just don't try to get it thru a snow bank more the 8 inches

Sales rep said it was $1k below invoice MF 0.00088 with 3.5K in MSDs 1.5k in taxes, $925 acq fee, misc dmv fees, luxury tax, and first payment = another 3.5k  term 10k/36: 0.66 Residual  Monthly: $497  So basically his payment is $497 so you round up to the nearest 50, so that would be $500x7 = 3500. This loweres your MF down.  Hope this helps."

Mercedes sold 4,921 S-Classes, and the BMW 7 Series came in third with 3,634 units sold. That puts Tesla's share of the segment, which includes 12 different vehicles, at 32 percent. It's by and large the king of this segment, helped by a 59 percent year-over-year improvement. The Tesla S is a beautiful vehicle very classy and luxurious. Shame its range is useless in my world."
603,"October 14, 2016  4:25PM",flightnurse," and this.. Mercedes-Benz extended its lead in a race with BMW for the luxury-car sales crown, as a series of new models position it to overtake its rival for the first time in a decade.  A jump in deliveries of SUVs and crossovers helped Mercedes increase sales almost twice as fast as BMW in the first nine months, expanding the Daimler AG unit's lead to 57,985 cars, according to data released by the manufacturers.  Mercedes is poised to achieve its 2020 target of unseating BMW AG's namesake brand as the world's biggest seller of premium vehicles already this year, Daimler CEO Dieter Zetsche said this week, which would put Mercedes back on top for the first time since 2005.  Mercedes is winning over customers with a recently updated lineup of trendy models that appeal to younger buyers, including the GLC coupe and compact GLA sport utility vehicle.  BMW is responding with a revamp of its 5-Series business sedan to rival Mercedes's popular E-Class, adding new self-driving features that control speed, help drivers stay in lane and keep distance to nearby cars.  The 5-Series, set to hit showrooms in February, will range from a four-cylinder hybrid plug-in that can drive 45 kilometers on a single charge, to a more powerful eight-cylinder gasoline version, BMW said in a statement on Thursday.  The car is critical for BMW after an overhaul of its top-of-the-line 7-Series sedan received a muted response.  BMW has downplayed the impending loss of the No. 1 spot, shifting its view to maximizing profit and fund investments in new technologies.  ""Profitability remains our primary focus,"" BMW's head of sales Ian Robertson said in a statement on Thursday.  New entrants  Luxury-car makers are racing to compete on self-driving innovations while also having to spend more on developing electric cars to meet increasingly tough emissions regulation.  BMW, Mercedes and Volkswagen AG's Audi brand last month outlined a major push into electric cars, which will add to their research-and-development costs. After hiking investment in plants, equipment and new technology from a peak this year, Daimler plans to rein back spending in the years ahead, CEO Zetsche said this week.  BMW's global deliveries rose 9.4 percent to 197,419 cars in September, boosting the nine-month total by 6 percent to 1.48 million vehicles, the company said in a statement.  By comparison, Mercedes's sales jumped 12.1 percent to 211,286 vehicles in September, lifting the total by 11.7 percent to 1.54 million, according to a separate statement. Audi slipped further back in third place with year-to-date deliveries of 1.41 million cars, a 4.5 percent gain.  Contact Automotive News"

Excellent all around vehicle without the fun factor of driving a S6, or BMW 550. The problem with this new G80 is.... looks to much like a Sonata from the back for 55k.  If you could get over the looks of this G80 / G90 vehicle it will pamper you with its amenity's. The 429 h/p , 9spd Trans is superb.

I'm keeping it because they don't make receivers like the two I own anymore. When the Denon konks out I'll switch back to the HK. Heck, I might switch out yearly just for the fun of it.

Genesis is a great bang for your buck and will pamper you with many amenities in the 42 to 52k price range. What I liked about the new model is the warranty, Largest car in its class. , ultra quiet ride, radio, 3 mode suspension, command center and large screen, everything inside is laid out nice and easy to use. The new redesign / wheels look terrible.  Its a perfect vehicle for folks who want a steady ride and could care less about brand or how uninspiring this vehicle seems when driven like the Audi , Bmw, or MB. Genesis 429 h/p and 9 spd trans works well in this vehicle. I call this new Genesis ( G80 ) the upper class large family sedan bargain .  The Camry XSE V-6 will take some sales away from the Honda Accord. I had a 13 Accord V-6 for 1yr. Very nice vehicle.

We don't expect to see any G30 5ers at our center until late January at the earliest- and those will all be in either 530i or 540i trim.

638,"September 17, 2016 11:56AM",qbrozen,Multiple security deposits
639,"September 17, 2016  1:07PM",flightnurse," MSD's mean Multi Security Deposits, we are taught that when leasing one should never put any money down. However, with MSD, you are basically buying down the money factor (APR) of the lease, which means lowerimg your monthly payment. At the end of your lease you will get your MSD's back or if you want and lease another BMW you can roll the MSD's into your new lease. The added saving for a typical 3 yr lease is about $1900."
640,"September 17, 2016  3:55PM",Mr_Shiftright,And the benefits to the leasing company are what exactly?....that you get someone to lease who might not have? Or get them into a more expensive lease rather than the one they first chose prior to the MSD bait?
641,"September 17, 2016  4:45PM",flightnurse," The benefit isn't to the leasing company, and those who understand leasing and can negotiate well, can get a better deal with the MSD, then without."
642,"September 17, 2016  4:50PM",Mr_Shiftright,"So who does it benefit, is what I'm asking? Why create a system that makes less profit?"
643,"September 17, 2016  4:52PM",Michaell,"Mr_Shiftright said: So who does it benefit, is what I'm asking? Why create a system that makes less profit? The leasing company gets the use of the MSD funds for the duration of the lease. Add it up and you can make a decent amount of money if you invest it right. "
644,"September 17, 2016  4:58PM",Mr_Shiftright,"Ah, so they get the ""float"". I suppose if their money rate is 2.5%, then they can beat that by investing your money elsewhere.  MSDs weren't created for the benefit of mankind. I was just curious where the profit was."
645,"September 17, 2016  7:35PM",dino001," Like in every transaction, both sides get a benefit, or they at least think they do, since it's voluntary. Here, the lesee exchanges cash for lower cost of borrowing (money factor, by extension lower payment). In some way, it's similar to points on mortgage, but temporary, not permanent.  The lessor's benefit is cash today, which they can dispose as they see fit. Being a financial intitution, they are allowed to leverage that money to raise even more funds. Another benefit is more general, i.e. possible increase in product sales. Notice it's offered only by financial arms of some manufacturers."
646,"September 17, 2016  7:36PM",m6user,It's kind of like collateral.  Less risk for lender equals a liitle lower rate in addition to use of funds.
647,"September 18, 2016  4:31AM",roadburner,"If I max out the MSDs I can get a 24 month/10,000 miles per year lease on a 2016 i3 REX for less than $90 per month with no money down."
648,"September 18, 2016  4:56AM",Michaell," Yeah, I figured you could score an amazing lease deal as an employee. That's a $50k car, right?"

654,"September 18, 2016  3:01PM",kyfdx," It's the monthly payment rounded up to the next $50 increment times 7.  So, if you already have a super-cheap employee lease deal, the amount won't be very high. And, refundable, of course, so the only thing you are giving up is opportunity cost on the money."

I just returned from the mandatory one week instructor led training; there's a strong emphasis on product knowledge as well as how to relate to the clients that we work with. I don't fit the typical genius profile due to the fact that I'm retired from my ""real"" job and thus I'm considerably older; In my class of twenty the next oldest person was about ten years younger than me and the rest were in their early to mid twenties. In addition; I have no interest in a promotion to client advisor or service advisor- although I did ""sell"" a CPO i3 yesterday in that I conducted the presentation and evaluation drive so that the client advisor was able to close the deal in just a few minutes."
660,"July 27, 2016  2:15PM",Michaell," Exactly. The problem is, not all manufacturers offer MSD for leases. A quick summary - and I'll let @kyfdx chime in if my information is incorrect.  BMW - 7 MSDs at .00007 each - total MF reduction of .00049 Audi - 10 MSDs at .00005 each - total MF reduction of .00050 Lexus - 9 MSDs at .00008 each - total MF reduction of .00072 MB - no hard evidence on this; have had folks report that MSDs are only allowed on unsupported MF (standard MF is .00200 - .00220), but others have said otherwise  No MSD program for Infiniti or Acura. No information on Jaguar.  No MSD programs for any of the domestic brands."

663,"July 27, 2016  7:39PM",flightnurse," Dino it is being judgmental, but many people would agree with you, on BF some 23 yr old out of college wanting to lease a new 340i, his payments are $600/m cough.... Should he have gotten that car, no, but no one was going to stop him, and BMWFS sure wasn't..  The average saving is roughly $1900 on a course of a lease, however, to really save that money one needs to take that $50 you save a month and place it into a saving account so at the end of that 3 yr lease you have that money."
664,"July 27, 2016  7:42PM",flightnurse," MB has MSD, but they aren't offered in all states, just like Audi as well as BMW.  Jag currently does not offer that since all preferred leases go through Chase. I'm sure once Jag sets up a bank here in the states, they will offer MSD's."
665,"July 27, 2016  7:43PM",flightnurse," This is true, however, there are people who don't have 4K sitting around in a bank."
666,"July 27, 2016  7:50PM",andres3, What is the average monthly car payment nationwide? For both leases and buyers? I bet it wouldn't take a year of saving car payments to save up that $4K for most people.
667,"July 27, 2016  8:45PM",flightnurse," According to Edmunds.com, the average monthly payment on a new vehicle is $479. IF one wanted to make money on about 4K, one would use MSD's and save $50/m which is about 1900 on a three year lease. I can tell you one could get a nice 528i for $480/m with the currently RV that BMWFS is giving..."
668,"July 28, 2016  2:03AM",dino001," Right is right, that's why I wrote ""too judgmental"". Anyway, one can do whatever they want, but I can also voice my opinion about the action. I just don't want to hear their complaints about Bush, Obama, bankers, Wall Street, or global warming next time their life and income prospects turn less then anticipated.  BTW, last thing a 23 yo needs is 340i, but surely if they want to spend their ćurrent and future last dime, nobody other than their family or loving friends, should stop them. Surely not BMWFS, as long ad they meet the criteria. That much I agree."

675,"August  8, 2016  2:11PM",dino001,"I have always maintained Cadillac's dealer network is waaaay too big and does not fit a premium image they want to project. In small and midsize towns, local Chevy or Buick dealer also got a Caddy franchise, so they could sell them to small local business people and their families - model that worked in 70s, when German competition was small and super-exquisite (Benz only sold what today would have been loaded E-class or up, at price point equivalent to today's S-Class) and Japanese brands were literally non-existent.  In today's world with all-out competition in premium at all levels, it simply doesn't cut it - the accessibility is a good thing, but in today's reality it collides too much with exclusivity they wish to project. They'd do better if they pulled sales franchises from those weak dealers, but supplied them with authorized service licenses.  Essentially, you buy your Caddy in a big showroom, comparable to those of MB, BMW, or Lexus, in a nearby big city, but can service it at a local Buick dealer garage, provided it passes the necessary requirements. That model might actually work. In Europe they generally have denser authorized service network than sales. American model somehow is such that if you want to service a brand, you have to sell it, too. No real reason for that, other than ""tradition""."

677,"August  8, 2016  4:44PM",dino001,"The issue is, a non-related entity could also offer authorized service, at least in theory. Service does not have to be tied to sales. In this case, a Buick dealer could offer Cadillac service in small town. Or even it could be an completely independent provider, as long as the certification process is transparent and demanding enough. Unless there are some franchise laws, preventing such decoupling.

700,"July 25, 2016 12:59PM",benjaminh,"In the unlikely event anyone here would consider an Acura TLX as their entry-level luxury car, right now Edmunds is offering an exclusive $1500 incentive on that car. Once that's applied, I think someone could get a base 2016 TLX for close to the price of an Accord EXL, c. 26k. I considered this option, but ultimately decided the Accord EX was good enough for me, and it can be had for c. 3k less. Anyway, below, I think, is a link for the TLX incentive...  http://www.edmunds.com/elp/acura/ilx/offer/?fromIframe=true"
701,"July 25, 2016  9:36PM",stickguy,I am considering it. In 15 months. Not sure it will last that long.
702,"July 26, 2016  1:33AM",flightnurse,"BMW currently has some insane residual value on leases of 2016 5 series. 67% on 10K/36 month lease, 66% on a 12K/36 and 65% on 15K/36 month,"
703,"July 26, 2016  4:38AM",Michaell," And if you use MSD to buy down the MF, you can end up with a pretty amazing lease payment."
704,"July 26, 2016  4:52AM",roadburner,"In a bit over two months I'll have 90 days in, so I'm hoping BMW FS still has some attractive leases on something I find interesting..."
705,"July 26, 2016  6:31AM",tlong,"Re: the TLX, I had a 2005 TL that I sold recently at 156K miles. The TLX is the newer incarnation of that car, and with the somewhat improved appearance, I'm wondering why it seems the TLX doesn't sell anything like the '04-10-ish one did. I know it got ugly with the beak but it seems that it is at least decent looking now.  Has the market changed? Are we just bored with cars now? Or is it the looks as IMHO the TLX is still not as good looking as that vintage TL. It seems those mid-year TLs were everywhere and it was a hot seller, but I don't think so any more. And the ILX seems like even more of a bomb. Poor Acura is not doing so well these days."
706,"July 26, 2016  9:09AM",benjaminh," I think there are multiple things going on when it comes to the weak sales of the TLX. Like you, I think it has good styling, but probably for some it still seems to be a bit bland.  The base engine is a very nice 2.4 liter direct-injected model that's a more advanced version of what you get on the Accord. But most competitors have turbo base models that are faster.  The 8-speed in-house dual-clutch transmission on the TLX with the 2.4 has gotten mostly good reviews, but the 9-speed that goes with the V-6 has gotten mixed to negative reviews.  Acura doesn't seem to get much credit for its high quality, durability, and reliability. And the exotic 4-wheel steering that's standard on the car doesn't seem to help it stand out, but no doubt cost a pretty penny to engineer and put into the car.  Finally, the Accord now has AndroidAuto/AppleCarPlay, but the TLX isn't scheduled to get that until the early introduction of the restyled and enhanced TLX that's coming next year as a 2018 model."
707,"July 26, 2016 11:34AM",kyfdx,"I think that's it. They thought they could cover both the TL and the TSX market with one car, two different engines, but it's not working."
708,"July 26, 2016 11:47AM",graphicguy," Agreed. Plus, the Accord has now started knipping at the heals of the TLX. Acura's cars in their most recent iterations have been hit and miss. ILX, TLX, RLX (especially the RLX) have missed their respective marks, badly.  I still like the TLX (and all of my previous TLs). But, given the transmission woes, and that just about every other lux manufacturer out there offers AWD and some sort of torque vectoring system, which was at one time unique to the TL (and some Audis), isn't so unique any more.  I know holding the prices on the TLX trasnlates into higher resale value, but it's hurting their sales on the new end.  Let's face it, Acura is becoming more an SUV company than a car company."
709,"July 26, 2016  3:10PM",Mr_Shiftright," Yeah, but doesn't MSD sort of contradict why you lease in the first place?"
710,"July 26, 2016  3:42PM",kyfdx," Sort of... but, you get the money back at lease end. It's too good of a deal to pass up, in most cases. (even if the purpose of a lease is to not tie up a wad of cash)."
711,"July 26, 2016  5:22PM",dino001," Not really. Since it's a deposit, you get the money back. Since it lowers the MF, it can be seen as earning interest on the money. So if you take 7xSD, lowering MF on the entire lease amount, you essentially leveraged say 3 grand to reduce interest on say 30-40 grand (average capital cost between purchase and disposition). Translate that money back and you won't get anywhere near interest in a bank, if you keep the money. MSD is nothing like putting money down (cap cost reduction). Not even close. Don't put money down on lease, but MSD - good deal, IMHO."
712,"July 26, 2016  6:05PM",qbrozen, 3 whole years with the same car? Perish the thought.
713,"July 26, 2016  6:41PM",graphicguy,I like seeing old reviews by MotorWeek. Found this one last night. Seems as if Acura's current perceived value issues have deep roots.....
714,"July 27, 2016 12:02AM",andres3," Well, the '04+ TL was many great things:  1) A Power leader at 270 HP V6 3.2 Standard - In later years that became a 3.5 and 3.7 with good numbers. 2) Was a very good looking sedan with a nice interior. 3) Class-leading super modern audio DVD-audio playing music system (that's special and rare). 4) Handled really well.  The TLX currently in my opinion is:  1) Pretty bland; no visible exhaust either 2) A bottom feeder for power with either engine (as compared to the competition). They don't even offer a 3.7 anymore! 3) If the Audio systems still plays DVD-A discs I'd be surprised pleasantly, I don't know? I know the '14 TL did still play DVD Audio discs. 4) Handling is adequate but not particularly great."
715,"July 27, 2016  1:55AM",flightnurse," Yes, this is a great way to lower payments, however, more people don't have an extra 4K sitting around."
716,"July 27, 2016  1:58AM",flightnurse," You get the MSD back at the end of your lease, PLUS save about $50/m on your lease, so that averages out about $1900 on a 3 yr lease. So it's a win/win for you and BMW gets to use the MSD for 3 yrs. You are buying down the money factor of your lease, this where is where you get the saving from."
717,"July 27, 2016  8:29AM",brian125,If I remember correctly. Buying 1 MSD point down up to Seven is .000007 going to 000049 on the MF. The only Cons I see is coming up with the extra cash. If your car is totaled or stolen that money is still secure. If you flip your vehicle before lease is up who ever assumes it has to pay you your MSD money. Where can you make 1500 to 2000 dollars profit on that initial upfront investment in 3 yrs?? Its a good deal
718,"July 27, 2016 11:23AM",kyfdx," That's correct on a BMW, just take one zero out of each number. .00007 and .00049 Also correct on having someone assume your lease. They have to reimburse you for the MSDs."
719,"July 27, 2016  1:59PM",dino001," Well, not to sound too ""judgmental"", but I truly think somebody who can't come up with 4 grand, has no business shopping a 50 grand vehicle. This is to me something of category of complaining about premium gas on a luxury car. But that's probably just my weird math sense.  Also, it's just plain good savings. Not artificially on payment, like cap cost reduction, but real savings on total amount of money paid out of your pocket. If you do math correctly, that 0.00049 MF on 50K car with 25K residual (not so great one) saves you 0.00049*(50K+25K) times 36 (typical 36 month lease with not-so-hot residual) is 1300, give or take, more if the residual is higher. Who would pay you 1300-1500 bucks on 4 grand over three years???  It's probably one of the best guaranteed rate of return in zero-interest environment (adjusted for risk, of course). It of course is not a real rate of return, just savings in interest charges (or their equivalents in lease).  If you lease, MSD is the way to go, period. There are no excuses. The lower payment is just a side benefit."
720,"June  3, 2016  4:04AM",flightnurse,"When it comes to transmissions the Premium A4 get's the CVT, if you move up to the Premium Plus and Prestige they get the DSG. I just wish Audi would move to a RWD platform."

723,"June  3, 2016  4:40AM",flightnurse," I'm going out on a limb and saw that that isn't correct, every 2017 A4 that North Scottsdale Audi has, has a CVT transmission, the salesmen said that the Premium gets the CVT and the DSG on the other models."
724,"June  3, 2016  4:41AM",flightnurse," A lot of people aren't happy that the MT is on it's way out, but the current crop of DSG and Auto transmissions really make it hard for people not to agree, I love the 8 spd in our BMW's"
725,"June  3, 2016  5:48AM",andres3,"DSG might not have the smoothest of shifting characteristics, particularly at low or stopping speed, but when you can bang out consistent 4-1/2 second OR LESS 0-60 sprints in part due to the brilliant ""launch control"" features of the DSG, how can one honestly complain?"
726,"June  3, 2016  1:43PM",roadburner,"I'm coming around to the opinion that a manual tends to be more entertaining when the car actually needs a manual gearbox. For example, my 318ti(with a Turner Motorsports Conforti chip) makes around 140 lb-ft of torque at 4500 rpm. You simply must keep the engine wound tight to make anything close to rapid progress- and it's a lot of fun to drive it in that fashion. In contrast, my M235i makes 330 lb-ft of twist from 1300 to 4500 rpm; with such a flat torque curve there is almost always a ton of thrust available regardless of rpm and/or the gear selected. It's also nice to have a car that can convert from cruise mode to track toy mode with the press of a button. If I was buying an M2 or M3 I would definitely go with a manual every time, but in the less intense models an automatic transmission does not detract from my enjoyment of the car- but then at 59 I'm fast approaching geezer status."

They had 650i GC, 550i sedan, 4289GC, X1,X3, X5 40e (plug in) they also has a 340i sedan that was a rolling catalog for the M Sport performance parts. I drove only 4 of them, the 650, 550, X5 and X1. First time driving the 650iGC and I loved it, It handled well, was roomy and it didn't look like a typical sedan, it was fully load, M Sport, Executive package, B&O radio and a couple of other options (don't remember what they were) but the TT V8 is a monster, and I would get tickets in it, the 550 was equipped pretty much the same way and I wasn't that happy with it felt bigger and disconnected but then again the TTV8! The X5 40e was a complete surprise it was comfortable to drive, you have a very commanding view of the road, the power train was great never did I feel being between pure elec and gas engine, the 2L gas engine was peppy enough to move the big X5 without much problem, very refined.. The X1 was a big disappointment but after thinking about it for a couple of day, there was no way the X1 was going to impress me or Rick after driving the other 3 cars, the X1 feels like a much lower price car, lots of road noise and tire noise, the ride was bouncey and never felt planted. plus it was much smaller then I thought it was going to be.  Rick drove the 428GC that was loaded with M Sport and couple of other packages and really liked how it drove, but he did like the 650GC too.  Spoke to a CA and we took out a 640iGC and really liked how that one drove, yeah it's down on power, but the planted feel and comfortable but firm ride was still there.

775,"June  3, 2016 12:03AM",flightnurse,"So the test drive went well, just a little FYI, it was 110 today here in Sunny PHX...  So I test drove two A4's, but 2017, I drove a Premium Plus FWD with a CVT (only transmission that comes with FWD) and a Premium Plus Auto ( Quattro)  I have always liked the looks of the Audi's and their interiors have always been very clean (almost like someone from Denmark designed them) and minimalist at the same time. The size of the A4 is bigger then last Gen, so in comparison it's slight bigger then my 320, but the 3GT has more rear legroom.  I was surprised how well the CVT shifts, but there is still that rubber band feeling, the Auto in the Quattro was better, but not too sure if AWD is really needed here in the Desert. The 252 HP 2L has a lot of motivation, but our 3GT is quicker (it has the BMS stage 1) over all driving the car is drove well, both with CVT or Duel Clutch but I give the Dual Clutch the nod, pricing for the cars are very competitive, you can get a Premium Plus for about 46K fully loaded, very competitive with BMW and a 328i. Even in Quattro you can tell the car is based on FWD. Fit and Finish was first rate, and would give Audi a nod for the feel of the leather over both of our BWW's.  The size of the A4 felt just right not too bed or too small, I'm not too sure if an A6 is needed, plenty of rear leg room and head room, even behind the drivers seat once I adjusted the drivers seat to my liking. I sat in a 2017 S3 and found small and I can see the appeal to it."

No wonder I liked, but didn't love the '16 and older S3's. That being said the performance enthusiasts will be taking advantage of the new engine's stage 1 tunes coming in at about 350+ HP.

I like the old TL Type S which is still a great looking car close to 10 years out of production.  I like the 2009 - 2011 SH AWD models because of their aggressive looking rear end with tail pipes sticking out the back & squared off 5 Spoke Wheels.

On the Honda, it seemed you had to get the ""Touring"" model to get that, which got quite expensive. And, for what it's worth, the TLX may be conservative in its own right, but I think it's still more distinctive than an Accord.

The F-Pace is the same size as BMW's X5 and it under cut the X5 by 7K. This was the first time I had a chance to really look at Jaguar up close and the salesman was not pushy at all. The F pace comes in Diesel and Gas, beginning of June they get their first diesel F Pace, I can't wait to drive it.

Actually, car-wise, there have been good signs for Jag since the '04 XJ's all aluminum architecture (and Ford cash flow). Unfortunately, nobody noticed as it continued the XJ style of the '60s. Handsome, but been there, done that. The current lineup are all winners as vehicles that offer performance, style and quality. From my personal (and, of course a sample set of 1) experience build, reliability and materials are all excellent.  The XE and F-Pace early reviews are almost all big thumbs up. I'm torn, want Jag to survive and thrive, yet selfishly I hate to potentially lose the relative exclusivity of driving a Jag.  My 17 y.o. son believes I'm being selfish, that there's no reason for someone of my advanced years to be driving an XF, when it would so much better serve his purposes. The '02 RX300 he currently is lucky enough to drive would be much better suited to me. Gotta like the attitude, if not the logic!"

821,"May  8, 2016  3:33PM",flightnurse," BMW is selling cars do they don't have to do the free maintenance any longer, but Jag will have to do it for a while to get people to trust them, I'm hoping that Alfa does the same thing with their cars too. It's nice to know you wont have to pay for anything.."
822,"May  8, 2016  3:49PM",dino001," They do, but shortening the coverage will make them even more dependent on leases. I'm sure a good extension and certified preowned programs coukd bridge the gap. I just hate ""sneak"" price hikes, like changing the packaging, or cutting 0.2 inches of width from paper towel or toilet tissue rolls. I like straight talk and treatment, not slight of hand moves."
823,"May  8, 2016  4:05PM",sda," That would be sad as Olds was shut down. Doubt they would do that to Cadillac, but never say never."
824,"May  8, 2016  4:27PM",kyfdx," As much as those that really look at the math (like you and me) value the maintenance program, BMW decided that the marketing value of the plan didn't justify their increased costs. They are probably correct. Unfortunately."
825,"May  8, 2016  4:43PM",cdnpinhead,"Maybe BMW will go back to maintenance schedules that help the car last hundreds of thousands of miles, as long as they don't have to pay for it. I'm not holding my breath, however."
826,"May  8, 2016  4:56PM",stickguy,"not happening as long as they are paying for it.  but, nothing stopping you from changing the oil as often as you want to, on your dime!"
827,"May  8, 2016  5:11PM",Mr_Shiftright,Maybe BMW has confidence that their cars are now more reliable than they used to be?
828,"May  8, 2016  5:55PM",sandman_6472,"Saw a beautiful 328i, blue over beige, not sure the year but gorgeous. Having never owned a BMW, will definitely be looking for a CPO unit in a few years once I go into retirement again. By then, my driving should go down substantially so it'll be mostly around town stuff. Just wish they still made the 128 as I love the smaller size, anything from 170"" down is my preferred size now as it's usually me in the vehicle or me and the wife as the kids usually meet us in their own rides or we take a couple to our destination.  The Sandman"
829,"May  8, 2016  5:59PM",andres3," If I didn't know a great Indy Audi Shop then I might feel differently about the value of free maintenance. Also, if the car is totaled early in its life, I don't believe you get a penny for ""free maintenance"" back. So it could end up being worthless.  I think BMW found that a few too many non-badge buyers are driving the heck out of these cars, and M brakes are very expensive to service and replace (pads and rotors)."
830,"May  9, 2016  1:21AM",dino001," By cutting the warranty? I don't follow. Maintenance is one thing, but warranty is another."
831,"May  9, 2016 11:44AM",kyfdx, I hadn't heard that the warranty was being cut.... just the maintenance.
832,"May  9, 2016 12:55PM",dino001," I tried to corroborate and found a confirmation for the maintenance cut and couple of dealers listing new 2017 vehicles with 4/50 warranty and 3/36 maintenance. Looks, like I might have misunderstood. I thought Fligthnurse wrote about both warranty and maintenance being cut, but perhaps not."
833,"May 10, 2016  4:35PM",flightnurse," IT's not to take effect until MY17, Only the maintenance is being cut not the bumper to bumper warranty, however, I think the bumper to bumper warranty isn't transferable since My16."
834,"May 10, 2016  8:05PM",dino001," I think it's the maintenance that's not transferable. Warranty is - essentially all brands have warranty transferable, except there are some exceptions in Kia/Hyundai ""extensions"" in warranties beyond 3/36, but I don't know the details on those exceptions.  http://www.bmwusa.com/Standard/Content/bmwmaintenanceprogram.aspx?mobileoverride=true"
835,"May 10, 2016  8:16PM",graphicguy," Trying to remember what the maintenance items might be in that 4th year, but BMW saved themselves a ton of money. Probably cut out one brake replacement, an oil change, probably some AWD services, wipers, perhaps some other minor things. But, that 4th year would probably be the most expensive to cover than the previous 3 years combined."
836,"May 10, 2016  8:25PM",Michaell," And, given that a majority of BMWs are leased for 36 months, I don't think they are offending that segment of their customers by dropping the 4th year."
837,"May 10, 2016  9:21PM",kyfdx,"Not covering wear items at all, from what I understand, so no wipers or brake jobs. I've received brake jobs on at least one axle, on every BMW we've had.  If you lease 36/15, you are out of the maintenance plan for the last 7.5 months, if it drops to 3 yr, 36 K"
838,"May 10, 2016  9:44PM",dino001," That's why I'm so disappointed. 3/36 maintenance plans have generally low value, as they cover basic oil change and sometimes air filter. 4/50 plan run into a need of first major service, even on computer based. My brakes are still in good shape, which saved them a bundle (I'm out of 50k already), but many people needed them apparently. There may also be some more fluids to be changed, if your computer senses more severe driving condition.  Wipers are generally cheap, so not much value there, especially that there are some decent aftermarket wipers for $20 or so, but it seems like just pettiness from their part to cut that one. Whatever. I guess dealers can now charge those uninformed good money for their ""genuine"" wiper and even add ""installation fee"" for good 30 minutes of hard work of super-certified technician. BTW, this is not first time I see pettiness in their conduct. My navigation (it's older-generation, still hard disk based system) doesn't have a single automotive store (like AutoZone, etc.), or other brand dealerships in it. Just ridiculous, if you think about it.  I'll live, but I'm quite disappointed overall. Just confirms to me - there is no reason for any kind of loyalty. It's all ""what you have done for me lately"". It's OK, I'll do the same."

847,"May  4, 2016  6:44PM",roadburner,I don't know what Cadillac is going to do; they have a world class product but perception is taking much too long to catch up with reality...
848,"May  4, 2016  9:19PM",laurasdada,"Perhaps review their pricing model, study Lexus circa 1989..."
849,"May  4, 2016 10:16PM",roadburner, Exactly; they need to get butts in seats before they set prices as high as their competitors.
850,"May  5, 2016  1:25PM",dino001,"Cadillac is a tragic case of a complete mismatch between aspirations and reality on many different levels. It all starts with pricing not matching the current perception (whether the perception is correct or not, doesn't really matter at this time), production capacity and sales network. They want to be ""prestigous"", but their production capacity and especially dealer network is a legacy of their heyday well before German and Japanese brands took over that market.  I read that Detroit's problem has always been (across the board for all brands) inability to scale down production to match current demand, which in turn made them incentive addicts. They essentially make a car and then try to sell it. Others often have mindset that they won't make a car until they have some evidence it's actually needed somewhere. It can be a real order (customer's or dealer's - BMW operates that way), deep market studies, or simple case of matching cars that sold (Japanese reportedly do it that way). In other words - they want to (at least virtually) sell the car before making it. Detroit makes it first (because you know, union contracts, sales targets, etc.) and then find a customer for it. Any attempt of changing that mindset, while positive in general long term, requires willingness of taking short or even longer lasting intermediate pain of sales drops, production shutdowns and contract breaks with minor dealers.  For comparison, Tampa Bay (not including Sarasota) has 3 BMW, MB, 2 Audi and 2 Acura, 1 Jaguar store, and only 4 Cadillac stores, which doesn't sound bad. But extend the radius to just 50 miles and the picture changes dramatically: it adds about one dealer for Sarasota for all Germans, one store in Lakeland for BMW and MB, but Cadillac's network grows to 13 stores. Considering sales numbers and it is clearly nuts. May be convenient, but there is no pricing power. I'm sure those dealers are hurting, too. This of course quickly rolls downhill into contentious relationships with customers, as dealer that doesn't have any money will not support their customer.  Cadillac's management keeps wanting to have the cake and eat it. They want large sales, no incentives and high prestige - we all know that ain't gonna happen. You can pick two. They probably know it, too - but their stakeholders are too entrenched and simply unwilling to take the necessary real steps to fix it - they rather pretend doing something and then act surprised that things are not going as planned."
851,"May  5, 2016  2:11PM",nyccarguy,"The sad thing is that Cadillac HAS good products.  Between @graphicguy, @qbrozen, & @ab348 they've got some fans.  Believe me, if there was a problem with any of our posters' cars we'd know about it.  Even the fact that @graphicguy didn't flip his 2016 CTS in its 1st week speaks volumes about the product."
852,"May  5, 2016  2:31PM",dino001," It may be true, but the reality is people don't buy them in numbers produced and those who buy expect pricing below what Cadillac thinks they should pay. So either the cars stay on lots, or they move at prices below expected levels. Something's got to give. Mere wishing is not going to solve it - yet, so far that's all we see from them - trying to charm reality with corporate chants, not real moves."
853,"May  5, 2016  3:50PM",jpp5862," I completely agree, but they spent 30+ years destroying the brand, it won't recover overnight.  No one really wants a Cadillac, even if they do want a great driving car.  Edit: Let me rephrase, people who want a great driving car will buy a Cadillac. People who want a status symbol badge won't give Cadillac a second thought and most buyers fit the latter category."
854,"May  5, 2016  4:41PM",graphicguy, Lots of truth in your last paragraph!
855,"May  5, 2016  6:43PM",nyccarguy,"Well said @jpp5862.  To me, part of the allure of a Cadillac (besides the Escalade) is that they are not status symbols.  You don't see one on every corner.  I'm a car enthusiast.  I'm ashamed to say that when @qbrozen announced that he bought his CTS V-Sport, I had to look it up to find out.  I took a look at the specs and my eyes widened.  I was impressed to say the least.  As @roadburner says all the time, people wear many of the BMWs, MBs, & Audis on the road today.  The ATS looks like a nice car.  I built a Luxury model online with AWD, Upgraded Wheels (the black ones).  The sticker price shoots close to $50K very quickly (as it does on many entry level luxury performance sedans).  If GM is constantly throwing $10K rebates at these cars at the end of the year, why not lower the cost of entry to begin with?"
856,"May  5, 2016  6:47PM",qbrozen,"couldn't agree more. No idea why they just don't lower their prices. I mean, rather than try to get 10k people to pay $2k under and 25k people to pay $10k under, just lower them $5k and kill the rebates and advertise the hell out of the fact that you trump the others in comparison tests AND undercut their prices. You lose $270k with the first scenario but have nothing to crow about vs $175k in scenario 2 with a great selling point."
857,"May  5, 2016  7:27PM",dino001," Simple - there is always a hope for a sucker who will pay more. Moreover, there is also fear that lowering the price won't help - people will still ask for further discount. Not to mention 5k is probably more than their profit margin on first production year, perhaps even longer. Last - they still think ""It's a Cadillac"" means, the sticker has to be high, cause you know, it meant that 30 years ago."
858,"May  5, 2016  8:47PM",flightnurse," CG what has happened with your CTS? Had Caddy made good on fixing it?  Now I like the CTS, but I really think Caddy needs to stop with these half size cars. The ATS is a 3 series fighter, but it's smaller on the inside. The CTS is a 5 series fighter however, it's is smaller inside, and slight larger then a 3 series. I would assume if they want to compete with the 3 and 5 series they need to be competitive on all fronts. For my next car I'm leaning towards the new 5 series, but will look at the A6 and E class, but the CTS isn't on my list until it competitive in the interior space like the other cars."
859,"May  5, 2016  9:35PM",graphicguy,"FN...Cadillac took the '14 CTS back. I was still PO'd but they gave me a new '16 and some pocket money for my troubles. '16 is what the '14 should have been. CTS came out of the blocks about 18 months before it was fully baked, at least in my case.  '16 has been perfect. These new Caddys are really nice cars. They're built well. They use very nice materials in them, they look great, and they perform and handle great. But, that's not what people want from Caddy. They want the Caddy that's in the Escalade.  Not sure I'll buy another, but so far, I'm loving the '16 version.  But, as others point out, it's not enough to build a really good car. Perception is what makes people pony up. Funny, people are willing to buy the most expensive Cadillac, but it's the poorest performer. Again, perception.....  The best Cadillacs are the ATS and the CTS, but people are avoiding them. I know resale is terrible, but I bought my CTS for what a cheaper 3 series or C300 would cost. But, it's as good, and in many respects better, than the E Class or 5 Series.  I saw an M235i convertible at the car show this past winter. If I had my check book with me, I would have bought it on the spot. Luckily, my rational angel replaced my demon by the time I left the car show."

If Cadillac hadn't come through in replacing my lemon, that's what would be sitting in the GG estate right now.  Beautiful car that drives surprisingly well.  As you say, not as spacious as a 5, E or A6, but about the interior space of the CTS, which is really more than I need anyway."
862,"May  6, 2016  3:27PM",Mr_Shiftright,"  As most of you are tired of hearing me saying , Cadillac remain relatively stagnant until everyone who bought one in the 1980s is dead. We have about another ten years, if Cadillac can chug along until then.  Another problem, aside from the dubious reputation of the past tarnishing their quite good products of the present, is, as you have all mentioned, unrealistic pricing. This seems to keep their sales figures firmly rooted to the same numbers, year after year.  And say, where's Jaguar? I'm actually quite worried about that company. Let's hope jumping into the SUV market will save them---if that flops, I think you can kiss them goodbye. They are only at 25% of their 2002 U,S, sales figures.  Cadillac, on the other hand, has been pretty consistent, hovering in the 200,000 range per year since 2002. They seem to be on a 175,000 pace for 2016. So, same-o, same-o for Cadillac.  Volvo is at about 70% of its 2002 numbers, and seem to be on an upswing of sorts."
863,"May  6, 2016  5:04PM",stickguy,"If I get a jag, will definitely be a lease, so they only need to survive 4 years more from now!  Volvo, I think they stay. New owners will want to keep the US market in place. New product us helping."
864,"May  6, 2016  5:40PM",qbrozen," Where in the interior do you find it lacking? Just doing a quick comparo online, the CTS has 4.4"" more front legroom than the E and 4.3"" more than the 5. It falls right in the middle with rear legroom at only 0.4"" less than the E but 0.1"" more than the 5."
865,"May  6, 2016  5:48PM",laurasdada,"The Jag F-Pace, like the XE, is getting very good early press. Automobile Mag (online, at least) has a ""first and second"" drive impression articles, they're still looking for faults.  While the XE is a handsome, muscular looking beast, I really wish they had gone away from the Germans sedan styling theme of same sausage, different lengths. But, along with the F-Pace, as their likely bread and butter models, can't start too out there, I guess.  My XF, still flawless at 29+ months and ~26k miles.

877,"March 25, 2016  8:12PM",Michaell,"@flightnurse - good point. They mention the 7 MSDs but not the starting MF from which they are deducted.  .00135 is the base MF this month, but the dealer can mark it up to .00175."
878,"March 26, 2016  3:35PM",Mr_Shiftright,You're also losing one month's lease payment in the investment interest you would lose on giving them $3850 of your money for 3 years.

881,"April  1, 2016 12:00AM",flightnurse," One thing people don't get with MSD's is over the life of the lease, you are saving on average about $1900 plus you get the MSD's back when you turn the car"
882,"April  1, 2016  2:40AM",Mr_Shiftright," Yeah but the dealer can jack up the MF, and if they do that to the max as Michael points out, that's one whole 1% more interest; and those 7 payments are held hostage against any damage (read the fine print) --not a great position for negotiation at turn-in.  But your point is well-taken nonetheless and should be considered along with everything else."
883,"April  1, 2016  2:45AM",stickguy,"that was something I wondered about with the MSDs. On my lease, there is no security deposit, so if they want to ding me for damage, they have to ask for it and I can argue. But if they have $3,500 ""on account"", they can keep whatever they want, and I would have to fight them to get it back."
884,"April  1, 2016  2:46AM",Mr_Shiftright,EGG-xactly my concern as well.
885,"April  1, 2016  3:10AM",flightnurse,"  This can happen and does at any dealership, but this is why the savvy buyer would investigate what the current MF is and call the dealer on the increase."
886,"April  1, 2016  3:11AM",flightnurse," From what I have read on Bimmerfest, BMW has not done this since the MSD is not really a ""security"" deposit in the general term, but a way to lower the MF."
887,"April  1, 2016  3:19AM",Mr_Shiftright,Depends on what's in the contract--it should state (or not) whether the MSD can be used against damages at turn-in.
888,"April  1, 2016 10:51AM",kyfdx," I agree with the thought process on this... It's the same reason I don't use a debit card. But, in reality, all cars get an inspection at your home/business, and a printout is given to you then (3-4 weeks before turn-in). You owe what you owe, regardless of deposit.  I've done it twice, and no issues."
889,"April  1, 2016  3:19PM",Mr_Shiftright,"True enough but there are shades of gray as to what represents ""significant damage"". I've also heard of cases where one inspection seeeds rather perfunctory, and another very detailed. Go figure."
890,"April  1, 2016  3:30PM",kyfdx,"I haven't run into that. Twice was with MSDs, but I've turned in at least 8-10 leased cars, with never an issue.  I've heard plenty of stories, though. I also know that plenty of people treat their vehicles like crap, and probably aren't good candidates for leasing.."
891,"April  1, 2016  3:44PM",flightnurse," I was going to post something like this, I would suspect that it all depends on how much reconditioning your car needs, if you take care of your car and it's just normal wear and tear, then it's not an issue, but if you don't care how many stains there are inside or scraps and dents and road rash on the rims, then I get could see BMW holding back some money."
892,"April  7, 2016  6:09PM",tlong,"I had a rented A3 sedan this past week. I have to say I was a bit underwhelmed. While I realize it was probably a base model, the interior, while nice, had quite a bit of hard door plastics, etc. IMHO the dash looks kind of cheap with the worst part being the round air vents. The driving feel was ok but not great. The engine (I assume it was a Turbo 4?) was somewhat harsh at idle but had good power upon acceleration. The leather seats were decent and the car looks attractive.  Compared to my 1998 A4 that was about the same size, the older A4 was way nicer thank the A3 IMHO."
893,"April  7, 2016  6:14PM",andres3," Can't argue with you that it seems Audi finally took some cost cut measures when making the current generation A3's interior. I love the round air vents though, that's our only disagreement. The driving feel; did you toss it around?, feels like a very light and lively chassis to me. The 1.8T I'm not a fan of; the 2.0T should be standard, better power, and better fuel economy at the same time. Before someone argues, note the 2.0T adds quattro without losing MPG, that's better efficiency by a large margin. The 2.0T is a stellar engine."
894,"April  7, 2016  6:49PM",tlong,"I couldn't toss it as I pretty much drove the freeways. Also my rental seemed to bottom out the front right shock as if there was no damping - it was a huge chunk on speedbumps, etc. So I had to baby it a bit - but the car had 18K miles on it so don't know how that had happened. I reported it to the rental company upon return."

Had less cash to spend and wanted the versatility of a hatch to haul stuff. So far, only one issue with a starter wire that took a few days to find malfunctioning.

902,"February 14, 2016  4:48AM",roadburner,"Those of you who don't follow the Cars & Conversation or Chronic Car Buyers topics might be interested to know that I picked up a CPO 2014 M235i about two weeks ago. My wife insisted that I check it out; I originally intended to drive it first and then drive a couple of new Mustang GTs in the same general area. As it turned out I ended up making a deal then and there.  I was honestly surprised at how good it was. The car is about the same size as an E36, which suits me perfectly(a main sticking point on the Mustang was its size). It has just about every option save the the Helen Keller Package(Blind Spot Monitoring, Lane Departure warning, etc.). It's also an automatic, but being the Sport derivation of the ZF HP8 I can live with it(in any event, I still have the Club Sport and Wrangler to keep my left foot in practice).  What do I like? The transmission actually does what I want it to do in Sport+/Manual mode- every other BMW automatic I have driven has tried to second-guess me- including the B7 press loaner I tested a while back. Think: electronic full manual valve body, for any older drag racers out there. Durability should be decent as the M235i Racing gets essentially the same transmission, albeit with more aggressive software.  The Adaptive M Suspension literally transforms the car when you toggle into Sport or Sport+. It's almost like two different cars. I've never driven a BMW where the EDC or AMS made such a huge difference.  The standard M Performance Power Kit really eliminates the turbo lag; with 330 lb-ft of torque available from 1300 rpm it almost feels like some of the big block Chevys I drove in my misspent street racing youth. Fuel economy is hovering around 25 mpg, which is more than good enough for me.  Michelin PSS in a staggered setup are standard. No run flats!  The sports seats with adjustable bolsters are excellent as expected. It's no wonder that BMW NA is making them standard fitment in many US models; the base seats in newer BMW are only good for generating business for chiropractors.  The H-K audio is good enough that I don't feel like I have to tweak it right away.  Dislikes? The steering could use a bit more feel. That said, the effort and ratio(s)-Variable Sport Steering is standard-is very good.  I agree with Bob Harper fromBMW CAR : the IP needs oil and water temperature gauges instead of the ""///M 235i"" graphic that illuminates as soon as you open the driver's door  The brakes are great but the pedal feel is somewhat wooden.  No LSD. I will definitely have to add one sooner than later; at half throttle it will light up the rear tires in Comfort mode with DSC fully enabled.  Track time will have to wait a few months. The 2ers first outing will be at Putnam Park- which is my ""home"" track. I'm too old to attempt to learn a car and a track at the same time. It will also see at least one night at the local 1/8th mile strip- might as well test the Launch Control...  A couple of people asked me to compare it to the E30 M3; the 2er is not as light on its feet and it lacks the ""hard-wired to the synapses"" experience of the original M3. However, it is very comparable to the E46 M3 in terms of handling and braking. Power in contrast, is more akin to that of the E9x M3 at least from a usability standpoint on public roads. In any event, I can easily see keeping this car for a decade or more. Who knows when/if Munich will build anything RWD in this size class again?  So... Is it worthy of an ///M badge? I'd say it's closer to an ""is,"" but that said, most everyone has forgotten that the first M car based on a production model was the E12 M535i- which boasted the M30 3.5 motor from the E24 635i along with an upgraded suspension, an M body kit, and aggressively bolstered front seats. Sound familiar?"
903,"February 14, 2016  7:55AM",flightnurse,"Congrates on the new M235, When the new M2 arrives in the next month or two, that will be worthy of the M badge.. Regarding the M Adaptive Suspension, I was really taken how it transforms the car when you toggle from C to S. It's like having two cars..."
904,"February 14, 2016 11:45PM",roadburner,"I liked the M2, but it wasn't within my current budget. That said, at the M2's price point the GT350 is a compelling alternative. I'd have to spend considerable seat time in both to make the call."
905,"February 15, 2016  4:11AM",flightnurse," Having just driven a M3, Mustang GT and GT350 back to back, I give it to the GT350, for me it hits all the right points. Plus the sound that V8 makes is erotic (to me.) When I'm ready for next car it's going to be tough to choose."
906,"February 15, 2016  2:11PM",nyccarguy,"@flightnurse - I'd also go with the GT350 at the price point.  I know that you & Rick have no issues custom ordering & waiting for your BMWs, but it is not too hard to get an ///M3 or ///M4 into the $75K us atmosphere."
907,"February 15, 2016  2:52PM",roadburner,"A major selling point for the GT350 is the flat plane V8- it's significantly different from the Mustang GT engine. As for as price goes, the GT350 has the edge on paper; the trick is finding a dealer that actually has a car to sell- and isn't tacking on a $25k ADM sticker..."
908,"February 15, 2016  3:27PM",nyccarguy,"I can't stand ADM stickers, but there are morons who pay them so who am I to judge?  I actually know 2 people who paid them.   One guy bought a 2007 Shelby GT500 for $20K over sticker.  He put the $20K down, then paid off the rest of the car over 5 years.  He maybe put 5K miles on it.  Traded it in a year after it was paid off for a new Jaguar FType R coupe.  Another guy I know paid $10K over sticker for an '09 Challenger SRT8.  He got rid of it maybe 4 years later with less than 10K miles."
909,"February 15, 2016  4:39PM",Mr_Shiftright,"So he paid what? Maybe $60K?...and 9 years later it's worth 1/2 that---not too bad, really, even with the ADM."
910,"February 15, 2016  7:01PM",nyccarguy, The guy with the Shelby? I guess not.  My friend with the Challenger got slaughtered though. To him it doesn't matter. They've got a tree in the back yard.
911,"February 16, 2016  1:05AM",flightnurse," You can order a M3/M4 that comes in under the 65K mark, the only option I would get on them is M Adapative Suspension, for 1K that is it. But the GT350 fully loaded in far less then that. When it comes to the ADM well just wait, that will go away too."
912,"February 16, 2016  7:20PM",andres3,"  Okay, need a legend here. What does EDC and AMS stand for?  Have you had enough seat time in other recent model sporty cars to judge other ""adaptive"" suspensions with the M235i? I didn't notice hardly any change in a Lexus IS350 for example, and it had 4 different settings! The S3 only has 2 truly different settings; definitely noticeable. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's a different car, but even in a short test drive, it was a good difference. If these adaptive suspensions don't add significant weight; I'd say they are definitely worth it as a Win Win."
913,"February 16, 2016  8:05PM",roadburner," Sorry! EDC= Electronic Damper Control AMS= Adaptive M Suspension Very similar similar systems that use various sensors and switch settings to modify jounce and rebound settings on the shocks. The GM's magnetorheological suspensions are more sophisticated and versatile, but I haven't had much experience with them. I haven't driven that many cars with adjustable damping aside from BMWs, and the M235i system makes the most noticeable difference that I've experienced."
914,"February 17, 2016 11:46PM",andys120,"Congratulations, Roadburner on your new M235i. An M235i convertible is at the top of my wish list and I think, like you, I'll like the size performance and features. The resemblance to the great E46 doesn't hurt either. Like you I've given some thought to various Mustangs but they're just to big for me. I wonder if they've improved the weight distribution. My '86 5 liter convertible was as front heavy as an unloaded pickup.  How long do you suppose it'll be before used M235s are in the $30K bracket?"

918,"February 18, 2016  8:24PM",andres3,"I had to take in my S4 for its first warranty replacement part at 42K+ miles yesterday. The right headlight low beam bulb ""burned out/broke."" Indicator light was very specific about problem with the right side headlight low beam bulb. Audi covered it, although there was a mention that sometimes they might like to wiggle out of paying for bulbs.  I just said no owner would expect to have to replace bulbs in under 4 years or 50K miles. They didn't try and charge me; said it was a $300 bulb.  This was the headlight that was replaced by a body shop; so not original. I""m going to go with not a coincidence, and blame it on the body shop/accident rather than Audi. That's how I'm chalking this one up, and appreciate Audi covering it without making me deal with the hassle of going back to a lousy shop. I do realize the shop used an Audi derived OEM replacement part, but I have my reasons.  Isn't this 2 indicator errors in 2016 alone for me? First windshield washer fluid issue, now a burned/broken bulb. When is Audi going to learn how to make a car :P LOL.  Maybe this is a sign I should join Chronic Car Buyer's Anonymous before a 3rd indicator error light comes on (besides low fuel)."
919,"February 19, 2016  3:37AM",roadburner," I hate dealing with most body shops; if the car looks good from 20 feet away the average customer is ecstatic- and as a result, the work really suffers. Maybe I've just been lucky, but when I creased the side of my ti I took it to my local dealer's BMW Certified Collision Repair Center. The quality of the work was outstanding, and I had absolutely no complaints. Was the body shop that ""repaired"" your car an Audi certified shop?"
920,"February 19, 2016  9:34PM",andres3," Yes, they were certified, and there's only 3 in all of San Diego County! However, they were so horrible, I imagine a typical decent body shop would probably out-perform them, though I haven't had luck with any body shops in San Diego County yet (tried 4 different ones now).  I did tell Audi that they need to immediately de-certify them. They used to have a good reputation locally in Escondido (by San Diego), but they got bought out by Caliber Collision (the McDonald's of Body Shops) years ago. They kept the old name along with Caliber Collision to fool people, and they still are certified by Audi to this day despite my complaints.  I agree with you, they get away with shoddy workmanship because most people won't take their car back 3 times until they get it right like I did."
921,"March 10, 2016  2:38AM",sweendogy,@andres3 I really feel for the story- last month my neighbor backed into the front quarter of my car. Damage just to the one panel (I hope)- I have been waiting on getting the car fixed- may wait another 6 months or so as my hope is to have it fixed correctly and then quickly trade in for the next model s4 which I'm guessing will be available at that time. The tale of issues you have had with your car would have driven me to roll it off a cliff.
922,"March 10, 2016  6:52PM",andres3,"I would pay extra for a policy that has ""new car replacement"" even if your car isn't totaled, but has more than a 20% of value damage claim. I'd also pay extra to have a collision deductible waiver that applies to both uninsured and under insured drivers hitting you. Unfortunately in CA at least, it's better to be hit by an uninsured than a under insured driver."
923,"March 16, 2016  3:56PM",roadburner,"Those of you who own a car fitted with a ZF automatic or double-clutch transmission might be interested in this ZF List of approved lubricants. Page 3 lists the approved oils for double-clutch boxes while page 4 lists the proper ATF for the automatics- in both cases the part numbers for the oils as sold by the vehicle manufacturer are also provided.  Automatic owners should note on page 5 that ZF recommends an ATF change every 60,000-120,000 km(50,000-75,000 miles) or 8 years under the following conditions:  - frequent highway driving in top speed range, - offensive, sporty driving style, - frequent trailer operation,  I plan to change the ATF in the 2er every 50,000 miles, primarily because it will be my track toy for the next several years. Otherwise I would go with the 75,000 mile interval. I tend to be proactive with respect to vehicle maintenance and I believe it pays off; I've had the ATF changed in the GM A5S 390R(5L40E) in my '04 X3 2.5i every 60k miles.

Excellent interior, and I like the way it looks. That is also on my short list for next car in a 1.5 years (and yes, probably slightly used). Though unlike many of you here, I would get the FWD 4 cyl. version. Plenty of scoot for me, and lighter on it's feet, plus cheaper and better MPG."
933,"January 16, 2016  2:56PM",nyccarguy,"@stickguy - I know the CVT has its critics.  Rightfully so. One that's not properly designed or engineered could be disastrous.  I do business with a guy who had one replaced on a Jeep Compass twice.  Once on Chrysler's dime @ 60K, then again on his credit card @ 120K.  It is part of the reason I bought the 100K extended warranty for my Legacy.  Living with the CVT for 16 months and a little over 25K miles, I'm pretty impressed with it.  Those who don't know (the wife) think it is a traditional automatic transmission (plus I'd get the eye roll if I tried to explain otherwise).  It is very linear & smooth.  It doesn't drone as some reviews suggest (trust me, I'd know).  It also makes the most of my Legacy's meager 175 hp.  A CVT wouldn't deter me from a WRX"

952,"February  6, 2016  8:19PM",roadburner,One of the main reasons that I have not strayed too far from BMW is the fact that my dealer has an excellent service department and doesn't try to push unnecessary work. I also get a 20% discount on both parts and labor.
953,"February  6, 2016  8:27PM",tlong,           $60 in 1975 is about $270 today   ...but not $1100 as the OP mentioned. Also the kinds of services included in that price are probably less labor than the service from the 1970's.
954,"February  6, 2016  9:02PM",stickguy,"at the car show, my son did sit in the S3 again (bright red). He still loves those, but knows it is out of scope still. he has that as his ""next car"" still, with next car being the next one after the one he gets a year from now!"

956,"February  7, 2016 12:02AM",stickguy,I think I read that they were doing a refresh on the 50 for 2016 (or 2017 now?)  did sit in the TLX again today. a really nice car. Super comfy seats. Really need to drive one eventually.
957,"February  7, 2016 10:35PM",graphicguy," Still love the TLX. Really good cars, regardless of which measuring stick you use. It's just not tops in any single category....except maybe bang for the buck!"
958,"February  7, 2016 11:22PM",flightnurse,"Greetings from sunny Phoenix.. Well the Auction week's are over here and what a event. The Barrett Jackson event is mind blowing on what they have. Here is a link to the top 25 cars sold at all of the auctions that happen, some of the most beautiful cars ever built. While we were there we meet a gentlemen who was in charge of getting the cars on stage, Rick and I will be drivers next year, very much looking forward to this. The process starts next month.

959,"February  7, 2016 11:24PM",stickguy,"for a LT relationship, a well-rounded performer with rock solid reliability is not a bad thing to have. Likely better than one that ""wows"" in one area but comes with a lot of other compromises that can wear on you after a while?  Maybe the difference between dating a wildcat (leasing) and marrying to grow old with (buy and keep for 10 years)?"
960,"December 21, 2015  4:49PM",andres3,"Yes, I much rely on one car to do it all, and I can't have breakdowns. I don't have the time or money or patience. My S4 was fixed same day I took it in; the leaky windshield washer fluid tank was actually a hose that came off of the headlight washer system that attaches to the tank. Can I blame this on the body shop or Audi? I think 90% chance the body shop is to blame since the leak was by the front of the car, 10% chance Audi should have made the hoses with better clamps.  Fortunately, I'm able to drive without windshield washer fluid, and the tank must have a 1/3 or 1/4 reserve below the hose lines so it still worked, was just low soon after using it a few times (tripping a warning light)."
961,"December 21, 2015  4:55PM",Mr_Shiftright,"Well that 80K marker doesn't mean something outright fails. It means it has become substandard. Many many people drive around quite contentedly with cars, that if subjected to inspection, could justify quite a few repairs. At 80K for instance, your car's struts still work fine, but they aren't anywhere as good as new, and a worn ball joint wouldn't exhibit any difference to the driver. Nor would mushy motor mounts, glazed fan belts, or cracked exhaust hangers."
962,"December 21, 2015  6:55PM",m6user,"That 80k mark was probably correct up to about twenty years. Since the late 90s it seems that has stretched another 30k or so. Heck, back in 60s and 70s you started having major repairs by 70k and a car over 100k was worth next to nothing."
963,"December 21, 2015  9:00PM",stickguy,"@tlong, sounds like my (now gone)2000 TL. Had some stuff around 140k (struts, tires, motor mount). Then nothing really for about 4 years up to 175k, then a few breakdowns in rapid succession, just before my son graduated (he had it at college). Rear window motor failed, coil packs died, alternator crapped out. He got good at calling AAA. Plus one HID got wonky. That was a painful year of supporting old car long distance! Thankfully never broke down in transit."
964,"December 21, 2015  9:34PM",Mr_Shiftright,"Yeah, I would expect a new-ish car to still be in pretty good shape at 80K. But parts do wear. Maybe the glove box door is as good at 80K as it was when new but parts that go round and round and up and down have to show wear at 80K. And don't forget the psychological barrier of 99.9K miles and how that affects resale value. I think there is a mileage or number in people's heads as to when a car is ready for repairs. Not sure what that number is, but 99,999 sounds about right."
965,"December 22, 2015 12:43AM",flightnurse,I have a co-worker who has a first year new Gen camero with 145K miles on it and no major repairs on it. Of course I told him now that he spoke about it openly he will have problems now with it.
966,"December 22, 2015  5:04PM",Mr_Shiftright,I bet we could find some
967,"December 23, 2015  1:42PM",graphicguy," Perhaps some of that comes from having to replace serpentine belts, timing belts, etc at or near the 100K mile mark?"
968,"December 23, 2015  5:02PM",Mr_Shiftright,"Yes I think that's exactly right---usually 100K, or 90K, or maybe 105K, is a big service and many people skip out before having to do that. Also it's not unusual to need tires and brakes at that mileage, which are normal wear items. I mean, how many sellers would do ALL those things and then sell the car?"
969,"December 23, 2015  6:00PM",roadburner,"Well, at the 182,370 mile Oil Service my son's X3 also needed two serpentine belts as well as rear pads and rotors. Oh the horror!!!"
970,"December 23, 2015  6:08PM",Mr_Shiftright,"Yeah, but not everyone with a miled up X3 has a knowledgeable dad to fix everything, nor do they have your good luck. Remember, risk assessment is based on an actuarial. If you just interviewed 100 year old men you'd never predict actual life expectancy."
971,"December 23, 2015  6:24PM",roadburner,I don't think it's good luck- it's conscientious and consistent maintenance.
972,"December 23, 2015  6:29PM",Mr_Shiftright,"And that too! Of course, for that to really work it helps to buy the car new. I'm also conscientious but I've had to pay for the previous owner's neglect sometimes....or worse yet, for the factory's engineering gaffs."
973,"December 23, 2015  9:00PM",roadburner,"Well, the X3 was practically new; it had 16,500 miles on it and was just over a year old. You are absolutely right about prior owners; they can either enhance the reliability or ""poison the pond"" as it were."
974,"December 24, 2015 12:50AM",flightnurse," This is why getting a CPO BMW or any other brand that offers free maintenance is usually a good bet, since the new owner doesn't pay for service and can be in and out of a service department in about 15 minutes."
975,"December 25, 2015  2:17AM",sandman_6472,"Am thinking that a CPO luxury level vehicle is the best way to buy one used since the company's have a certain check list of things that must be done besides an oil change and tire rotation. Personally, I'd have more confidence in purchasing a vehicle that has been CPO'd than one that hasn't and would be willing to pay a slight premium for it just knowing the odds are in my favor for a more pleasant ownership experience. One thing about the folks who frequent these forums, we all seem to have a passion for our vehicles, that passion that makes us want to take better care of our vehicles and keep them in tip top shape. Our vehicles are more than an appliance to us, they are an extension of us silly as that may seem. Our ownership of them brings us great joy which leads us to take better are of them by cleaning them more often and doing he required maintenance.

980,"January 12, 2016  2:15AM",sweendogy,"@sandman_6472 while not lux CPO related my wife bought a CPO Honda CR-V in 2010. Car had very low miles 15k, ex-l with nav and was Honda certified. I bought the car sight unseen 200 miles away and picked it up- we had it for a month and it mostly sat (less then 300 miles, so 100 miles minus the pickup) until we were planning a big east coast trip of 1200 so I decided to look under the hood and noticed the oil level was low- also noticed a leak- looked around one tire was a little low- started looking at structural stuff noticed some gaps larger then others on the front end- then found a piece in the engine bay -and googled the serial number which I found to be a lower piece of the bumper.( or older bumper) - took car on a Sunday to my local Honda dealer (huge chain) and had the service manager who also is a certified Honda tech and asked if this car should of been certified- and he pointed out 10 issues including major front end damage that would have disqualified this car from such CPO status - I was lucky he was willing to put this in writing and making my case with both Honda and the selling dealer easier in getting compensation. Net net - you don't always get a certified car- BUT if you go to a honest bigger dealer (and go lux) you have a better chance of getting that peach. I bot a 8 month old s4 2 years ago - non CPO- got a good deal and have had no issues(knock on wood) sorry about long post."
981,"January 12, 2016  2:20AM",stickguy,"one good thing about the luxo brands is the nice long warranty. the dealer I have been keeping an eye on has had a number of 2 MY (even some 1 MY) used models, so we are talking 2-3 years elapsed max. So 1-2 years BtoB + another 2 years powertrain left on it. So while not certified, still plenty of coverage in case of any bugs it might have when you buy it."
982,"January 12, 2016  4:49AM",roadburner,A CPO car is only as good as the certifying dealer; I've bought 3 CPO cars from my local BMW dealer and they were all in excellent shape.
983,"January 16, 2016 12:53AM",sweendogy,@roadburner totally agree
984,"January 16, 2016  3:05AM",sandman_6472,"I plan to look at Audi, MB and BMW next time and go the CPO route to insure a vehicle that should last a good amount of time. Will pounce on our A3 if she decides to get something else though as her mileage will be pretty low in a few years. If not, leaning towards BMW to see what the fuss is about. Sat in a new Civic and liked the ergonomics and all. Will be interesting to drive one and see how much it's improved since my 2006 LX. Besides the HR-V, nothing else in their lineup moves me in any way. Felt like I've done that already.  The Sandman"
985,"January 16, 2016  4:17AM",roadburner," IMNSHO, your only sure bet to get a newer BMW that actually drives-at least a little-like a traditional BMW is to find a Sport/M Sport 2 Series, 3 Series, or 4 Series."
986,"January 16, 2016  4:33AM",nyccarguy,"I just got back from filling up my wife's Pilot to the tune of 14 mpg. At the gas station I saw a guy pull up in an A3. Black on Black. Caught my eye enough to come home & build one on the Audi website. 2.0T Quattro Premium (AWD, Pano Roof, 6 Speed STronic) with optional hot seats & sport suspension. Nice package for a $34,950 sticker price. 220 hp / 258 lb ft torque"

988,"January 16, 2016  5:20AM",nyccarguy,"@stickguy - that A4 is nice, but I think the 2013s & up are facelifted to modernize the look just a little bit more. I wouldn't touch an Audi without a 100K factory warranty. Which brings me to my next point, for less than the $34,950 sticker priced A3 I built I could head to Subaru and get a WRX Limited. I know it's not an Audi, but one thing I'm very happy with so far is Subaru's cost of ownership/maintenance. Plus I dig that functional hood scoop."
989,"January 16, 2016  1:32PM",stickguy,"one thing I would worry about, knowing some of the bombed out roads you drive on, is how tiring the ride/noise would get commuting in the WRX. Seems like a much better ""fun"" car to me!  Maybe just because I am getting old, but I appreciate comfort these days too. Though I did come darned close to getting that Civic Si last summer... Now that was a screaming deal."
990,"December 11, 2015 10:24PM",markcincinnati,Why would rear brakes be the first to go? Seems counter-intuitive.
991,"December 11, 2015 10:26PM",andres3,Ferodo Street Sport pads. Expensive? Yes. Worth it? Yes.
992,"December 12, 2015 12:53AM",roadburner, Exactly.
993,"December 12, 2015 12:55AM",Mr_Shiftright,"Geez, that's BMW 7-series money."
994,"December 12, 2015  4:58AM",stickguy,Honda's for some reason had a phase where the rears wore out much quicker than the front. I learned this when it happened to my Accord.
995,"December 12, 2015  1:51PM",nyccarguy," Happened in my (former) TSX & our Pilot as well. It doesn't make sense as the cars are platforms are FWD & the cars are nose heavy. One service adviser at a Honda dealer told me it is because they put rear brake pads ""the size of oreo cookies"" on the cars."
996,"December 12, 2015  1:54PM",sda," Are there other BMW dealers in your area? If not, sounds like a captive audience and little chance for getting another quote unless an independent shop does the work."
997,"December 12, 2015  1:59PM",sda," Same with my 06 Passat. Rear pads replaced around 50k, rotors left intact and didn't need resurfacing. Not sure this answer was correct but the service advisor told me there was more bias dialed to the rear brakes than in the past to take some of the stress off the front brakes. (?)"
998,"December 12, 2015  9:17PM",kyfdx," Yeah.. my dealer quoted around $600 just to do the rear brakes on my '06 model BMW. A lot of that is the OEM BMW rotors. Really, really pricy. I had my independent do the job with BMW pads and sensor, but with aftermarket rotors. Saved about half."
999,"December 12, 2015  9:18PM",kyfdx," It does seem that way, but typical for BMWs."
1000,"December 14, 2015  2:35PM",robr2," I've been told by techs that since front brakes do most of the work, the OEM brake pads on the rear are thinner. The goal is so that all four wheels reach replacement at the same time. The 2005 Passat I just traded had the rears done at 60K and all four were due to be done when I traded at 135K. I never did the fronts in that time.  I also just changed the rears on the my 2011 Explorer at just about 60K as well."
1001,"December 14, 2015  9:39PM",henryn,My 2008 Passat got new brakes on the rear at around 99k miles. The fronts were still good when I sold the car at around 105k.

1004,"December 18, 2015  2:52AM",sweendogy,I would also guess the rears would wear faster if you lived on a hill and used the parking break a lot - like my wife does. Maybe wrong on this but who knows - 30k miles and have to do rears hurts when you go to a Honda dealer. Glamor shot time 
1005,"December 18, 2015  4:22AM",nyccarguy,Nice shot!
1006,"December 18, 2015  4:34AM",stickguy,"read the review in one of this month's car magazines on the new A4. Sounded really nice. Interior though seemed pretty familiar, but I suspect the fancy new dashboard screen is cool."
1007,"December 18, 2015  9:01PM",breld,"With the increased hp on the 2.0t and the DSG trannie, the new A4 does seem very competitive."

1011,"December 20, 2015  6:30AM",roadburner,"My son brought his 2004 X3 2.5i home from college; it just turned over 182k miles. My wife has been letting him drive her E90 3er while he's home to keep excess miles off his truck. Funny thing; my wife and I both usually prefer light and nimble cars, yet we both like driving his sled more than her E90. I can't put my finger on why exactly- but there it is. Since he's had it at SC it has needed a new battery and a starter, but at that mileage I can't complain too much. The suspension is completely untouched; it's going to the dealer in a couple of days for an Oil Service so we will see if anything needs attention. Even if something does turn up I won't be that upset, as we bought it in 2005 and paid it off in 2007. It would take a lot of expensive repairs to equal eight years of lease or loan payments(over $46,000- based on the average U.S. monthly car payment of $483)."
1012,"December 20, 2015  2:59PM",stickguy,I did the nursing an old car along long distance once. Never again. Plus the thought of my daughter calling me to say she broke down along the side of the DC beltway is terrifying!
1013,"December 20, 2015  3:03PM",roadburner,"Haven't had to do any nursing as I see it; and aside froma bit of interior wear it looks and drives like a car with one-fourth the actual mileage.,"
1014,"December 20, 2015  4:14PM",Mr_Shiftright,"I think right around 80K, most cars are going to start to cost you money, or time, or both. At least potentially. Some people are luckier than others, or more conscientious, as the case may be. It REALLY helps when you own the car from new! "
1015,"December 20, 2015  4:29PM",m6user,"A lot of this is situational. If you have 5 vehicles there is always a spare if one if one or two aren't available. No long commutes or retired with time to spare. Most depend greatly on one car and don't have the time or want to hassle with repairs. It doesn't take a brain surgeon to understand that keeping a car for the very long term is cheaper. However, money is not the only or even the main factor for many especially those that buy luxury cars."
1016,"December 20, 2015  4:34PM",Mr_Shiftright,"Sure it's cheaper because you have amortized the depreciation, and even $150 a month in repairs is 1/2 or 1/3rd a lease or car payment.  But, when buying new, it's worth considering a particular model's historical reliability record."
1017,"December 20, 2015  5:57PM",m6user,Sure it is.....who wants to hassle with repairs whether it's covered by warranty or not. Number of recalls is also a factor. Sure it gets fixed for free but can be a hassle if not done during routine maintenence.
1018,"December 20, 2015  5:59PM",Mr_Shiftright,"And then there are the dreadful cases of the dealer being unable to fix the car, even under warranty, or it requiring numerous attempts."
1019,"December 21, 2015  4:47PM",tlong," My experiences don't match that - I usually don't find significant repair costs until around 120K, My Acura TL (2005) is at 155K right now and I had my first significant repair at around 130K, which was $1300 for some suspension work (control arms, etc.). And that has been about it other than the routine stuff. I also had a Jetta go to 143K, an Accord go way over 100K with no issues, and a Mercury Villager with the first big repair around 170K."

Some types of dynos would be easier to cheat on than others of course. Dynos, after all, are a major sales tool.  This issue comes up in other forums when complaints come in about certain dynos in certain shops reading suspiciously high, all the time, every time.

1026,"December  5, 2015  4:50PM",Mr_Shiftright,"I never implied anything of the sort with BMS. Advising people to research data from impartial sources rather than the manufacturer seems like good advice to me, whether it's ""lasts three times as long as leading deodorant"" or ""highest interest CD available today"". Consumer Reports built an empire on this very principle. If a manufacturer's claims are substantiated they are rewarded.  C'mon, you don't blindly accept every claim from every product. You check it out. You checked out BMS, I know you did.  Would I do a second dyno test after spending say $600 on a chip or re-flash or whatever. Sure I would.  This is also the method of coming to forums. We want to know other's experiences about entry-level performance cars. We want to read calibrated road tests. We want assurance that we're buying the real thing."

1032,"December  7, 2015  6:46PM",flightnurse,  I'm sure since the product is in beta testing we shall see more numbers to come.
1033,"December  7, 2015  6:52PM",Mr_Shiftright,"Swinging back to the topic of shopping entry level performance cars (but not forgetting what we were knocking about), I personally don't pay too much attention to numbers when shopping for a car. As many car enthusiasts know, there is a ""car's numbers"" and there's ""how a car performs in the real world"", and those two things can be very different."
1034,"December  7, 2015  8:59PM",graphicguy," Here...Here! So true.  I do remember when I put so much stock into 0-60 numbers from the car rags. That is, until I read an article (probably from C&D or R&D) that showed how they came up with those numbers. Usually, it was a get the revs up, drop the clutch, and try to keep it in a straight line, sort of ordeal. I don't drive like that (at least, not any more).  These days, I look at the entire package. Steering, handling, suspension's abilities to negotiate rough pavement without dancing...somewhere down the list is acceleration. Got to admit, even lux cars and mundane sedans are pretty darned quick these days."
1035,"December  7, 2015 10:18PM",roadburner,"I look at 0-100 and 50-70 in-gear times to get a good idea of the overall power and flexibility of the drivetrain. That and responsive handling(with fairly high limits) are non-negotiable. I strongly prefer RWD and three pedals, although I can be persuaded by a decent DCT/DSG; ditto for AWD that actually enhances high performance driving- see: STI and the S and RS edition Audis."
1036,"December  8, 2015 12:30AM",stickguy,"Consumers reports probably is the most representative of real world times. They drive like normal people. Light changes, hit the gas!  street start (rolling at 5 MPH) is also good indicator of flexibility. Exposes cars that need to have the snot revved out of them and clutch dumped to get moving.  40-80 is probably the best overall window of useful power application."
1037,"December  8, 2015  1:59AM",sweendogy,"General question...Has anyone had to do any repairs on these cars lately.? Brakes, tires anything non-oil change related. Reason for the ask wondering when I will have to go for brakes and dreading the potential cost. Knock on wood 27k miles not a gremlin to be found- also 430 mile round trip recently almost did a round tripper at 27mpg without a stop but wussed out as the gas light came on with over 2 gallons left. Any Color appreshaited"
1038,"December  8, 2015  5:07AM",nyccarguy,"@sweendogy - you should definitely research some independent shops in your area. I'm sure there are many that are more than qualified. For instance, the mechanic that works on my car. He gets OEM parts from the part manufacturer, not necesearily the auto manufacturer. Let's say Audi uses a certain sensor for the brakes. He'll get the sensor in the Bosch Box, not from Audi. His overhead is also much less than the gorgeous dealer with loaner cars, flat screen TVs, free WiFi, coffee...  Let's say the dealer wants to charge $1500 to do pads & rotors on all 4 corners, a solid independent shop might charge $800 or so."
1039,"December  8, 2015  7:06PM",Mr_Shiftright,I'd bet you could get that done at a very good indie shop for under $1000.
1040,"December  9, 2015  2:32PM",markcincinnati," Agree regarding finding a well qualified shop -- one that specializes in your brand, for these cars are breathtakingly expensive to maintain and repair after the OEM warranty/""free"" service period expires.  ONE factor in favor of the dealer -- and it may or may not impress you -- they (ours anyway) will do it right the first time and if not, make it right for no extra charge. That has not been my experience with the folks who don't charge like a dealer.  Nevertheless, there are competent specialists in most cities, and my opinion is that they will save you money. My wife likes the loaner program, so she values the free loaner very much."
1041,"December  9, 2015  3:07PM",roadburner,"At my BMW dealer I get a 20% discount on service as well as the parts and accessories I pick up for DIY projects.

1046,"December 11, 2015  2:19PM",markcincinnati," I've had two A6's have their brakes replaced and I have the wear pattern progression of both my wife's SQ5 and my S4. She has over 50K on hers and the dealer says she'll probably need new REAR brakes in less than 10K miles from now. Not sure what that means with respect to when the FRONT brakes would need replacing.  Audi suggests new rotors, on our BMW's the service dept said BMW prohibits a ""brake job"" from being carried out without also changing the rotors. On my 2005 A6, I had all four brakes (rotors included) replaced at around 48K miles at no charge under the Audi advantage. That option, via the Audi advantage, now is only free for the first 12K miles if I read the AA correctly.  BMW costs, thankfully covered, were a small four figure number for new brakes for a 2008 X3. Whew, avoided that one.  Audi prices, still breathtaking, seem to be lower, but it seems to me that the costs would be still at least 75% of the BMW costs (at the dealer).  On my 2001 A6, I bought cross drilled rotors (not from the dealer) and took them to the dealer for installation.  I love the brakes on our Audis -- and 50 to 60K for replacement doesn't seem horrible -- what does seem to be the case though is that the costs (using Audi parts) do seem too high. Yet, the brakes are one area that I am certainly not willing to go no-name brand installed at Midas, or where ever.  We'll probably get the new REARS on the SQ5 at the dealer and pay a couple hundred bucks more for peace of mind."
1047,"December 11, 2015  3:12PM",roadburner," They fed you a line; when my BMW dealer replaced the rear pads on my son's X3 at 132,214 miles I was told that the rear rotor thickness was within BMW specs and replacement was not required. markcincinnati said:   BMW costs, thankfully covered, were a small four figure number for new brakes for a 2008 X3.

1049,"December 11, 2015 10:22PM",markcincinnati,"Clarification -- new rotors were only required, so they said, if the pads were being replaced. Can't imagine what other conditions besides a brake rotor and/or brake pad replacement are even possible. The good news, they did it at no charge.  My neighbor was not so lucky -- at 55,000 miles, the front brakes (pads+rotors) were changed on his X5. Parts were, at the time, $900-ish. And then, of course, was the labor. Front only. Front only. Stunning -- and painful."
1050,"December  2, 2015  3:59AM",roadburner, Yep...
1051,"December  2, 2015  4:51AM",markcincinnati,"Used to Be a Pet Peeve, Now Just Confusing  I used to represent these remarks:  I participate some, but read at lot of postings on Audiworld. I read the posts of folks who seem to research and often agonize over the new Audi they have or are about to order.  Then, as time passes, their new prize possessions arrive and they take pictures of their soon to be delivered rides -- they post them and seem to beam with pride about the new car they have acquired.  Next, pictures of the new cars in the owner's driveways or garages are posted -- and the captions on these pics are ""Let the Mods Begin.""  Later, the details of the aftermarket wheels, tires, engine management chips, breathing management aids and even brake rotors are detailed along with the window tinting expenses and, sometimes, even elaborate retrofitting of navigation systems to cars not factory equipped with nav systems are laid out, including the sometimes breathtaking costs required to add such features aftermarket.  In some cases the modifications involve the suspension systems, exhaust systems and underhood plumbing (for the super or turbo chargers) too.  The expenses seem to have no ceiling -- and as soon as one is completed, the next improvement is lusted after in print on the Audiworld forum for that particular model.  Often, so it seems, these mods exceed the costs of simply ordering the cars with the factory upgrade. I mean, really, I have seen folks mod their A4 SLines so much that they reach and sometimes surpass the MSRPs of the car so lusted after, the S4.  The mods that make the A4 have more power often will void the warranty. The S4, stock, comes with a very nice warranty.  Why buy a nearly $50K A4 and mod the crap out of it so that you have more than the cost of an unmodded S4 in it, knowing that the S4 is likely to outperform the modded A4?  Is the joy of modding the joy? If a stock S4 can be had for about the same cost as a modded A4 (which then loses its warranty) what in the wide wide world of sports would posses someone to do this?  BTW, I said, it takes one to know one -- but I must admit, my modding was limited to a chip put into an Audi turbo engine for a total cost well under $1000. But I was so much older then, I'm younger than that now.  Color me confused."

1054,"December  2, 2015  2:50PM",stickguy,"Taking it on a racetrack also counts as not ""wearing"" the car."
1055,"December  2, 2015  3:38PM",roadburner,"I wasn't agreeing about automatics in general, it was only with respect to 320i buyers. I'm always reminded of the idiot I met at my dealer's F30 intro party. Some of us were talking about the F30's potential track capability and one poor fool chimed in to say that he would never take a car to the track, because he works too hard keeping it clean. He went on to say the reason he wanted an automatic was because ""I want to be able to get in the car and not have to think about anything."""
1056,"December  2, 2015  4:33PM",flightnurse," I agree to a point, however, BMW offers factory performance upgrades, I'm sure BMS and others do the same thing these factory upgrades do, more boost, timing, fuel/air mixture."
1057,"December  2, 2015  4:37PM",flightnurse," The Sport Package on the 320i is really a great package, give you all the suspension parts , seats, and steering wheel (M Sport) wheels and tires plus for the first time the 320i can be had with the M Sport Adjustable suspension, this is part of the track package. When it comes to leasing, a 328i with the same packages as the 320i, will lease for less money or slightly more. So the 328i over all is a better value."
1058,"December  2, 2015  5:36PM",dino001," But some people want to have it just the way it is - for them this mix of performance, reliability and gas mileage is just right, not some chipped stuff.

1059,"December  2, 2015  7:51PM",Mr_Shiftright,"Exactly...if you order mods from BMW, you are making a choice about what you are getting and what you might be giving up."
1060,"December  3, 2015 12:40AM",flightnurse," ANd people want more, so your point is?  When it comes to Chipped stuff, I get the same MPG as I did before I chipped my 320i, same reliability, so again your point?"
1061,"December  3, 2015  3:20AM",roadburner," Count me in as one who modifies their cars and who has yet to find a down side(with the exception of my first car, where I added a cam with about ten degrees too much duration). My M6 received a Dinan chip while my Club Sport has a Turner/Conforti chip; it has over 140k on it. My MS3 makes over 60 hp more than stock via a Mazdaspeed intake and a Hypertech tune- and it has 157k on it. I guess I must lead an infinitely charmed life..."
1062,"December  3, 2015  3:57AM",dino001," You say that, but yor statement violates basic principles of engineering. You essentially say you found a way to get something for nothing, no energy in, more energy out, by a wave of a wand. I wish I could do it in structural design, but I can't."
1063,"December  3, 2015  4:42AM",roadburner," My MS3 gets the same mileage as it did prior to installing the tune; there's no magic involved- the tune modifies the ignition advance, fueling, and boost primarily at higher rpm and throttle openings. At cruise the car is running on what is essentially the stock map, with perhaps a bit more spark advance dialed in. For what it's worth, BMW also claims that their MPPK does not affect fuel economy."
1064,"December  3, 2015 12:27PM",dino001,"  But how about reliability, longevity? Can you say with certainty, it's unchanged? Noise, wear, low end vs. high end torque. I suppose it's possible that current factors of safety are so high that the lowering them does not bring appreciable differences. I just caution against ""it's all free"" attitude. In nature, nothing is free. You always pay somewhere. Engineering is an act of balancing competing interests, as people have different interests, it will result in different products, but everything comes with a price."
1065,"December  3, 2015 12:32PM",qbrozen,"Sure, it doesn't affect fuel economy...unless you actually use that extra power, at which point, why tune it at all? So, yes, it does increase fuel usage when you are utilizing those extra ponies. Nothing wrong with that.  As to ""same reliability,"" well, that's a premature argument, and lacks a control. You actually have no idea how it has affected or will affect the reliability. I broke my 135i. Did the mods do it or was it doomed to happen even if stock? There is no way for anybody to know."
1066,"December  3, 2015 12:36PM",kyfdx,"I think that the engineers that design the car could tell you, on a statistical basis, what the likelihood is.  My teenager thinks you can chip a car, with no adverse effects, ever. But, then again, he has never paid a car repair bill.  Want to see the effect of mods? Go shop for a used Subaru WRX, note the mods, then note the repairs."
1067,"December  3, 2015  1:38PM",dino001," Well said. There is no way of saying with certainty that an individual vehicle broke because of the mods. However, the statistics and principles of physics say that the probability of such failure increased, it could be by a little or a lot, depending on how big the mod was, how the car was driven, etc.  It's fine to mod the car, if that's what floats one's boat. The cost may be instantly evident, or deferred in time (perhaps beyond the ownership span), it may be high or low. The benefits may as well be worth it for the owner, outweighing that cost, I'm not disputing that, either. I simply disagree with the ""zero cost whatsoever"" notion."
1068,"December  3, 2015  2:05PM",roadburner,"I think it depends on the vehicle as well as the power increase that is sought. On my modified cars I have only pursued modest gains in horsepower/torque. Those gains might erode the reliability at the margin, but not to any significant extent. UOAs consistently indicate that the engines in my MS3 as well as my Club Sport are in excellent shape, so I'm not losing any sleep over the tweaks the cars have received."
1069,"December  3, 2015  2:25PM",Mr_Shiftright,"I suspect the longevity of your cars relate much more to the high level of maintenance you give them then to the alleged benign nature of the modifications. Also I am sure you would agree that not all chips are engineered to a high standard, and that the consumer who is shopping price rather than reputation may end up with some rather bad results.  I did some homework when I modified the supercharger on my car. I opted for colder spark plugs a larger intercooler and using the very best engine oils. So far so good. I will throw a check engine light though if I do a long hard climb up a mountain on a hot day. No doubt related to fuel mixture."
1070,"December  3, 2015  4:49PM",flightnurse," I believe BMW and for that matter most sport car manufactures have engineered their engines to perform with added stress and still be reliable, I asked this before and you and others haven't comments.. BMW markets the MPK and MPE for their cars, if it would cause added stress and lower reliability why would they make them and warrens them? Maybe they know the engines can take it? Nah that can't be it."
1071,"December  3, 2015  5:47PM",dino001,"You're missing my point entirely. It's not if they can take it, it's which configuration is optimal for certain position in the market, considering all factors. Apparently they believe factory configuration represents a better mix for the market. You say they warrant those mods. Just because it keeps the warranty, doesn't mean it's equally reliable. Do you know what portion of that price is set aside for the warranty? I don't. What I know are principles behind the engineering and they teach me nothing is free, everything is a tradeoff. Small, or large."
1072,"December  4, 2015 12:46AM",flightnurse," Dino I'm sorry you can't grasp the idea that the extra HP from the chips haven't reduced reliability, even Roadrunner has stated he has no problems with 154K miles on a car. All my motorcycles engine have modifications and have been stone reliable."
1073,"December  4, 2015  2:04AM",Mr_Shiftright,"I don't think he missed the point. I think he's making another point. Maybe we could look at it this way. If it was simple and cheap to give a Mazda 3 some 60 more HP, why wouldn't Mazda just do that? It would give them a tremendous edge on the competition and would make the car the darling of the auto magazines. The Mazda engineers must have been weighing something other than cost in this decision. After all, Mazda could build those mods you made for a fraction of what it cost you."
1074,"December  4, 2015  2:29AM",stickguy,"heck, the BMW tune is ""free"" to BMW since they have the computer in there anyway. So it seems like a no brainer to give the car all the extra power for the same price."
1075,"December  4, 2015  2:35AM",qbrozen,"flightnurse said: show previous quotes I believe BMW and for that matter most sport car manufactures have engineered their engines to perform with added stress and still be reliable, I asked this before and you and others haven't comments.. BMW markets the MPK and MPE for their cars, if it would cause added stress and lower reliability why would they make them and warrens them? Maybe they know the engines can take it? Nah that can't be it. Because it is a limited warranty. It is a modest gain in power in those instances and they only need to cover it for 50k, 60k, or what have you. They may know, just for example, the unmodded engines can go 150k, while the modded ones go 120k. Either is certainly covered by warranty, but they'd rather have more of the 150k cars running around to uphold some face. If they made strictly vehicles that only lasted just past their warranty, it wouldn't bode well for their reputation."
1076,"December  4, 2015  2:46AM",dino001,"  Well, one data point is hardly a thesis. Another issue we know little about may be emissions and EPA certification. Do mods change those and how would that change legal picture, if sold as an official model?"
1077,"December  4, 2015  3:58PM",roadburner,"Both the Mazdaspeed Intake as well as the Hypertech Sport Tuner have CARB approval. As to why Mazda didn't sell the car that way from the get-go? In the case of the intake I'd say probably it's due to the fact it uses a washable filter, is a bit louder, and requires a bit more effort to access the filter. As for the tune, Mazda actually did offer a tune on the Australian 3 MPS Extreme, which boosted power by 18 hp and torque by 33 lb-ft."

1091,"November 29, 2015  1:22AM",Mr_Shiftright,"There's probably an effect over time, since there is more stress on components from both increased HP and no doubt, more aggressive driving, but maybe that just means a new X part at 80K rather than 100K. Seems like a low risk item, and BMW owners have confidence in Berger. Naturally, they sell this tune only for offroad use only and won't ship to California of course. It would be interesting to measure how much ""dirtier"" your engine becomes. They're basically messing with boost, timing and mixture, so it must affect emissions in some respects.  Seems like a bargain if you're only paying $10 per 1 HP. Think of what some people spend to get 100 more HP--a lot more than $1,000 bucks."
1092,"November 29, 2015  3:52PM",flightnurse, Dinan get about 50 more HP and charge $1500... Steve Dinan stated that BMW engines are good to about 15% more HP without putting added stress on the engine. But their tune add's much more then 15%.

It is definitely an issue that varies from dealer to dealer. If you've got a service department that is enthusiast friendly than you should be OK. If your dealership's service department is a ""by the book czar,"" then they will find the 6 degrees of separation between your leaking wiper fluid tank and your chip. Once they figure it out, they will void your warranty.  Unfortunately I think part of it is the litigious society we live in today. BMW is very specific about not wanting its customers to modify its vehicles in any way. This includes everything from chips to tires. BMW or its dealerships don't want to be liable."
1101,"November 30, 2015 11:17PM",flightnurse," Brad you are missing the point, BMW knows that people will chip their cars and have a safety net built in regarding added HP. I do not think the BMS stage 1 will cause the engine to be less reliable then a stock engine. I have 38K miles on my 320i and ever have had an engine issue or code thrown. OF course there are those with 320i's who are really pushing those engines making upwards of 300hp. I would assume that BMW, Audi and any manufacture with a turbo engine would assume a certain percentage of owners would ""chip"" their cars to get the extra HP from them. If they don't, then they aren't being realistic."
1102,"November 30, 2015 11:36PM",Mr_Shiftright,"There comes a time in the quest for HP when, if you want a faster car, you should go out and buy a faster car."
1103,"December  1, 2015  3:41AM",nyccarguy,"@flightnurse - I completely understand what you are saying. There are those like yourself who want a little extra oomph (I drive a 175 hp 4cyl Legacy daily so I know about needing and wanting extra oomph), and those that modify the car within an inch of its life. I really don't think BMW wants owners modifying their cars in any way. They don't even want owners checking their own oil with a dipstick for cryin' out loud.  Going with what @Mr_Shiftright said, did you price out a 328i similarly equipped to your 320i? Now that you have Rick's 328xi GT back stateside, have you driven the 2 cars back to back? Do you plan to keep your 320i for the long haul or will you start looking once the end of the 50K warranty is coming near?  I hope you don't think I'm trying to pick a fight with you. I'm honestly curious to your mindset. I'm completely neurotic when it comes to ""pushing the envelope"" with certain things. I KNOW I'd be the guy that gets caught & has to fight not to get my warranty voided.  Just as an example, this past Saturday night my wife & I took our 3 kids to an AHL (minor league) hockey game. We always get the kids something to eat when we go to an event, but we do like to bring our own juice, water, & snacks so we don't spend a car payment on concessions. My wife brings a bag in, holding our daughter & gets waved right through. My bag gets searched thoroughly & a few bottles of water as well as bags of chips get tossed before I walk in."
1104,"December  1, 2015  5:02PM",flightnurse," I made a mistake when I bought my 320i, I should have gotten a 328i. Listen learned... I almost pulled a trigger on a BMW Loaner, basically it was a fully loaded 328i, M Sport, Tech, DHP, Premium, Drivers Assistance package, heated seats. It only had 4K miles on it, MSRP was 52K, final sale price was $44K, but I would have had to roll about 9K into the deal, lease payments would have been about 576/m with zero out of pocket. decided not to do it. I'll tough it out until Oct 2017 when we a another ED. I like the M2, but I think it will be small, I'm hoping that BMW will build a M4 Grand Coupe for 2018, if not then a 440i Grand Coupe it shall be, with the MPPK, and MPE, which makes more HP then the BMW stage 1."
1105,"December  1, 2015  5:04PM",flightnurse," Yes, before I put the BMS on Rick's 328, I did back to back rides, and even though the GT is heavier it felt faster. Now that the GT has the BMS, it is much faster then my 320i."
1106,"December  2, 2015  2:28AM",sweendogy,"Couple of things what is BMS? (My wife gets the other MS monthly) In my eyes BMW has the right to void any warrantee - certainly on leased cars because they make mucho duckets on the used market - I get that.  @Mr_Shiftright has a point here - if you can afford the extra payment go for power. BMW offers ""el cheapo"" to get people in the door. Real enthusiasts will pay more for 328 or 333 or even m cars."
1107,"December  2, 2015  2:51AM",Mr_Shiftright,"Factory engineers have to compromise to give consumers a streetable package, decent MPG, good longevity, and a car that passes all emissions requirements. If they could just chip a car and give it a large HP boost over the competition, they would have done it. Obviously they didn't for some reasons related to the above parameters."
1108,"December  2, 2015  3:23AM",roadburner,"I think that a ""real enthusiast"" who isn't a horsepower junkie might buy a properly equipped 320i- but I'll concede that probably 99% of 320i buyers are ""lease to wear"" poseur/dweebs. BMS= Burger Motorsports; their JB4 Performance Tuner is a very well regarded piece of equipment in the BMW community."

1110,"November  5, 2015  6:31PM",robr2,Standalone stores were the plan. Then that nasty little worldwide recession hit and they had to scale back. Nobody was interested in spending the money to launch a new luxury brand. 
1111,"November  5, 2015  6:43PM",Michaell,"Remember, Mazda thought about doing this as well back in the 90's - brand was to be called ""Amati"". Would have included the Millenia and, I think, the 929.  I agree - stand alone stores are really needed to make this work. Hard to sell $15K Accents alongside the $60K Equus and provide the type of buying and servicing experience expected by the buyers of the latter."
1112,"November  5, 2015  7:39PM",markcincinnati,"I read the test report of the new Genesis 5.0 sedan in C&D, and, mostly, the report indicates the Genesis 5.0 Ultimate Super-duper bla bla bla could be considered to be a lot of car for the money (and the handling issues seem to have been largely erased, to boot) -- if it were a Mercedes E class. The issue is that certain less than impressive feeling of going into the dealership and seeing the $50K+ Genesis alongside some lesser model priced (via lipstick painted on the windshield [very claaaasssy]) well below $20K.  At least the A3's seem to not be THAT out of character next to the A6's over at the Audi dealer.  And, as was mentioned above, the service department at the Audi, BMW and Mercedes dealerships are brilliantly lit and hospital surgical suite clean (or so it seems). But the Hyundai service bays, while probably competent don't look like places I'd want to walk in/on in my Cole-Haan's.  The whole ""Genesis as a brand"" vibe, currently, needs a refresh. At least the brand -- naming -- will be undergoing rationalization, à la Audi, BMW, Cadillac and even Infiniti (mostly), etc.  Now, then, speaking of VW, the new VW stores have very nice service departments and waiting rooms -- perhaps not quite up to BMW or Lexus standards, but close enough for Jazz. Of course we have a Lexus dealer that has a big buck chandelier hanging prominently in the customer area; and, we also have a Chevy dealer with a huge ""wall of fire"" fireplace in it as well as a sort of mini Chevy museum inside the customer area. Go figure.  Nevertheless, there is something about the Genesis line that I believe foreshadows a serious threat to the high-zoot Europeans. And, I like that -- keeps them on their toes.  At this point, though, I agree with those who find the juxtaposition of the Genesis line with the Hyundai line somewhat difficult to swallow.  Time will tell."
1113,"November  5, 2015  8:00PM",sda," I think that is one of the issues that Ford has with Lincoln. A lot of Lincoln dealers are included with Ford dealerships and not stand alone.

1115,"November  5, 2015 10:23PM",graphicguy," Around here, they forced the Lincoln dealers to become standalone several years ago. Plus, they closed some, too.

1120,"November  8, 2015 12:10PM",circlew,"Oil change costs may be headed for steep drop  Motor-oil maker Castrol, a division of BP, recently claimed its technicians have achieved a breakthrough in engine-lubrication design that makes it easy to change the oil in a vehicle in as little as 90 seconds. http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2015/11/07/oil-change-costs-quick-lube-castrol-nexcel/74615512/  Regarding oil change intervals: ""Improvements in the quality and durability of modern oil have removed the need to change it at 3,000-mile intervals,"" Kelley Blue Book analyst Karl Brauer said in an email. ""Consumers are wasting their time and money if they change oil with less than 5,000 miles on it.""  Kelley Blue Book analyst Rebecca Lindland said ""engine technology has evolved so the engine runs cleaner and oil last longer, allowing for more miles between changes.""  Many vehicles can travel 5,000, 7,000, 10,000 or 15,000 miles before needing an oil change, according to the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery. To be sure, however, AAA recommends checking your oil level once a month to ensure smooth operation.  Drivers should check their owner's manuals to see when the manufacturer recommends getting an oil change. Many vehicles from the 2000 model year and newer can be checked here: /www.calrecycle.ca.gov/UsedOil/OilChange/FindInterval/."
1121,"November  8, 2015  2:17PM",robr2,I had read about that new system from Castrol on another forum. It's a great idea but it will require the commitment from an automaker in order to get it started. Who will be the first?
1122,"November  8, 2015  2:29PM",stickguy,"interesting. but probably not as great as it may seem. First of all, hard to see it being cheaper overall, since you still have to pay for the oil, and the contraption.  plus, to get a 90 second change, you are giving up key parts of the process. That is, inspecting the underside of the car, and checking all the other fluids, air filter, etc. That is the biggest part of the infrequent service, which tends to be generically referred to as an ""oil change"".  heck, the changing the oil part of it probably only takes 5 minutes or less. Drive over the pit, pop the hood, remove filter, put on new filter, put in oil, drive away. Oh, remember to close hood!  does look like a slick system. I assume the filter is all built in (but can you top up the oil level in it?). Could also have advantages in packaging, if it works like a dry sump so no oil pan needed? Would have to see a better description of it.  but purely in terms of changing the oil, I still want every thing else checked at the same time. I can spare the 1/2-1.0 hours once a year!"
1123,"November  8, 2015  2:49PM",markcincinnati,"Our experience with Acura, Audi, BMW and Infiniti over the past decade+ is that the oil change includes an inspection, report and other fluids top off; also included is a wash and vacuum. Tire pressure, too, is checked and set and sometimes tire rotation is part of the deal.  We drop the car off at 6PM, pick up the loaner and come back the next day at 6PM and pick up the car; conversely, if you don't want that level of involvement, you can opt for the dealer to come to you, pick up the car, leave a loaner and return later with your car, all services accomplished.  90 second oil changes seem like something you might want on your car once the od shows in excess of 50,000 miles -- MAYBE.. My opinion is that I want to visit the dealer for the above noted services even after the warranty has expired.  Of course, THIS TIME, my grand plan (?) is to ""CPO"" my own car (at the dealership) which will extend the factory warranty to 100,000 miles. This ""experiment"" also includes buying two ""service packs"" which will take the factory mntce program to 85,000 miles.  My wife's 2014 SQ5 just hit 49,900 miles -- and we're going to ""run naked"" on this one -- thinking we'll trade it in sometime shortly after it crosses 90,000 miles, since there seems to be a huge resale drop in value at about 100K miles.  This is all new territory for us, since her SQ5 is the first car we've owned since 1977.  I'll let you know how this works out in a couple of years."
1124,"November  8, 2015  3:15PM",robr2," Correct. Dry sump and the oil filter is integrated. As for the underside inspections, that can still be done as part of a service.  A major benefit is the ability to recycle the system. The used units and the oil are returned to Castrol and they in turn would ensure the oil and the components are disposed of in an environmentally friendly manner. Of course, Castrol has a business angle as well. Since they own the patent, any vehicle outfitted with Nexcell would have to use this cartridge."
1125,"November  8, 2015  7:09PM",Mr_Shiftright,"Hey, they could also sell a follow-up oil analysis!"
1126,"November  8, 2015  7:12PM",stickguy,"that unit looks like it takes up a lot of space. Seemed to be as big as a battery. that is going to be a tough sell. Sure, they free up room at the bottom of the engine, but that won't help with packaging under the hood! Unless they put it on top of the engine, like the old Subaru's that had the spare tire there."
1127,"November  8, 2015  8:33PM",dino001,"Hyundai just announced a new upscale brand, Genesis. They say something like 4 or 5 models will be introduced. Interesting.

1128,"November  8, 2015  9:22PM",flightnurse," It was simple, VW wanted to let buyers know that their cars are just as good as those other premium brands. Look at their product back then, the passt was really high end as far as fit and finish, and materials used, but it also was more expensive then the Camry's and Accords too. But we know that the upscale of VW failed and the bean counters got a hold of the cars, the new passt is nice, but no where as nice as the previous gen. The Golf feels upscale and some of the materials used is nicer then what one would get in Sentra or Corrola but those cars have more standard equipment then the Golf.  BTW, I wonder how many ""joe"" buying public knows that VW, Audi and Porsche are all owned by the same company? When we were looking for a SUV, we looked at the Touareg TDI, the salesman didn't mention that the Audi Q7 and Touareg were the same SUV."
1129,"November  8, 2015  9:36PM",flightnurse," Rick would get calls from the Hyundai deal to come and trade in his Genesis and the salesman would give him the big pitch about how Hyundai has made strides in quality and refinement. On one of his secret shopping assignment we went to a Kia dealer to look at the new (then) Cadenza, we both liked the car, it was room, the list of standard equipment was extensive and the price (base) was right in the middle of the V6 Honda Accord line.Talking with the salesman we asked about the K900, he laughed and told us that each Kia dealer was getting 1, and that is it. But of course some dealers didn't sell it and did a dealer trade to move it off the lot, the car was more of an exercise in, ""look what we can do, and showcase what Kia could be."" When it comes to Hyundai and the Genises and Equus I think you are going to see Hyundai move up scale with that brand. Both cars are bargains, they are reliable, and really a good bang for the buck, it has taken Hyundai years to be able to sell cars like those here, and yes, Virginia they really do sell Equus. I'm thinking the accents cars are going away, and left for Kia to sell."

1131,"November  9, 2015  2:13AM",markcincinnati," Wellllll . . . the platform underpinning the Cayenne, Q7 and Touareg are shared. The new Macaan shares about 1/3 of its foundation, so to speak, with the SQ5, but each company puts it own completely different finishing touches on their versions.  I have a great deal of fondness for the VW Touareg, but few would think it was same SUV as the Cayenne.  The various brands do much to differentiate their offspring from the donor chassis. Audi and Porsche use different transmissions, engines, etc. VW, no matter how high up the chain it goes isn't the same SUV (as the others) any more than the Passat is, er, an A6, etc."

So, lot of experience with VW's 4 cylinder turbos. I specifically went for the Mazda3 to get a different feel - a more traditional n/a 4 cylinder with a linear feel in acceleration.  I'd say there is a very distinct feel between something like a 1.8T A3 and the Mazda 3s. And I'd add the 1.8T, in most any of the applications, feels a bit more upscale.

1159,"November  4, 2015  9:58PM",markcincinnati,"Why Drive ‘All-Wheel’ drive cars (that have automatic transmissions)?  Those of you who have, er, suffered through my 5,000+ posts over the past years know that I am an advocate for – some might even say obsessed with – quattro, X-drive, 4Matic, SH-AWD, 4Sure-4Sure, etc. drive trains. Several folks do adamantly oppose all-wheel-drive, favoring instead rear-wheel-drive (and only rarely favoring front-wheel-drive). Likewise some folks are seemingly violently opposed to any transmission that lacks a clutch pedal, regardless of the tonnage of empirical evidence suggesting some clutch-pedal-less models actually outperform those with a clutch.  Not long ago, I was one of the Luddites who bemoaned the death of the manual transmission cars – now, however, with both my physical skills and reading habits apparently still at peak performance, I hereby concede the 7-spd DSG transmission (and its shift programming and ability to ‘learn’) offered by Audi (and others) is superior to even the best 6-spd manual I’ve ever had the pleasure to have known.  But what I’m on about – in the majority – today is the darn near universal adoption of all-wheel-drive as either literally or virtually standard on the premium cars we opine about here: Acuras, Audis, BMWs, Cadillacs, Infinitis, Lexus, Mercedes and Volvos. As a practical matter, here in Cincinnati at least, it has become increasingly difficult to find just about any model from these manufacturers that aren’t ‘typically’ stocked almost exclusively in its AWD configuration. Cincinnati generally does not have much in the way of snowfall, so I find it hard to believe this phenomenon (the explosion of AWD premium vehicles) is unduly influenced by our winter weather (which produces some, but not much, cold and snowfall.)  The, um, ‘purists’ decry AWD’s weight penalty, added complexity and cost, and seem to associate the addition of AWD to a BMW (especially) or Mercedes (or Porsche) as akin to the brand publically emasculating itself with a rusty razor blade. To these folks, well, “It ain’t a purty sight,” to watch their beloved RWD stick shift wielding brands eschew everything that made them special.  Horse-hockey!  First off, let’s stipulate we’re (I’m) talking about the cars we can buy to drive on the public streets, roads and highways almost exclusively. This means I’m not going to presume you’re shopping for a new BMW or Cadillac or even Mercedes C class in the $50,000+ range so that you can drive (your new machine, your personal means of transportation for the things you do in your life) from the dealer to the race track or drag strip (if such things – ‘drag strips’ – have somehow managed to stay off of the politically incorrect list and, of course, still actually exist outside of an historical reference) as if such activities are de rigueur.  No, what I’m on about here is our everyday (and every weekend) cars – no matter that they may be some form of a Luxury Performance Sedan (brand and model) configuration.  In order, I say, you’re better off with (in order) an AWD, FWD and finally RWD vehicle – generally speaking. Yes, there are activities and (mere) moments where your beloved RWD may demonstrate its superiority over the other drive line configurations. But, from a practical perspective, RWD for most folks is the ‘least-best’ configuration if you actually buy your car to drive (principally, primarily – or virtually exclusively, that is), year ‘round on our public streets, roads and highways. Conversely, AWD is the best configuration you can employ to navigate our public streets, roads and highways.  Now, thanks to Bing and Google, it is possible to find apparently endless studies, tests, opinion pieces, essays and love letters for your favorite set-up. However, what does appear to be happening (again) is what was once (in the early 1980’s) referred to as the time between the parenthesis, the time between eras. In the context of both ‘Megatrends’ (the book I am referencing) and the number and location of a car’s driven wheels (and manual transmissions, to a lesser extent), ""[Some] are clinging to the known past in fear of the unknown future."" Believe it or not, over five years ago, in the March 24, 2010, edition of the Wall Street Journal it was written:  “Rear-wheel drive may not even be that important for some of BMW's new customers. Mr. Reithofer (then BMW AG’s chairman) told analysts. . .that BMW had a survey that found 80% of the customers for the BMW compact 1 series, which in Europe is sold mainly with four-cylinder engines, didn't know it was a rear-wheel drive car.”  The same 2010 article concluded: “The truth is that most drivers probably can't tell whether they are driving one kind of car or another. As technology narrows the performance differences, ""luxury cars don't have to be defined by which ends drive them.""  On-line comments posted in response to this article included:  ""I grew up driving RWD cars in the snowy mid-west. I can tell you FWD cars take all the fun out of winter driving. My first experience was with a rented Toyota corolla near Vail, CO. With a foot of fresh snow I was able to easily maintain 55 mph, with the car tracking like a champ. Any RWD car would have been in the ditch over 35 mph.""  And so it goes.  RWD may – but it is increasingly difficult to prove – offer that certain je ne sais quoi, a ‘quality or trait that cannot be described or named easily.’ But technology has virtually wiped out the recognizable differences and, I would argue, has – in the best configurations such as those offered by many premium auto manufacturers, literally wiped out the unrecognizable (some would call them measurable) differences.  Still, some (or many depending upon your bias) front-wheel-drive cars suffer, at least somewhat, from the reputation as being unexciting to drive.  Maybe, like so many other things (or everything else?), it’s all about ‘da money’ – FWD is cheaper to make, provides better packaging and can also provide lower emissions and higher MPG’s. Yet, with the apparently relentless increase in the up-take of AWD cars, CUV's and, of course, SUV's, that may not be true; it may be that the market [you and I] simply perceive AWD to be the best (and remember perception IS reality)!  Then, when the market (aka ‘you’) do finally get yourself to the point of either wanting better and better performance, or perhaps wanting the Ultimate Driving Experience, you end up in a top o’ the line 3, 5 or 7 series – with X-drive, natch.  Nothing even comes close to a fine fine German AWD sedan (as we discuss them here, classified as either ELLPS or LPS cars).  RWD (like the manual transmission) is rapidly becoming an historical footnote – far as I can tell, most Millennials have AWD or FWD vehicles and can’t even drive a stick.  Of course, if they're driving a DSG equipped car, they are almost certainly shifting better than you or I, on our best days, can shift a stick.  . . . and then you die.  Drive it like you live."

I do know her interior looks and feels a bit nicer than mine. Being our first time going German, these are just my initial reactions to what I see and feel.

It shifts so quick, is so veristile being a gentlemens salon to a sports sedan in a second and can get 30mpg on the highway- in fact as my s4 gets older (25k miles) it gets 20-22 in the city. Compared to my g35x it's night and day as I was getting city figures on the highway- and I loved that car. On the awd weight issue thing... With the optional limited slip diff you could never guess when pressing car into turns that its awd and weighs as much as a whale. I love the car.

1162,"November  5, 2015  1:10AM",stickguy,"Sandy, in theory it is not the same engine. mostly the same, but Audi may be tuned differently, which could explain the different feel, and premium. But, more likely it is just that the Audi has more sound insulation or some such. Check the specs on the 2 cars. see if output is any different (peak HP/torque, at what RPM). if they are the same, probably just psychological ploy, since premium buyers expect premium fuel!  I had this issue with my RDX. Same engine family as IIRC the Accord (only the last letter was different). Had almost identical (within 1-2) ratings both ways, at the same RPM. I could find no difference that meant premium recommended on the Acura but not the Honda applications.  I have used both. Never found a difference."

Given that Mark and I live in the same area of OH (Cincinnati and its 'burbs), I concur, we get little in the way of snowfall. When and if we do get it, it's either a dusting, or a BIG snow storm. I have a snow blower. I've gone 2-3 years sometimes without using it.  So, why the AWD in ELLPS? Must be a ""tick box"" for the upscale brands, particularly once they cross that $50K threshold. Personally, I would have no issues going RWD...matter of fact, I had done so for years with no ill effects. But, there's a perception around here....you pay that sort of money, you better get all the manufacturer's tech/features that come in their play book. AWD is one of them.  All that said, AWD mechanisms have become pretty sophisticated (everyone has a version of torque vectoring these days), and effects handling in a very positive way. Plus, the days of yore, when AWD systems were big, clunky and heavy, have passed. They are now controled by computer, using light(er) weight materials and seem to be fairly robust and reliable.  IF it weren't for the enhanced handling of the Torque Vectoring AWD systems today, I'd probably look to buy my cars in warmer climes where I could find RWD examples to buy, and drive them up here to park in the GG estate.  Sween...I heard about the Genesis finally moving to be its own brand. I think it's the right move for them. That's the ONLY way they'll get ELLPS people in their showrooms."

It also has most every available option, including M Sport brakes as well as the M Performance aerodynamics. Don't know the price, mileage, or CPO status, but the car may be worth considering. It's nowhere near as quick as I'd prefer, but that can be fixed easily enough.

1176,"October 24, 2015  1:34PM",markcincinnati," I think there are certainly many examples of products that are -- for whatever reasons -- equal to or even better than other products but the two products are in different classes. Let me give a non-auto example: Tissot makes/markets watches. These time pieces are often feature laden, attractive and cost a fraction of other Swiss made time pieces. Breitling makes/market watches. These time pieces are often feature laden, attractive and cost many multiples of ""similar"" Tissot time pieces.  It is possible to pick up a ""higher end"" Tissot with about every modern watch feature and function (complications) known to humans -- and the thing will cost hundreds of dollars (and is often discounted on top of that).  It is virtually impossible to pick up a ""lower end"" Breitling that has only a date a sweep second hand function for under $2,000. Far as I know they both will tell time equally well and both will last for decades, lifetimes even.  Tissots, even ones studded with diamonds, are not considered high-end watches. A watch super-store such as Tourneau sells Rolex, Movado, Tag and also sells Bulova, Seiko and Tissot -- if a Tourneau outlet is near you, check out the brands, perhaps you'll see what I'm referring to. The Rolex is to BMW as Seiko or Tissot is to the Genesis. The market perceives what it perceives. And in the instance of BMW vs Genesis like Rolex and Seiko, ""Perception is Reality.""  Dimensions, decibels at 70MPH, number of speakers in the sound system, suppleness of ride or even country of origin doesn't change -- or hasn't thus far changed -- the reality that the Genesis is not currently considered an LPS vehicle; indeed, it is also not, yet, considered an ELLPS vehicle.  It, the Genesis, is a ""cheap car that's really nice""[sic].  Similarly, the Toyota Avalon isn't a Lexus -- probably for the same perception reason. My feelings of consternation regarding the A3 vs the rest of the Audi lineup (or, similarly, the entry level Mercedes vs the other Merc's) still stands. Likewise: My belief that Tissot makes timepieces that equal Breitling's products, insofar as their ability to keep time, also stands -- but I don't for a minute think that Tissot or Seiko, etc, are high-end Premium watches.  Genesis' cars, no matter how feature laden, no matter how statistically similar, etc, are not in the same class as BMW's. The market's perception, not mine, not yours -- currently indicating BMW is LPS and Genesis is not -- is reality.  Maybe there will be a reversal of fortune for both of these successful companies -- thus far, there is scant evidence of that. Perhaps, however, Genesis will -- eventually -- come to be perceived as a Premium Car.  Time(pieces) will tell."

1183,"October 25, 2015 12:49AM",breld,"My wife got her S3 this past August and absolutely loves it. For her, it was about getting something with much of the ""character"" of the GTI she traded it in, but in a package that was more refined and mature. The S3 may feel rougher than an S4 (more on that below), but I would say it's much more refined than, say, a WRX. No doubt you're paying for that premium, but once you really load up a GTI, WRX or certainly a Golf R, the premium for the Audi gets much more palatable (at least it was for us).  Now, I was impressed enough with her S3 that I returned to the Audi dealership and bought my S4 a few weeks later. And, after a few months of driving my S4 and having ample seat time in her S3....I'd agree, for the most part, with @markcincinnati regarding the difference in luxury between the two.  In fact, and I posted this on the CCBA forum too, this S4 may be my favorite car I've owned. The balance between the sporty dynamic and luxury is impressive. To me, it feels like it falls in between two of my previous cars - an e90 335i and an f10 535i, offering most of the comfort of the 5 and most of the sport of the 3. Sort of a Goldilocks ""just right"" choice.  I had debated between the great DSG and the manual, but in the end, I figured if Audi was still gonna offer the manual, I was gonna stick with they dying breed. And it is a great manual trannie - very ""easy"" to drive in traffic and for me, really adds to the overall experience. Not that there aren't times in my long work commute that I would prefer a nice auto, but I'll take advantage of it now while it's still being offered - doubt it will be for much longer."

Now the situation is different and no longer need to drive those kind of vehicles and tried going the CUV route back in December of 2013 and bought a mid-line Hyundai Tucson. Very nice vehicle to be sure and enjoyed it for awhile but it just was a bit too big for me so just over a year later, swapped it out for something smaller. Wanted an A3 like the wife had bought the week earlier but didn't have the $ for one so got a very similar driving vehicle in my VW Golf. Perfect size and fun to drive plus I feel like I've got a 3/4 A3 so all is good. Luckily, I don't worry or care about what others think about what I drive or where I live. Sure I would've liked to have bought a nicer vehicle like the A3 but didn't want to live beyond our means like so many folks do and I drive too many miles to lease.

The cars we like are liked by us, because WE like them, not because we might have to explain to our buddies that we're driving a Genesis made by Hyundai -- or a whatever made by whomever.  My thesis was simply, don't change the brand. The downmarket Rolex is NOT called a Rolex -- I simply don't think an A3, TODAY, or the CLA, TODAY, should be Audi branded or Mercedes branded. Maybe these models will rapidly rise so as to fit in the family.  At this point, if I can get my hands on a new S4 in a year or two -- and it has not been pushed down in some way -- I really don't mind the A3/S3 being what I think, TODAY, should be a member of the VW family.  Evenutually, however, if the A3 foreshadows a decline, well, I may have to reconsider.  I looked at some ""high end"" KIA's today. They are feature rich and very attractive,. They seem high value -- a nice, no very nice, cheap car. But, and it is probably me, I cannot see myself driving a car with KIA on the steering wheel -- I just keep seeing Killed In Action.

In regards to my original Mazda 3 comment, I'm just kind of a value buyer and to me Mazda is what Honda used to be - sporty and high value. To me a fully loaded $30K or so Mazda 3 (what I categorize as ""a cheap car that feels nice"") would provide the driving dynamics and still luxury interior and features that would be more pleasing (to me) than a much more stripped A3 at a similar price that is ""a nice car that feels cheap"".  I've owned an Audi in the past and to me the A3 is just a bit too downmarket for the brand. At the time I bought my A4 with a 6 cylinder, sport package, manual tranny, in 1998, the A4 was the ""value choice"" as compared to the BMW 3-series of the day.

Mine was the Grand Touring model with the appearance package, and at $26k, it was (and is) an excellent car. Great driving dynamics, adequate power, and a better infotainment system than my Audi.  To be fair though, the overall interior quality is inferior, in some measure, to the A3/S3.

There is still a difference between ""prestige"" cars and those whose badge carries no particular cachet.

I opted for the new for this year twin-turbo 2.7L engine, which is entirely unproven. (As to longevity, I mean.) If I had planned to keep the truck ""until the wheels turn square"", most likely would have opted for the old school V8 engine. With this particular engine (the twin turbo), if I were to decide to keep it past end of warranty, I will most likely spring for the extended factory warranty BEFORE the base warranty expires.  Just something about the first year for a brand new engine, especially a ""twin turbo"" design ..."
1202,"October 21, 2015  3:33PM",andres3," I just got my 35K mile service at 34K miles (did it early). I did it early mainly due to the fact I skipped/missed my 30K mile oil change. Don't listen to Audi if you plan on keeping the car a long time; best advice is change the oil every 5K miles no matter how good the oil is. If you plan on not keeping it much past the 50K warranty, then Audi's advice to do 10K maintenance intervals is sound. Otherwise, the best advice I've received is that it is not a good idea to skimp.  What did your 35K S4 service include?  I told them to include the engine air filter whether it said to do it or not. They also did my cabin air filter, the motor oil, and I asked for a front brake service including new fluid as my pads were starting to scratch metal on metal on 1/2"" ring just a week before my scheduled service (took two weeks to get into this shop from when I called; they are too good and popular and busy as a result!). Rotors when correctly priced even the large fronts were only $125 each, but still a hard pill to swallow twice now for me (due to track-use). This time, (unlike the first which was totally my fault for ignoring the sensor lights), I didn't get all the dummy light sensors warning me my pads were low; might need to ask Audi why the brake pad sensors didn't warn me and to pony up for the rotors as a result Also need to ask my shop again what the diagnosis/theory is for the failure of the sensors to warn me I was scoring my rotors with metal on metal contact. Perhaps the pads were unevenly worn from overheating during 100+ degree track days; causing the lack of warning. Need to follow up with them. My front pads are not really meant to be track abused more than probably 1 weekend (they were put through 2 as well as 19,000 miles).  CR came out with 2014/15 results of the most reliable Car brands, and Audi as real-world observance between you and I seems to agree with, is at the top of the chart along with a couple others for good reason. Impeccably built, quality controlled, and constructed is what comes to mind as the right words.  I was charged 2.1 hours for 35K service which included the oil/filter, air filter, cabin pollen filter, brake fluid flush, & inspection. Charged 1.5 hours to replace the front rotors and pads."

Of course you can elect to keep the 10K interval and for all I know things will be fine -- we have decided at this time we want to be MORE THAN FINE and figured doubling up on the oil and filter changes is worth doing.  We are, too, planning on buying the service packs at 45K which will provide no charge services at 55K and 65K. We will, however, keep up the every other interval (meaning double) practice.  Mine (the S4) can be CPO's prior to 50K miles which will extend the warranty to 100K miles -- my wife's, since we own it, cannot be CPO'd, but we're going to run the risk of something bad happening and go ""naked"" after 50K on the SQ5. The plan, currently, is to trade the SQ5 around 90K, since a BIG HIT in depreciation happens when you drive the car off the lot and again at close to 100K.

I also know that manufacturer's have a built-in incentive to make cars last as long as the warranty, but no longer. Planned obsolescence forces you to buy more new cars more frequently. This strategy works great except some manufacturer's have the decency to have the experience of their customer's more in mind rather than just the short-term bottom line. Also, a lot of luxury companies still offer either free maintenance, or try to sell discounted packaged pre-paid maintenance. It's a lot cheaper and easier to sell if you can say 50K miles of maintenance, and only have 5 service visits. They only need to make it last the term of the warranty, or the lease. An owner might have other desires and concerns."

The 10K intervals are based on several factors, one being that these cars do have large oil capacities. My wife's Infiniti suggested oil change intervals of 3,750 with non syn oil. We changed the oil on that one every 7,500 and used full syn oil.  Maybe this is snake oil, so to speak.  I have no insider info that says 5K changes are necessary. Logic only leads me to the conclusion that 5K intervals cannot hurt and MAY help with engine lifespan.  I really like my S4. There is, at this point, no known US availability date for the B9 S4. I figure I need to keep my current car probably another 2 years. I have every incentive, therefore, to HOLD onto this S4 -- and god knows repairs to German cars are breathtakingly expensive.  So, I figure it this way, ""what the heck, twice as many oil changes have no material downside.""

1222,"October 23, 2015  5:42PM",markcincinnati,"Inculcation  As I look at the posts here, I notice there are some of us who have thousands of posts, some have dozens. I could be wrong, but I also assume there are people (and I have been one from time to time) who lurk, but don't post. Moreover, I also assume there are folks who may research (and dream about) their next vehicle using the manufacturer's web sites. The problem with doing that is that those sites are entirely marketing oriented -- there is nothing that could provoke ""other brand (and maybe even other model) thinking.""  This is one of the key benefits of participating in an Edmund's Forum -- you may be provoked.  One of the most popular classes of cars is the class that is discussed in this very forum, ELLPS -- but even within our ranks we differ on what is or is not EL (entry level). I often argue that EL pertains most to the basic chassis (grossly, the ""size""). This means a BMW 3 series, no matter how modest or how out there (in any way you wish to construe this) is an ELLPS car (meaning I would include an M3 unless or until some more granular classification is heartily adopted by folks who flock to Edmunds.)  I found it difficult -- but I acknowledge other's POVs -- to consider two Acura's, for instance, built on separate wheelbases/chassis to be candidates for ELLPS classification. Likewise, I have difficulty considering, again as an example, both the A3 and A4 offerings from Audi to be considered in the same class. Again, my rationale is more size (length and width, i.e.) derived than MSRP or HP or torque, derived. Also, I think a certain Premium-ness is required to be in this club.  Recently, there have been ""trial"" balloons loosed suggesting that the A3 family, now that there is an S3 available, merits inclusion in the ELLPS category. Folks [some] suggest that the acceleration numbers put forth by the S3, since they are a few tenths of a second less than that of an S4, render the S4 a good candidate to be passed over when one is shopping in the over $45,000 category. After all, a balls-to-the-wall S3 can be had for something in the $51,000 neighborhood and a maxed out S4 can command $10,000 more. Why bother paying more is the either stated or implied thought.  Having two late model Audis gives both my wife and me multiple chances to ""legitimately"" test-drive almost every car in the Audi lineup, since they are all in the loaner fleet. I may have mentioned my wife got to be the very first user of a 2016 A8L for 24-hours while her SQ5 was in for new shoes and an all-wheel alignment and oil+filter change. Last week, my turn came in the form of an A7 (which, I must say, I was underwhelmed with).  Couple these multiple legitimate test drives with the hobby test drives we repeat Audi customers are afforded, and you might be able to grant that the missus and I are very well qualified [amateur] Audi experts.  With this as a backdrop, I must tell you about yet another S3 experience we've had and the conclusions that can be drawn vis a vis the S4.  Being quicker to 60mph . . . see next post."
1223,"October 23, 2015  5:42PM",markcincinnati,"Being quicker to 60mph  There is a lot to like about the S3. There is a whole lot to like about the S3 if you've not driven an S4. The pricing of the S3 does seem, if you go to a dealer that has both S3's and S4's on the showroom floor, difficult to justify -- again if you've driven (or own, especially) a B8 S4 post 2012, for instance.  I found the S3 to be a bit quicker than the S4 (both cars are equally fast) -- or it felt that way, perhaps -- at the slow speeds. But the S4 with the DSG in ""S"" mode, does seem to be able to get things done in a more sorted, I would say ""better"" fashion; the S4 is noticably smoother and, yes, does things with a feeling that it does have more urge, than the S3. This may be a function of the extra gear, I dunno.  The S3 seemed to dart -- perhaps it seems to ""flinch"" when the wheel is turned. That reaction certainly is indicative of some level of responsiveness, but I did find the S4, even when set to dynamic mode, to be responsive without flinching.  The S3 felt light -- and that is a good thing. But when you close (er, slam) the doors on the S3 (vs the S4), the sound is slightly tinny, evoking some sense that I can only say reminds me of my 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance: flimsy. Please note -- I am not saying the S3 is flimsy. It does ""sound"" decidedly less solid than the S4 when the doors are slammed however.  For short trips, the S3 was a blast to drive -- but on the frost-heaved Interstate highways we have here in SW Ohio, any speed less than 80 was choppy, harsh almost. In contrast the S4 at 70 over the same surface just feels solid and ""firm.""  The S4 at any speed under 100 (I couldn't get the real estate to get the S3 over 100 on our crowded Interstates here in Cincinnati) is quieter, one could almost call the S4 luxurious, smooth, supple, etc. The S4 feels like a premium car from just about any perspective I can think of -- while the S3 seems like every surface that you can touch is a bit thinner, hinting at being brittle, in fact. The S3 is made of good stuff, but the stuff feels a bit more economy class, than premium class, however,  The thing is, I do like the S3, but it almost seems like it should have been brought out first (in its present iteration) under the VW logo, rather than under the four-rings.  I took a second drive in a balls-to-the-wall equipped version of an S3 and found a drive around the interstate surrounding Cincinnati (I-275) to be almost punishing -- especially at any speeds under 80. The S3 is a modern day buck-board when equipped with the largest wheels/tires (in summer config) and with the Audi-Drive-Select set to Dynamic.  Yes it is a very high-end go-kart. And, to me, a very high-priced one at that.  My 2014 S4 has its faults -- and it was $57K+, nearly $7K more than the S3, that is -- but the S3 needs to go to finishing school to shed some of its harsher edges. Hell, it can even keep some of the ""boy-racer"" characteristics, since I am of the opinion that I don't want the S3 to be a substitute for an S4, anymore than I want the S4 to be a substitute for an S6.  The S3 may be -- in fact the statistics seem to say that it is -- quicker than an S4 (not faster, quicker), but I am not looking for Audi to produce a WRX or WRX STI (not that there is anything wrong with those Subaru models). I am looking for Audi to produce and market Premium and even perhaps Super-Premium Luxury Performance cars.  In some respects the S3 doesn't represent that ideal as much as the marketing materials proclaim.  If you have an S3 and love it -- I congratulate you and do understand how you could be justified in feeling that way.  This long-time Audi maven, however, thinks the S3 should be sent, IMMEDIATELY, to finishing school or that the price should be cut about 15%. Being quicker than an S4 just isn't enough.  DILYL"
1224,"October 23, 2015  6:05PM",tlong,"When I sat in the A3 sedan, it felt kind of like a ""nice car that was cheap"" if that makes any sense. (referring to quality as opposed to price). My 1998 A4 was about the same size as the current A3 sedan but the older A4 was a much nicer car inside.  Alternatively, when I sit in something like a current Mazda 3 that is loaded, it feels like a ""cheap car that's really nice"".  I actually think I prefer the latter. So I get what you are saying about the S3 vs. S4. It's not just about speed, it's also about quality and refinement.  People who want speed, alone, can get a Mustang or a Subaru WRX and forget the refinement. Supposedly you go to Audi for some luxury and refinement as well. So yes, the A3/S3 seems a bit like a cheapening of the brand, just like the new baby Mercedes. Moving downscale to try and get a different audience, but in the long term do these types of vehicles damage their brands, and are they really luxury (even entry level) any more?"

1229,"October 23, 2015  7:25PM",markcincinnati," Point taken, but my sense is that the S3 was, much more of an economy class vehicle -- hence my remark that this freshman effort might have been better if it had come out from the VW side of the house. Even a sub-$50K S4 has a substantially more solid feel; and the look at the interior one enjoys and can touch and feel from behind the wheel is, well, Premium.  I like the phrase: ""cheap car that's really nice"" -- unfortunately, I can't say I thought the feel of the S3 was in keeping with the rest of the Audi lineup we get here in the US.  I read an article about the ways mfgrs approach cutting costs -- one of the mentioned ways was that a car company can elect to make the surfaces you see, but don't touch often, much thinner or with a lower grade of whatever material the surface is made of; also the ""glove box"" can be made of a cardboard like material and so forth.  The S3 seemed much more like every ""trick"" in the book to drive cost down was used, much moreso than the other Audis and BMWs we have had since 1977. My 2014 S4, by contrast simply feels more substantial.  Now, then, I have not seen the upcoming B9 A4/S4 family coming in 2016; and, it is possible, certainly, that it may have adopted the wring cost out ""attitude"" the A3 family seems to have embraced. If so, more's the pity.  Also, the new ""el cheapo"" economy Mercedes (below the C class) seems, too, like a cheapening of the brand.  For these companies, I would suggest they look at a similar (failed) attempt to bring out ""lower cost"" representations of the brand by BMW.  I think I, too, would rather have ""a cheap car that's really nice"".  Perhaps Mercedes can't bring out a non-Mercedes brand, ""economy car,"" but Audi, I think, should have brought out the A3 as a nicer VW than a not-as-nice Audi.  In our market, Toyota got it and came out with the Lexus brand, Honda the Acura brand and Nissan the Infiniti brand. For years, too, GM saw the market approach that seemed to work was to ""always have another brand to aspire to"" starting with Chevy and topping out at Cadillac. I understand the Buick Regal GS is a very competent, ""nice"", car -- but I also believe GM doesn't have, in the Regal, a Cadillac ATS clone.  When the accountants (so it was said) started to rule the day, we started seeing badge engineering -- and while platform sharing does make some sense, taken to extremes, it can also sound the death knell for a previously great brand. Does anyone here really care that Ford dropped Mercury a few short years ago? There was, really, nothing special about them compared to their virtual twin Ford models. There was a time, however, that Mercury was different, some would say special, more special than a Ford.  Lincoln is probably still on the endangered species list for similar reasons. At least Cadillac, to name one, has differentiated itself from Chevy and Buick. Had it not, we could very well have started carving Cadillac's tombstone.  Mercedes and Audi, for example, may have started on a slippery slope as my attorney friends like to say.  Does Rolex make any ""economy class"" time pieces?"

You get better brakes, better suspension, better drivetrain and tuning. Most importantly, many of the engine components are beefed up and forged; so you can still tune your Golf R safely to 350 HP +/- for very little money. Whereas running 300 or more HP on a regular GTI by matching the turbo in the Golf R works, but can start to take away your durability and reliability. Also, the R is 3rd generation Haldex AWD."

Not my point as the same could be said about the focus st vs new focus r. The enthusiast will pay the premium- but in doing so you stil get the basics of both a regular golf and focus - same with a3/s3. Some of that is not all bad - but for the regular guy who's looking to go fast and both be comfortable would be disappointed in the details .

I'd bet money the rare flaws I found in the Mexican built Golfs/Sportwagens is non-existent in the German built R. Another big-time PLUS for the R in my book vs. other Golf's. That alone makes it not just ""another"" Golf to me.  I will say the DSG in the TDI Sportwagen is lazy. I would bet more money it doesn't have the same programming in the R.  As to what the Golf Sportwagen SE is missing vs. my S4:  1) HP, quickness, and speed. 2) Real Leather Interior (though I like the Pleather VW is using). R uses real leather seating surfaces. 3) It is smaller; though more utility possibilities and flexibility with hatch design. 4) Sportwagen doesn't have Audi Drive Adjustable settings for steering, exhaust, shifting, and other characteristics (comfort, auto, sport), but I think the R does. 5) The hatch doesn't open on its own with the push of a remote button like the S4 trunk. 6) Surprisingly, I think the Golf's do pretty much all have push-button start, rear-view cameras these days. 7) No electronic Parking brake on the Wagon SE (big handle still); though the R might?

So, you test the Cadillac, then a couple of minutes later be behind the wheel of a new Infiniti or Audi or BMW if you want.  With the MSRP of the Cadillac so close to that of the Lexus or BMW, etc, and with the ability to almost literally test drive several brands on any given Saturday, Cadillac probably seems -- at this point -- to be overpriced or for whatever reason is undervalued.  I just returned from a 4-day trade show in Las Vegas (at Caesars) and after the day's end I would walk down to the Forum Shops at Ceasars. I found several high-buck watch stores and one that carries many high-buck brands and some less expensive brands, too.  Seeing these watches, I thought about the Cadillac as I looked at the Tissot watch collection and then the Movado watch collection after having looked at the Rolex and MontBlanc watches.  Tissot makes some very nice watches that don't require a second mortgage -- I'd take a Tissot over a Seiko any day. But, once we get to, perhaps, over $1,500 to $2,000, Tissots just seem overpriced. At that price I can move to Movado, but once I get to over $2,000 to $2,500 for them, I start to think, Tag, MontBlanc or even Breitling despite the price jump. Somehow, the $4,995 MontBlanc, although expensive, doesn't seem as expensive as a $1,795 Tissot or $2,995 Movado. The Tags, too, can soar in price, but they don't actually seem out of line, even at $6,995 or higher.  Cadillac, today, may be Movado, in some cases, however, it may be perceived as a high-end Tissot. For me, that means, if I'm going to pay THAT much for a Cadillac, I might as well get an Audi, BMW or Mercedes -- and if I am on a budget and want a bunch of stuff (high content), well a Genesis starts looking as good as the Cadillac and priced appropriately. Genesis is Tissot, but can make you believe you got the Movado.  Cadillac today can't quite pull of making you believe you got the BMW -- other than the price you are asked to pay.  I'm just not in the market for a $4,995 Tissot.  The malls may be a great place to shop efficiently, but when Cadillac is in the lineup, it just seems -- at this juncture -- overpriced."
1239,"October 16, 2015  3:45PM",qbrozen,"I'm obviously in the ""undervalued"" camp. Although I did get a significant discount on my CTS, which pushed the decision very far in Caddy's favor, I did compare to BMW and Jag (never made it to the Benz dealer) and, since I value performance, preferred the Caddy. Even if it was the same cost, I would have thought the CTS the better car, although it is possible the steeper depreciation would have swayed me if not for the discount."
1240,"October 16, 2015  4:45PM",dino001,"Never been a big fan of Caddy's styling, but I always looked at a previous CTS Wagon as a ""far out there, maybe one day"" alternative. Graphic's problems ultimately crossed out it as a possibility and lack of a proper sports wagon, or other type of lift/hatchback (5-door of any kind that is not raised) does not help, either. I'm kind of stuck with 3- or 4- series, even if I wanted something else. E-class wagon is too big and too expensive for me at this time. Don'd care much for cladding on the Allroad. I may check out V60, but seems like it has pretty bad mileage in its proper ""R"" form (not to mention dealers don't have them - I may look at S60-R as a proxy). All others dropped out."
1241,"October 16, 2015  6:34PM",tlong,"  I think another compounding issue is that if the pricing is similar, the depreciation of Caddy is higher, so lease monthlies are going to be higher (that's my guess, I haven't checked). Since a lease is basically the financing of depreciation, the greater depreciation would actually make Caddy MORE expensive than those other brands, would it not, and is that actually the case? Or is GM basically reducing the price (effectively) by subsidizing the leases to remain at least at parity?"
1242,"October 16, 2015  7:03PM",qbrozen,"Make no mistake, the other luxo models depreciate steeply, too. I've lost about $13k-$14k on my CTS in the first year of ownership (only that low thanks to discount). A comparable 550i is down roughly $20k (assuming I could have gotten about $5k off, which I'm totally guessing at). They have to heavily subsidize their leases, too."
1243,"October 16, 2015  7:03PM",Michaell,"  I don't have any Cadillac lease numbers this month, so it's hard to say.  In the past, Cadillac has had pretty low MF as compared to MB, BMW, etc., so that helped on the lease payments. It's also important to remember that other brands artificially inflate the residual to make leasing more attractive - at the expense of having a car worth less than the buyout at the end of the lease.  If you think the lease numbers - especially residual value - are about reality, I'm here to refute that."
1244,"October 16, 2015  7:13PM",henryn," Which puts you at about $1100 or $1200 a month, just in depreciation. Ouch!!!  And compare that to your last new car, the Mustang GT, which practically cost zero in depreciation over .. what was it, 18 months, 24 months?"
1245,"October 16, 2015  7:49PM",andres3," Was that Mustang GT brand new? Hard to believe there wasn't depreciation on a ""new"" car."
1246,"October 16, 2015  7:56PM",qbrozen,"Mustang was new. It was about $4k over 18 mos.  As a percentage, the Stang was about 15% through 18 mos and the CTS about 26% through 10 mos."
1247,"October 16, 2015  9:13PM",flightnurse, Well GC got a hell of a discount on his CTS too. Best deal doesn't always mean best car.
1248,"October 16, 2015  9:17PM",flightnurse," BNW has issues with the 550, but the other models are holding better, but we all know that BMW over inflates their residual on the leases. But if you take a M3 and ATS V-Sport I'm sure the BMW will have a higher sale value, the same could be said with the M5 and CTS V Sport."
1249,"October 16, 2015 10:01PM",qbrozen," Like I said, I got what I thought was the best car for me... I just happened to get the best deal on it, too.  I do think the M3 does pretty well, but the M5 drops pretty fast at first (new 2014 started at $93k and is worth $68k trade now vs $64k and $50k, respectively, for the CTS-V). I know AMGs suffer. We'll have to see what happens with the ATS-V."

1251,"October 17, 2015  4:13AM",markcincinnati,"Most of the leases from the car companies themselves are sub-vented. The thing is, part of the formula is based on MSRP -- and while the mfgr can inflate the residual and reduce the money factor, the issue of the MSRP still makes certain calculations limited in outcome.  The good news,so to speak, is that these severely sub-vented leases make it possible to have a 5 series for a mo pay that one would think appropriate for a 3 series.  We did buy my wife's SQ5 and leased my S4; I put nothing down. As she approaches 50K miles she finds she cannot CPO the car, but can buy Audi extended mntce. I, on the other hand, can have my car CPO'd and buy the extended mntce. I'll have both low payments and a 100K warranty and prepaid mntce to 85K. By then I'll own the car outright and likely have been under mntce and warranty the whole time with a payment less than my wife's 66 month finance (which did require a down payment).  It is getting somewhat difficult to come up with a scenario where buy and hold is as attractive as lease and dump.  Our plan, unless new information changes things, is for me to buy my S4 off lease and for her to trade the SQ5 prior to 100K miles.  You know, my company just pays X amount every month for our IBM iSeries computer -- and every so often we get an upgrade to a newer faster bigger model. We'll be paying for the systems FOREVER but we'll always have full mntce and always have the latest and greatest computing power.  Maybe cars are like corporate computers. Line items on the budget -- X dollars per month, which seems to yield bigger and faster at every upgrade.  For $700+ (adjusted to keep pace with COL) per month forever, it appears I'll be able to have a new upgraded version of one of these ELLPS cars in perpetuity. That may seem not affordable at some point in time, and I know that time will likely come eventually. Mean time, it seems like keeping current with content and technology will be ""situation normal.""  Drive it like YOU live."
1252,"October 17, 2015  7:50AM",tlong," I suspect that's true in many cases - business deductions, or if you buy every 3 years or maybe even every 5.  Of course I'm a always over 100K kind of guy so buy and hold makes a lot more sense. I've had many cars over 100K and even over 150K. When I see people who've had like 20 cars in 30 years I'm amazed. I've been driving over 40 years and I'm on my 5th car!"
1253,"October 17, 2015  2:31PM",roadburner,"  I don't suffer from Shiny Object Syndrome, I buy cars I really like and hold on to them. 20 years in the case of the Club Sport, 13 years in the case of the Wrangler, and 8 years in the case of the MS3. That said, I've still owned 20 cars over my 42 years of driving. For my current 5 car fleet I budget $425 per month for maintenance and repairs- I guess that's really stupid- I should probably just lease 3 cars and make payments of upwards of $2100 month; that way I'd certainly save money."

1259,"October 19, 2015  5:03PM",markcincinnati,"Miscellaneous Topics  Is there a spreadsheet (that I don't have to create myself) available (on line) that allows the user to plug in numbers -- and make some assumptions regarding repair and mntce costs -- to come up with the ""cost of ownership"" for buying and holding (at least 5 years) vs leasing (for at least 3 years)? I'd appreciate a URL if anyone here knows of one.  I mentioned this before -- and it did have to do with a GM car in the spirit of full disclosure -- but my neighbor with 80K on his somewhat late model ""paid for"" Pontiac Bonneville was, according to him, making maintenance and repair payments that were not too far below his financing payments. He went ahead and got a new big-boy Dee-Lux CUV (Chevy) using the logic that if he was going to make payments on a crappy, unreliable, old car, why not make the same payments and be driving a new car with a warranty.  He also bought a super-nice Ford four door pickup truck (with what darn near looks like a car interior, only nicer) -- and plans to keep it until the wheels turn square. Perhaps Ford trucks are really hard to kill or wound.  Took my S4 in for the 35K service interval + a tire rotation last Thursday night; got an A7 with 5K miles on it; car was apparently a base model with 19"" wheels, winter package (F/R heated seats, steering wheel) and LED headlights. For all intents and purposes, the window sticker I found in the glove box bottom lined at $69K. The option packages did not include the upgraded sound system, but, oddly Nav and voice command and BT communications and WiFi hotspot were all included. It also had premium paint (a kind of crystal black). Perhaps Premium+ doesn't merit a separate line item (which I thought odd, since there was an A6 Prestige on the showroom floor).  The A7 was sublime -- library quiet, supple, smooth -- the thing oozed from point A to point B. As Col Potter once said, ""there aren't enough O's in smooth to describe it."" Of course he was talking about some very old scotch whisky as I recall.  The upgraded wheels and tires (with all-season designation) were probably on the car for styling purposes since the car lacked the sport suspension option. But I hoped the A7 would be a true Luxury Performance Sedan -- especially for nearly $70K.  In a straight line and at triple digit speeds, the car was, to repeat, sublime. However, I really could not find much of that German Taught feel I assumed would be present. Oh hell, the thing seemed very close to mushy, with ample body roll and, despite quick turn-in, a huge tendency toward understeer at any slightly above posted limits upon entering a curve or twisty section of highway.  I had been, previously, loaned an A6 with all of the sport option boxes checked off and it seemed much much better than the A7.  The thing sure was purty however -- but not nearly $10K more beautiful than a comparable A6 -- and driving it although not exactly a chore, was, hmm, rather a disappointment.  I was able to pull into the dealer in the A7 and five minutes later drive out in my S4 -- the main straight line difference was that the S4 is not quite as quiet as the A7, but everything else about the S4 -- from the sound system to the sound of the engine at full cry -- was superior.  Now, then, however, would I have the need to drive myself and 3 passengers on a 100 mile trip to Columbus, Louisville or Indianapolis, well the extra rear seat leg room of the A7 would be appreciated.  I guess the S cars have the power to spoil (me at least). I simply would not pay the extra $13K for a relatively stripped A7 -- and if they were both $57K, the S4 would still be my first choice. Makes me wonder how much better, even, the B9 S4 will be over the A7's.  Drive it like you live."

1291,"October  8, 2015  8:15PM",markcincinnati,"BMW reduces ED discount from 7% to 5%.  Does this mean that the discount that is offered a retail customer will be 5% off of MSRP or 5% off of the negotiated selling price at the US dealer?  At the time (late 2013), I got 6% off of the MSRP of a 2014 S4. My wife also got that percentage off of an SQ5 a couple of months later. These ""S"" cars are usually discounted less than the non-S versions, so we thought 6% off of US MSRP was a decent deal -- and we both got EXACTLY the car that we wanted, not the second color we would except, etc, but the exact cars we wanted.  Now, having said this, does this mean that it would actually be possible to pay MORE for a new BMW purchased through the ED program than it would cost to buy one from a dealer in the US for US delivery?  Or does it mean negotiate your best price and THEN take 5% off for ED?  My experience is that 5% is not all that hard to get from a US dealer, thus making the ED option less attractive with a reduction of 2%."
1292,"October  8, 2015  9:13PM",robr2,"The ED MSRP and Invoice is 7% and will be 5% less than the normal MSRP and Invoice price. It is possible to negotiate a better ED price on a BMW than the official prices as there is some profit left for the dealer.  It is quite possible to pay more for an ED car than taking a car in stock but some people feel the trip to the Welt in Munich is worth it.  My understanding is the discounts are as follows:  Audi - 5% BMW - 7% going to 5% Mercedes - 7% Porsche - 0% Volvo - 3-10%  All provide one night's hotel stay, 15 days of insurance, shipping back to the US, and airport transfers. Volvo adds 2 round trip air tickets and a tasty meatball meal in their cafe. Volvo even has tourist programs available that you can book at the same time. Right now, Volvo is also offering and extra $1000 discount in European deliveries."
1293,"October  8, 2015 10:22PM",dino001," Small additions/corrections:  1. Only BMW price is negotiable, others are set by manufacturer. In other words, BMW uses exactly the same invoice-to-retail scheme, just at lower levels. I think the difference comes from BMW using dealer same way to purchase the vehicle, whereas others may be using their dealers only to handle the paperwork (and purchase is direct from them). 2. BMW 7% (now going to 5%) discount on both invoice and retail price applies ONLY to the base price of each line (e.g. 328i, 335i, 535ix, etc.). All options (such as metallic paint, premium pack, nav, etc.) are priced at same level as US delivery. Destination charge (BMW loves advertising ""from"" without inclusion of those $900+, like we actually had an option of not paying it - I really hate that, it's unseemly) is also full US level, no discount. This makes the ""blended"" discount closer to 5.8-6.5% for more heavily optioned vehicles - now it will be just about 4-4.5%. 3. BMW DOES NOT include hotel stay, only transportation from the airport to the hotel downtown, or directly to BMW Welt. 4. BMW will feed you over the course of the day at BMW Welt in their cafeteria and you also get a talkien 20 euros credit or so in their restaurant (won't cover full meal, but will be OK to buy something with it). 4. X-models are made in the US for the entire world, thus are not eligible for ED. 5. I think Porsche may actually have a surcharge on the price, but I'm not sure about it.   I totally agree - the ED is not about the money discount, it's about the experience. We are still lucky here in the US to get anything. Canadians, or others (Brazilians, Europeans) get the BMW Welt delivery, but no discount."

1295,"October  8, 2015 10:51PM",dino001," Neither. The price is simply negotiated same way as it were US delivery, with ""ED MSRP"" and ""ED Invoice"" values being  NOW: ED Price (MSRP/Invoice) = US BASE Price (MSRP/Invoice)*0.93 + US OPTION price (MSRP/Invoice)+US Destination (same both levels);  SOON: ED Price (MSRP/Invoice) = US BASE Price (MSRP/Invoice)*0.95 + US OPTION price (MSRP/Invoice)+US Destination (same both)  Essentially the ED Invoice is what the dealer pays, whereas ED MSRP is what it sounds. You negotiate with the dealer where you hit within that spread. Values strongly depend on markets - some dealers don't even want to hear about discounting from ED MSRP (following theory of always preferring selling a unit from the lot rather than one not built yet). Unlike US deliveries, ED vehicles are not subject to allotments, training fee, or some other fees BMW may charge the dealers. Conversely, ED is not eligible for certain customer cash rebates (the disclaimers often specifically say that), such as those you may get by participating in their ""Drive"" events. I believe BMW Sports Club discount does apply."
1296,"October  9, 2015  1:06AM",flightnurse," Mark, the MSRP for a ED BMW is still lower then the ""regular"" MSRP, since the car is considered a used car to the US government and so the tax's are lower.  This is not new, news, I think I mentioned this in one my report. 2% is roughly less then a grand, it's known that 10% off regualr MSRP is the norm for a good ED price."

Hence the manufacturer saves those funds and passes that onto the consumer."
1299,"October  9, 2015  1:36PM",markcincinnati,"Someone said the dealer would rather sell off the lot than promote/sell a car not yet built. From the time I had purchased my 5th or 6th Audi -- and became friends with my dealer/owner -- he told me he would much rather have only ""test drive"" inventory, service loaner inventory and some used cars. He shared with me that ordered cars have some profit, whereas cars on the lot have less profit. He said he wished US customers were more like European customers, in that they order cars -- dealers are not for the purpose of inventory control, rather they are in the business of demand creation and demand fulfillment via taking orders.  Out of nearly three dozens Audis since 1977, my wife and I have only purchased one car off the lot, and that was a 1996 A6 (that we leased for 12 months) that we used until our 1997 A8 (which took nearly a year from order to delivery) came into the US.  I find buying off the lot to mean one thing -- compromise. You pay more and you often settle for something that is simply not exactly what you wanted.  I don't get the thought process of waking up one Saturday morning and saying to your spouse, ""let's go buy a car today."" Of course y'all must think me daft since I start buying my next car the day after I pick up my latest car -- test driving is a serious hobby for my wife and me, that is. We test drive cars for, perhaps, 36 months then we order one and pick it up 2-6 months later.  It is quite educational -- the test driving that is -- and it is low cost fun, to boot.

However, the reality of US customer and his/her need for instant gratification (whether it's cultural or induced from the past) and the dealers play into it by holding large inventories. So, once they have such inventories, they used large amount of capital and are paying interest for the financing, rent for the location, upkeep, electricity. The calculus changes - instant sell of a car from the stock means no more interest paid and more working capital for the next unit. Essentially, the incentives and motivation reversed in favor of the stock.  Upscale brands are straddling between those big volume stores, where if you say ""order"" you have them running from you screaming bloody murder, and uberluxury, where virtually every car is ordered (like Rolls Royce). They are walking the line between one type of customer, who want a car today and another, who want the car, but can wait, if needed.  Also, some people limit their choice to a color and perhaps couple of optional items (rest is not important), they focus on those plus price, others would rather walk on foot then get a car with a missing feature (or one feature too many)."

I ONCE got a black interior (and that was in an Acura TL) because the dealer discounted the car so seriously once he found out that I would walk out rather than have a black interior car. I got rid of this car as quickly as finances and family would allow -- I get inside of a black car and my mood darkens, my optimism vanishes, the interior seems so tiny, hot and constantly dusty.  Yet, you walk into the Audi dealer and there is this beautiful A6 3/0T Prestige, sport package, upsized wheels, and every functional and fun option man or god has created, all for the bargain basement price of $68K and the dealer ONLY has them with black interiors.  Have we become so uncreative, so bleak, so moribund that we can only ""see ourselves"" in black cars, gun-metal gray cars, white cars -- all with black on black on black interiors?  Now, as you know, I resent seeing a $ next to the color -- and ONLY black gloss or white gloss are free colors, but the interior options usually provide several no-charge options at least once Premium Package (which they all have) is included.  My dealer actually, now, has a lot of cars on the lot and on the ""overflow lot"" several miles away from the dealership. But they're all black, dark-silver, gray or gloss white -- most with the dreaded (by me) black leather interiors. Reminds me of:  ""And they're all made out of ticky-tacky; And they all look just the same.""  Black cars with black interiors must be the PC equivalent for cars these days -- well except they offend the hell out of me.  Oh gawd, have you, lately been invited to a fund-raiser at someone's country club (with valet parking)? We were invited to a fund-raiser to raise money for inner-city disadvantaged kids; ""business attire"" was specified, so you trot out the dark suit, tie and shiny shoes and pull up to the valet behind a line of black, gray, silver and white German cars (and the odd Lexus or Jaguar) all the while unable to suppress the lyrics: ""And they're all made out of ticky-tacky; And they all look just the same."" It was all for a good cause, but it certainly was a sad indictment of where we've come to.  I keep telling myself that I'll bite the bullet and pay for the paint color next time -- we'll just have to wait and see if I can actually pay extra for a paint color other than black or white.

Let's just say that VW has to pay $10B, not the $18B figure that is being used by some in the news. After all VW already thinks they're in for over $7B in expenses to get through this. Is it possible that this figure is but a fraction of the cost of not doing the crime in the first place?  There may be circumstances that are what might be called justifications for doing the wrong thing for the right reasons.

I keep looking for some logic, even if flawed that explains why any company would do such an expensive and dumb act.

We have a wave of outraged officials all over the world right now. I'm waiting for news that they actually knew about it (at least to some extent), but did nothing, because of their political agenda of ""save the planet's climate by giving everybody cancer"". This may take a while, as those interests are deeply entrenched. It simply didn't make sense to me that suddenly Hans, Pierre, or Giovanni the Public fell in love with diesels, not just cab drivers and fleet managers, even those individuals didn't travel nearly as much as those fleets. Something was amiss . I knew the incentives were in place, just didn't realize how aggressive those governments got into portraying gasoline as source of all evil and diesel as savior of the planet.  It's going to be interesting to watch."
1327,"September 24, 2015  1:37PM",markcincinnati,"One of the key comments -- and one that I agree with -- is that the advantages that diesel (engines) have over gasoline is/has diminished. The thing is, do we know how much we've seen the gasoline engines catch up with the diesel?  Clearly forced induction and small displacement engines have contributed to this. Now, or at least it would be fair to say ""soon"" we will have the ability to synthesize ""gasoline"" from termite (well sorta) waste and we just keep finding more and more ways to extract energy from the planet in many forms, including natural gas and shale, etc.  I saw another TV show -- which of course means it's true -- that said something to the effect that we have about 99 years worth of traditional fuels -- that we know of -- available to us (at present rates of consumption) in the US.  In 99 years, or even 59 years, I would assume we'll find ways to manufacture or harvest or extract energy from sources that today are too expensive or from sources that we currently aren't even aware of.  Perhaps diesel is done -- but, isn't it true that diesel contains more energy per drop and has (historically) been some 33% more efficient than gasoline. Moreover, with filters and converters and adblue, haven't we reduced pollution? Of course, perhaps this event will mark the turning point for the love affair Europe has had with diesel and the surging love affair Americans have started to have with it.  With the claimed ability to manufacture fuels from bio-substances (garbage, not food, hopefully) and with the claims that we will be able to figure out how to make fuel from water and make it affordable, maybe we've breathed new life into the internal combustion engine.  With respect to the ""reason"" for the lie postulated as ""VW didn't want their cars to have less pep and less MPGs if they had made the cars pollute less, it seems like a reason that still doesn't make sense.  The engines, mostly, where this cheat was perpetuated were the VW and/or Audi 2.0L, correct? Wouldn't it have been possible to apply the pollution corrective measures on a 2.2L engine to keep up the HP and torque and perhaps suffer an MPG or three drop?  Again, this seems like a pressure cooker left alone with the heat on high -- it was only a matter of time before the thing would blow up (spraying beans all over the place). How could anyone think this cheat would not be discovered? I guess I am amazed that it took this long for the ruse to be brought to the light of day.  So now these folks are all getting fired. My take is the people who ordered the cheat and the folks who were in a position to blow the whistle and didn't ought to face some PERSONAL consequences beyond being fired (with some kind of generous exit package one would imagine). Perhaps a ""programmer"" who wrote the lines of code could be spared, perhaps. But the programmer's manager who told him/her to write the code, should be in a ""you are personally liable"" position at least somewhat.  Did the board know?

It was a new CTS with a ""Landau"" roof and a bunch of chrome and ""gold"" bling. I assumed this car was a joke foisted upon someone for some unknown and sick reason.  As I pulled next to the driver -- an apparently older American (remember I am one myself) -- I became so mad at the dealer, not the driver, for making this CTS tacky by any 2015 standards I can think of. Can you imagine any Audi, BMW or Mercedes dealership gold plating the brightwork of one of their cars, let alone putting a fake leather roof cover on it? What's next coach lights?  I thought this kind of tackiness was perhaps at least a decade+ behind us.  Are there no ""rules and regulations"" that Cadillac dealers must comply with? I mean it is one thing to see a new Camry or Accord so, er, adorned, in fact, I expect Camry's to be tackily dressed. But, at this stage of the game, how is it that a Cadillac dealer slipped through the time-warp cracks falling back to th 80's or 70's?  I hurled.  I do not fault the senior citizen for their purchase, OK, I fault them a little bit, but how is it that some SW Ohio dealership in 2015 could even think this was a good thing for the brand?  The CTS and even the ATS would have been on my short list based on all of the positive praise the pros have lauded on it. Now, I just can't see myself even bothering to test drive one, knowing that there are such ""super tacky"" versions out there.  This dealer should be shot (metaphorically speaking)."

1353,"September 22, 2015 10:08PM",markcincinnati,"I've been reading and watching the TV biz channels as they pontificate on the meaning of all of this stuff. The current news is that this is a re-run; Cadillac did it (got fined) Ford did it, etc. Apparently 11M (VW's numbers) vehicles had this software installed. Well, Honda got caught a few years back -- same thing.  The list of ""who's done it"" seems to be much bigger than the current scandal.  This doesn't forgive any company -- and it is more serious than Hyundai fudging the MGPs of their cars or Acura claiming their cars had more HP than could be tested, and so on -- but the thing is, I have read (in car magazines) interviews, over the years, from top car company executives who have claimed the MPG and emissions requirements go ""to the practical limit"" of technology then go beyond what is known to be capable for any realistic sum of money.  Nothing said here is meant to forgive the lie.  However, isn't it possible -- in the current climate -- to find some ""objective"" engineers and/or scientists who could say ""here is what we are able to do TODAY at this price; here is what we're able to do TODAY at that price,"" and so forth. I understand if a Martin Winterkorn goes before ""the government"" and says ""this is what is possible at a cost of $xxx per car; and what you want us to do would cost ($xxxx) per car"" the government doubts the veracity of the remarks.  So, the government wants a car to emit this much pollution and go this far on a gallon of fuel (or whatever is used to power the vehicle); apparently it can't be done at a market acceptable price today. Then you factor in that CAFE often gives a pass to trucks, so the mfgr goes ahead and creates a 2-cylinder car with a cardboard back seat, no sound insulation and made with the lightest weight materials -- that are inexpensive -- known to the designers.  I guess it is possible to increase the EPA ratings in all of the good ways by making cars out of carbon fiber and unobtanium, and powering them with a fuel cell and a solar sail -- but, said cars will cost 300% of the traditionally built autos. So, you're $25,000 car will satisfy the EPA, etc, but, it will cost $75,000.  This, if at least in spirit is correct, is unworkable and for most folks unaffordable.  Again, this does not forgive lying, but I can only assume that the corporate thought process, since it keeps happening over and over, arrives at the conclusion that the cost of getting caught is less than the cost of [attempting] compliance. Since the cost of compliance is apparently, like unobtainium, simply too high to adopt.  Too big to fail? Who knows if VW is too big to fail -- but if the death of the VW enterprise is the eventual cost of this transgression and disregard for law, well, ""who's next?""  I would hope the regulated, rather than lie, make a convincing, compelling case in response to unreasonable and/or unaffordable legislative requirements.  Here is what I want: a car that accelerates to 60 in 3 seconds, gets over 75MPG, tops out at 155MPH, stops from 70MPH in 100 feet, holds 5 people and their luggage and costs $25,000. I have to assume this is like the old saw: you can have this product or service: fast, of high-quality or inexpensive -- pick two.  Seems to me the regulatory agencies, the world over, expect it to be ""pick three.""  We're not there, apparently, yet."
1354,"September 22, 2015 10:29PM",benjaminh,"According to an article I read somewhere, but can't find right now, someone with familiarity with emissions systems said it would have probably cost VW only $200-300 more per car to make them actually pass the test. Almost certainly they would have also gotten a couple of notches lower on the mpg and hp scales, but it could have been done.  The gov't is not asking for the impossible at this point. About 8 years from now, however, things get challenging with CAFE mpg standards. But with 8 more years of R & D on that front, who knows what improvements we'll see.  Many midsize cars sold for 2016 already meet the CAFE mpg requirements for c. 2021."
1355,"September 23, 2015 12:03AM",robr2,"@markcincinnati  Keep in mind that the emission, fuel economy, and safety standards are not decided in a vacuum. Manufacturers and their lobbyists work closely with the EPA and NHTSA to come up with achievable targets. The government knows they can't pick arbitrary standards that would make products so expensive that the average consumer couldn't buy them. It's all negotiated.  As for VW and the inability to meet the target, remember they are able to meet the target when the vehicle is in test mode. I'm guessing that performance, fuel economy, or cost targets could not be met without the test mode, hence the deception."
1356,"September 23, 2015  1:02AM",stickguy,"well, obviously they could make the cars pass the test. For no extra money, because they did pass the tests.  the problem isn't that they didn't pass, it is they essentially did a ""cheater"" tune job themselves (as opposed to owners that chip a car to get the same end result).  I assume the ""fix"" is just a flash update to make the test cheater tune the standard and only option.  I admit not having had time to read the articles about this. I have seen the ""up to 40x"" stuff (which i assume is worst case, not close to average). But is there decent reports on what the HP and MPG hit to running the ""test"" tune all the time would be?"

1360,"September 23, 2015 12:32PM",markcincinnati,"I am sitting here watching a TV show on the subject of the cost to make the cars in question compliant with their claims. The ""expert"" (I have no idea who he is, but he does not appear to be, currently at least, from a car mfgr), claims something like the cost per car to make them compliant is over $35,000 PER CAR. I don't even know of any Jettas that, new, retailed for that much.  Anyone who reads and/or watches conventional media knows that so many of these companies that try to get away with things, don't. Therefore, someone who measures risk must have come to the conclusion that the risk (cost) of the lie is lower than the risk (cost) of compliance. Why else would someone make such a decision, especially if the cost per car would be $200 or $300 as suggested here elsewhere?  Another news story claims, that ""as a practical matter,"" (which I assume is code for ""the cost of meeting the standards would make the cars in question unsellable"") there is no CURRENT way to meet these requirements.  Sure, discoveries are made every day, and I think it is reasonable to conclude that it is possible to get to zero emissions -- but diesel engines must make things more difficult and/or prohibitively expensive.  If I thought I could comply and simply pass the cost along to a willing market, why would I risk even the possibility of being caught fudging the numbers?  Something doesn't add up -- I mean why would Cadillac have done the same thing a few years ago, why would the other companies fudge HP or MPG ratings or not fix ignition switches (and in the case of ignition switches there was an inexpensive fix)?  I understand there are EPA haters, and of course there are car company haters, but time and again, when it is possible for a secret or cover up to be discovered, it is -- is, for example, Martin Winterkorn, a boob someone who doesn't read or watch TV where it is possible to see a peanut company exec go to jail for 28 years for trying to cover up tainted peanut butter, or GM being called out for faulty ignition switches or Cadillac being fined for cooking EPA compliance records?  Said it before, the only way to keep a secret between 3 people is if 2 of them are dead. How many people at VW knew? Did it not ever occur to anyone that a curious guy from the university of West Virginia (or where ever) would test one of these cars and uncover the deceit?  As somewhat of a student of Adam Smith, I'm not really sure if this is the invisible hand at work -- it seems more like the work of a statistician who advised (ill-advised, I'd say) management that the cost of compliance is far more dear than the cost of getting caught cheating.  I just missed what the President of Nissan was just saying in an interview, but it seems to be something like ""we all do it, because the costs of compliance are too dear.""  Wonder how this will all play out? At this point, I'm going with ""too big to fail.""  This too shall pass."

This, too, makes no sense to me -- diesel cars cost more than gas engined cars, so is it possible that buying a diesel Jetta for a not easy to ignore price premium vs a less expensive gas engined version hinged on the lack of the need to use ad-blue?  I guess it is possible that someone on a budget would spring for a diesel, but again, it doesn't seem as probable to me that someone would do that.  My issues with diesel, until quite recently, have been the scarcity of gas stations that also offer diesel. Now, I would see only positives to getting one of Audis new high performance diesels (which all require ad-blue).  My wife's boss has an ad-blue equipped diesel vehicle -- loves it, especially the tank range.  Me, I have an S4 with a sippy-cup gas tank that only allows, practically speaking, something over 350 miles between fill-ups. My wife's SQ5, on the other hand approaches 500 miles between fill ups."
1367,"September 23, 2015  7:03PM",benjaminh," My guess is that it wasn't ultimately the cost but the performance that was the real issue. It seems like it was probably c. $300 or less per car to meet the rules, but at the same time power would have been down by a bit, mpg would have been down a bit, and heavy adblue use would have raised the cost for the customer, weakening the case for trading in a gas car for a diesel given the premium of thousands of dollars over gas in msrp.  It seems like some people within VW thought the US rules were BS and didn't want to follow them. They wanted their cars to have better performance and better mpg by running their diesels ""naturally."" But the result was that the vehicles put out 5-40 times the pollution that they were allowed to by law. Diesel pollution has been scientifically proven to be harmful to human health, which is why CARB and then EPA established these rules to begin with.  So far it seems that BMW followed the rules, although perhaps that will prove to be optimistic. As a result, if that turns out to be the case, BMW's diesel vehicles cost more and get slightly lower mpg. There were probably people at BMW who cursed CARB as well, just like a few people here are, saying, ""those #&* bureaucrats!"" etc. But then BMW got down to work and got the job done.  Audi, apparently, followed VW down the bad rabbit hole when it came to the diesel A3."

Also, the total US number of cars affected is just south of 500K, globally it is 11M. If VW just thought the US EPA was BS, why cheat on the other 10.5M cars?  This, besides being illegal, unethical, bad behavior seems like such a boneheaded thing to have done, it is scary.  Everyone ALWAYS gets caught -- or at least history is replete with bad actors being caught over and over and over again. This current situation is similar to the behavior Cadillac was found to have been guilty of -- in their case the fine was $45M.  My thoughts: if you want a diesel car, you know it will cost more and, generally speaking not have quite the performance parameters we're used to in gas powered cars. Was the fudge factor in these small 2.0L engines so different with the ad-blue technology that folks would say, hell no, this thing's a dog?

Knowing how old diesels behaved, I knew that new ""superclean"", ""superquiet"" generation that we have now, had to come as at a significant expense. Common sense says that gasoline is much cleaner than diesel, yet the claims were the opposite, the numbers did not add up. I thought it was durability and maintenance and there were confirmations from the native markets of those cars, where there are systematic premature failures of double mass wheels, particulate filters and other parts. Essentially, it's been established by now that diesels are not expected to last any longer than gasoline engines as they used to and they actually may last shorter.

I may even pose a small conspiracy theory that many people at high levels knew what was going on, but kept quiet because of carbon emission policies running amok. Everybody wanted to show progress, so they kept blind eye on some things that contradicted official line. There were articles published before this scandal on emission levels in big cities over there and numbers simply didn't add up (the supposed reductions due to better standards, vs. actual levels).

It's almost never good time to buy right away after some truly company-specific adverse news with possible long-term consequences breaks out. It takes the market some time to price all the risks, scope the damage, also there will be initially enough people who will try to play it as ""opportunity"" without fully understanding the scope. The experience is, when one big bad news comes, there will be a lot of follow up stories that will create more and more concern. It's only when the pessimism reaches certain levels, way out of proportion to the actual damage, then it's time to buy. Usually months, sometimes longer. There is one important thing - the news must be really significant (potential 20 billion bucks levied by US government is important), legitimate (there are rumours, hoaxes, or embelishments happening all the time) and long-term (""more to follow"").  The market is about pricing today future earning streams of companies and possible risks to them. Most of the time, traders try to exaggerate every day news so they can make a bit of more money. However, there are days, when it may be the opposite. Sometimes, the right thing is simply stay away until the damage can be assessed and pessimism gets too high. Not just yet for VW, IMHO."

Make no mistake that this scandal is a huge deal. If the EPA’s allegations are true, VW knowingly broke the law with some of their most important products and could face severe financial and criminal penalties. And even in an era of recall after recall, Automotive News puts this well: “Compared with other run-ins between the EPA and automakers, VW’s alleged violation stands out in its brazenness.”  BTW, it seems that the scandal scope so far were the ""miracle"" engines that didn't require AdBlue urea injection systems, an expensive system present also on some of their models, as well as BMW, MB, etc. I remember them boasting how great it was that those engines didn't require those systems. Now we know why.  I can only see it getting worse. Once Europeans officials get the scent, this has a real potential of destroying the company altogether. Considering how many more diesels they sell over there, even much smaller penalty per car is still enormous.  No, it does not look like a good time to buy their stock."

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency doesn't test every new car for emissions complianceevery year. Most buyers don't know that, though, since the EPA's name is on the official ratings.  Instead, manufacturers ""self-certify"" and submit their data to the EPA. The agency tests about 15 percent of the new cars that go on sale each year, but it simply doesn't have the resources--in staff or in funds--to test every new car.  It's worth noting that in the wake of fuel-efficiency rating reductions by Hyundai and Kia, and then by Ford (twice), the EPA has said it will step up its verification and may require manufacturers to confirm their lab results with on-road testing.  But that's in the future. The VW trickery was discovered by a third party, which then passed it along a chain of contacts until it reached CARB and the EPA.  (We've heard through the grapevine that ICCT shared its results with a Detroit Three automaker, which was actually the tipster to the EPA, but we've not been able to verify that--so treat it as rumor until proven otherwise.)"

But, why is it such a big deal to feel the need to fudge these numbers? If the bright people at VW can't cut emissions without ad-blue, so what? I'm sure the answer will be ""the price of each car will increase a little to a lot, and that would be unacceptable to the shareholders since sales will obviously be hurt,"" Hmm, at a potential fine of $37,500 for each car involved -- there is no way it would've cost this much in additional MSRP with an associated decrease in units sold.

1411,"September 16, 2015  1:30AM",flightnurse,"So we left Beaune Wed morning about 9am, destination, Charles de Gaulle (GDC) airport, most of BMW drop off locations are at airports, we were scheduled to fly out of CDG, but the day before I found a much better flight out of London (Rick has a couple of ex-co workers now living in London) cancelled the original flights now book our new flights out of London Heathrow, all flights were booked on Frequent Flyer Miles, and one nice thing is when you cancel there is no charge, most airlines these days will charge you a ""close in"" fee if you book an award travel with in 2 weeks, however, since I have elite status with AA, that is waved for me.  We super slabbed it to CDG, nice thing about France is speed limit is 130Kph, which is about 80, But like any country people travel faster then that. I averaged 90mph. We arrived at CDG at 130pm, got he car washed, (US customs requires the car to be ""clean."" there is a carwash at CDG, 8 euro later car was clean. Now, if you have been to Paris you know he city is horrible to drive in, and the French are just crazy drivers (really look at their cars), however, the route I programmed took us to the outside of Paris and missed most of the traffic. About 30 minutes before getting to the airport, the windshield cracks, I did not hear a rock or something hit it. Luckily the insurance on the car (that BMW pays for) will replace it. We get to the drop off location of the car, sign the necessary paperwork, and we are done, we say good by to the car, wont see her for at least 2 weeks. Total 3127 K driven on this vacation.     Yes, there is a crack if you look in the middle of the photo     Farewell photo...    The Euro plates will stay on the car when it arrives at the Dealer, and the Dealer been instructed to leave the front plate on (AZ does not require a front plate.)  This trip was about bucket list items, so another one was to take the Eurostar to London, the company that we dropped the car off took us to Gare du Nord train startion which is in the heart of Paris, it was an interesting drive.. We made it in 40 minutes, lets just say the French just do not care who they piss off. We bought the tickets at the train station, and was on board minutes later, we got the last two seats together facing forward. When we got on the train, there was this french women sitting in one of our seats, the business class trains are set up with single seats on one side, and two seats on the other, the two seats are set up to seat facing each other, so two people facing the direction of travel and the other are not. We we arrived, in her very broken English she wanted us to take the other seats, we said no. We knew from the seat map when we bought the tickets 3 people were sitting here, not 4. Come to find out, she decided she didn't like her single seat, plus a friend of her was on the train and wanted our seats. so they can sit together. Now the other passenger arrives (older lady), then the cabin attendant. The single rider (older lady) sits where the young women was to have sat, but she was refusing to move, and wanted us to sit in the other seats. Rick doesn't like traveling backwards. We tell the cabin attended this and we wanted our original seats, the young women speak french (but I think she speaks English too) to the cabin attended, so we end up in this circle of language, I think look at the young women, and said, I knew you speak English, so stop playing games. I was right, she did, so she understood everything I was saying, which really pissed me off. So I told her that we wanted our seats we reserved, if she didn't like then go find another compartment to ride in. She refused to move, needless to day, she won to a point, we were just moved to the Business Select Premium cabin... Like I said before of the French, We can do this because we are French.. It's the attitude that really piss's me off.. Europstar trains and dirty, they are getting new trains, I hope they have WIFI...  We arrived in London about 7pm, Ricks friends picked us up and took us out to dinner, then to our hotel.  Conclusion  The whole trip we talked about how this car will invoke memories as long as we have it. This is really the only way to buy a car, BMW will allow you to keep your trade in until your car arrives, I'm sure Audi and MB will do the same thing. The only difference on our next one, in the fall of 2017, we wont visit to many cities...  Have been home now 6 days, and just got over the Jet Lag....  I'll call tomorrow and find out where the car is and if it has been assigned a ship yet, once I know the shipping line and name of the ship, we can track it's location..."

1413,"September 16, 2015  1:21PM",markcincinnati,"The new S4 has been announced and the details are impressive -- of course the question for the US market, as usual, are led by: When will this (or some very similar version) be coming to our shores? The timing, for me, would be calendar 2017 at the earliest, but sometimes Audi shoots itself in the foot (if you ax me) by delaying the really fun cars for at least a year. Of course, I just read there will be an RS3 coming, with 350 HP, etc, which makes me wonder if folks will look at a 356 HP S4 and shop it against the RS3.  Presumably, the S4 will be longer and wider, so perhaps the size, not the HP will mitigate and dilute the temptation to cross shop. Or perhaps the RS3 will be priced out of reach compared to the S4. Now, then, this makes me wonder if Audi may think it needs a non-avant RS4 to go up against BMW and Mercedes high zoot models (now that the RS5 is gone).  If history is repeated, the new S4 will not take a breathtaking leap up in MSRP, but will take more than an evolutionary leap in content and refinement.  2017 (calendar) could be a very exciting year indeed."

1418,"September 16, 2015  5:01PM",andres3," I heard the bad news that not only did someone at Audi make the horrific decision to de-content the new upcoming S4 with a slushy 8 speed ZF auto, but they also decided not to make the 6-speed manual an option.  If this is true, Audi should really just make the S4 with a CVT and call it a day since that would suit the customers this move is intended to impress.  If the manual was made available, and my '14 S4 was totaled in the near future (hope not, but hypothetically speaking), the lack of a DSG option would make me get the 6-speed manual if available, if I was getting another new S4.  Otherwise, hello Golf R!"

1420,"September 16, 2015  6:01PM",flightnurse,Car manufactures will never make everybody happy. I would assume too many customers complained about the driveablity of the DSG in normal traffic Enthusiasts will always lose out.
1421,"September 16, 2015  6:03PM",flightnurse," First it was a Subaru not a lexus, second with the devalue of his S4 his trade in value is less. The accident I'm sure is on his car fax."
1422,"September 16, 2015  6:48PM",markcincinnati," With all due respect and a showing of [my own] ignorance, I wonder what driveability issues are you referring to?  Given that both hardware and software components are in a state of constant revision, I can share some observations from the perspective of one who has a 2014 SQ5 (8-speed Tip) and a 2014 S4 (7-speed DSG) in captivity.  The programming of the Tip makes it the best iteration of the ""slush"" transmission -- as someone called it -- I've ever driven. The DSG is the smoothest transmission I've ever driven in that, when left in auto shift mode, the shifts are basically heard, not felt. I know the transmission has up-shifted by ear and by virtue of the drop of the tach needle, but the progression in feeling is unlike traditional torque converter auto transmissions and unlike manual transmissions. Both the Tip and the manual transmissions have a momentary disruption of forward momentum when the transmission decides to shift or when the driver depresses the clutch -- watching from the side, when either one of these transmissions is up-shifted, the heads of the driver and a front-seat passenger are momentarily ""thrown"" forward at the moment of the depression of the clutch or up-shift of the auto -- there is no such throwing or lurching with the DSG -- in fact in that ONE aspect, I would think the DSG could be said to be somewhat like a CVT. Somewhat, not much, but a little ""somewhat.""  Downshifting, again, is an area where the DSG excels -- when in full auto-mode ""S""port shifting program, the DSG transmission rev matches to the imminent downshift and the ""second"" clutch engages with virtually no kick. Only a manual transmission even comes close to this, but having said that, the DSG is so much smoother on a rev-matching down shift it isn't even close.  Now, I've driven the S4 (DSG), SQ5 (Tip) and S6 (DSG) equipped cars -- of the three, two of them are just that little bit better in terms of their shifting prowess and smoothness. Again, with all of the above subtleties stated for the record, it is apparent that someone at Audi (or whoever writes the software) has done everything they can to make virtually all of the ""dead giveaways"" that you are driving a Tip as invisible and imperceptible as possible. In short, unless you're really looking for HARD EVIDENCE that the SQ5 isn't a DSG, you might not really notice the SQ5 is not a DSG. Over time and with the availability (as I have) of two very very similar cars to drive back-to-back for comparison, well, you probably would be able to discern the subtle differences between the DSG and the Tip.  At this stage of my own posterior meter, I can tell the difference between the DSG and the Tip -- the Tip, NOT the DSG has some hint of drivability issues and even placing the Tip in ""S"" all of the time doesn't completely wipe out the ever-so-slight shift hesitation and shift lurch behaviors, although you really have to be paying attention to notice them.  I have not (yet) driven an RS7 -- frankly because I just don't think it is worth $120,000 (even if I had millions in the check book to do with as I please). I also don't think an S7 is worth $10,000 more than an S6 just for the body style. But I'm also the guy who resents an extra charge for ""paint"" beyond gloss black or gloss white.  I bring the RS7 up, not to reveal my proclivities and, er, cheapness for things such as pearl paint colors, but to remind anyone who needs to know, that Audi puts the very specially programmed 8-speed Tip in the RS7. Several reviews of the car noted their assumption that the RS7 transmission was another very fine implementation of the DSG; and, then, noting later in their review how virtually imperceptible the Tip is from the DSG as executed in the RS7.  Under full throttle in dynamic mode, both our S4 and SQ5 are prodigious accelerative forces of nature -- both of them emit the joyful ""PHLTTTBBB"" (aka fart sound) upon up-shift and when in S mode have quick paddle shift moves (but paddle-shifts are just a smidge quicker in the DSG, however).  Again, were the Audi folk to gift me (fat chance) a 2017 MY S4 Prestige 8-speed Tip with a torque vectoring rear differential and with red leather seats, I would be a happy man. Of course, this is based on my assumption that the hardware and especially the shifting software of the 2017 S4 Tip had continued to move it even closer to the characteristics of a DSG (which appears to be the programmers goal).  I have heard that the BMW implementation of the dual-clutch auto did indeed have driveability issues -- but I have only heard that the Audi and Porsche implementation and programming of the DSG have few, if any, critics.  What are the Audi DSG transmission issues?  And, why, if the DSG is not a fun, friendly transmission for daily driving, do they (the mfgrs) keep making the programming of the Tip versions as close to the feeling of a DSG as possible?"
1423,"September 16, 2015  9:54PM",andres3," I'd agree that Audi's implementation of DSG is spectacular both in 6-speed form in my '06 A3 (they mastered this 9 years ago at least), and in the 7-speed iteration of my S4. In D mode the S4 is smoother and more ""auto"" like than in the A3. To me, the tiny bit of lurching when coming to a stop is normal, I'm used to it, expect it, and don't notice it at all as such. I have heard that Audi did get some complaints with the early DSG's for not being very ""auto-smooth"" like. People didn't seem to understand it behaves more mechanical, more connected, and that it is a good thing as it is more like a manual in that sense. I don't mind feeling the shift under power.  I'm afraid this change has nothing to do with drive-ability or consumer feedback, but simply a bean counter telling Audi they can make xxx $$$ more per car by using a cheap transmission rather than the best but pricey DSG. This bean counter is in for a rude awakening when sales plummet. The new R8 gets Audi's best dual clutch transmission, so they have figured out how to make it work in very high HP and torque heavy monsters.  I think the review above comparing the very good 8-speed auto to DSG will echo a lot of other people's reviews of the ZF-8 speed tiptronic. It is good, but not quite as good as DSG. Progress going the wrong direction. Perhaps the mid-cycle refresh will correct the mistake, or it is Audi's way of raising the carrot to make people purchase the RS4 to get the right transmission."
1424,"September 16, 2015 10:08PM",andres3," Nope, @nyccarguy had it right; it was a Lexus RX 350 to clobbered the front right end of my S4. I was shopping Subaru when the wife was looking for a new automobile recently; they lost out to the Golf Sportwagen, with get this, DSG & TDI.  You know, other than the red paint looking terrible in 10 rather than 20 years, I'm not worried about the shoddy repair work anymore. The car has remained uber-reliable other than that one leaky coolant hose someone in Escondido, CA was probably responsible for.  I haven't found anything other than a loose child seat hook bracket cover to take it back in for warranty; I need something else to go wrong so I don't waste my time over a little black plastic trim piece in the back seat. I think at the track the other weekend with temps as high as 109 degrees I cooked the bright red S4 badge paint on the brake calipers, maybe I can claim ""finish paint"" warranty on it and get new calipers They are more of a smokey maroon now; though I haven't tried to clean them.  Being so reliable, I think I'll keep mine until it gives me reason to not do so, especially since it has been proven at least one S4 that @graphic_guy had was troublesome."
1425,"September 17, 2015  5:16PM",breld,"As someone who just recently purchased an S4, and chose the 6-speed manual over the DSG, I'll add that it was a difficult decision due to the DSG being so darned good. As others have pointed out, shifts are imperceptible, other than from an audible standpoint, which I liked. Now, I haven't been the biggest fan of it in some of our other cars (TT, A3), but I thought the particular application in the S4 was outstanding.  At the end of the day, I made my decision based on ""one last go"" with the manual. I appreciate that Audi still offers it on the outgoing model, and thought I'd take advantage of it. That was a significant reason why I don't have too much heartache over buying a model that I knew would be replaced in the short-term.  I suspect the manual won't be offered on the new model. When the S3 isn't offered with it, and they just took it away from the R8, I can't imagine why Audi would choose to offer it on the S4.  In any case, if I were to upgrade to the new model in the future, I don't think the 8-speed tip would deter me. I've had similar transmissions in previous cars (535, X3) and thought they were great."

In my opinion it is a car that does everything really well, still, I""d rather the choice be between a manual or DSG rather than an 8-speed Auto/Tip vs. CVT (for example).  If the 8-speed is a light unit; that's one consideration, but being 8-speeds; find it hard to believe the weight savings came from the tranny. Heard it's 254 lbs. lighter than the outgoing model; that's good progress!

1431,"September 18, 2015  3:53PM",breld,"If I recall correctly from the articles on the A4, that actually will come with the DSG as the sole transmission. With the upgraded 2.0T and the apparently improved driving dynamics, that should be very competitive in the segment."
1432,"September 18, 2015  8:28PM",markcincinnati," breld:  One can only hope you are correct. The DSG, of course, that I would expect would be the latest and greatest 7-speed DSG such as is offered as the optional (to the manual) transmission on the current S4. The press releases I have seen and have translated, however, claim the S4 will have the 8-speed Tip. Current A4 2.0T models come with the 8-speed Tip, but NOT the DSG 7-speed. Now, then, however, therefore, notwithstanding:  The current iteration of the S3 ONLY comes with a DSG transmission -- a 6-speed version. I assume there are factors that impact what is and what can be, but I have to assume the 7-speed DSG is heavier than the 6-speed DSG. What I don't know is if the 8-speed Tip is lighter than the 7-speed DSG, however.  I see no logic (marketing logic, which is as opposed to 'real' logic) in Audi offering US customers the A4 with a 6-speed DSG since most of the A4's sold in the US the past few years have been 8-speed Tips. I assume the number of takers on FWD A4's in the US is quite small, so for practical purposes, I will exclude them from my following remarks.  Many of those in the market (for an Audi A4) for the first time, are probably cross shoppers, shopping against BMW, Mercedes and perhaps even Acura, Infiniti and Lexus. In a world where ""more is better,"" I can only assume a new Audi A4 will receive a ding if it doesn't offer at least as many speeds as the cars it competes with. BMW 3's will soldier on with 8-speed ZF sourced transmissions, Acura will have, what, a NINE speed transmission? Mercedes 7-speed, Infiniti 7-speed, who knows if Lexus will, for the 2017 MY offer 6, 7, 8 or more speed automatics -- they've been having 6-speed units on the AWD versions and 8-speeds on the RWD cars, so, perhaps they have or will soon be upgrading to all 8-speeds or, who knows even more speeds?  The new shopper will HAVE to consider number of gears as a data point and if, for some reason, Audi chose to offer 6-speeds (DSG or not) while the other guys had 7, 8 or 9 speed units, I would think there would be some logic to the buyer saying, ""MORE is BETTER, so Audi is now not at the top of my list.""  I have not seen any evidence, and boo hoo (no sarcasm), it certainly appears that the DSG 7-speed will no longer be offered on the B9 Audis.  The only good news is that the 8-speed Tiptronic hardware and most especially software does continue to improve by imitating the DSG via a very expertly developed shift program. Said it before, I'm at least OK with the 8-speed Tip since it remains the best torque converter automatic I've yet driven.  ""Don't it always seem to go, that you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone?"" - J. Mitchell"
1433,"September 18, 2015  9:45PM",breld,"Just did a bit more research - it appears that the DSG (7-speed) will be offered on the FWD models on the upcoming A4, with the AWD models continuing with the 8-speed. That's according to a Consumer Reports article. I can't say that I've driven a FWD A4 - for some reason you can't find them here in Colorado - but I have to imagine that DSG is a nice upgrade over the CVT."
1434,"September 18, 2015 10:18PM",markcincinnati,"My 2₵: The Value of Allure  Our “highways” – well not all of our highways, roads and streets – used to be something most of us looked forward to embarking upon in our cars – even in what for most of us in hindsight were piece-of-crap cars; e.g., my first car – one of mom and dad’s two cars – was an early ‘60’s vintage VW beetle (the thing didn’t even have a gas gauge). Shortly after I got my license and had pretty much resigned myself to driving a 36HP stick shift car with a fabric sunroof and AM radio and a sort-of heater, dad traded ""up"" (?) for a Plymouth Valiant with a slant-6 engine and a “three on the tree” stick shift (and first gear was not synchronized). This four-door “babe repellent” also had an AM radio, but it was also equipped with factory A/C – which seemed odd for an otherwise stripped of all creature comforts vehicle.  I loved these cars – I knew they were pieces-of-crap, but I blocked that from my thoughts since these cars gave me freedom, tunes (on the AM) and what felt like unlimited mobility to drive from my bucolic and very sleepy, very little town (pop. 2,700 assuming everyone was home) north of Dayton, Ohio, to the big city (Dayton, if you’re wondering is still just barely a city in my opinion). Truth of the matter is that I rarely needed to drive the 50 mile round trip to Dayton, nor could I regularly afford the 50₵ worth of Clark’s premium gas (Clark only sold premium gas at that time, if you’re wondering) required for such an adventurous outing.  Today, in contrast, our highways and byways now no longer symbolize [much] freedom, rather they are often seen as barriers to freedom:  “Well I left my job about 5 o'clock, it took fifteen minutes go three blocks, Just in time to stand in line with a freeway looking like a parking lot. Damn this traffic jam, how I hate to be late, it hurts my motor to go so slow. Damn this traffic jam, time I get home my supper'll be cold, damn this traffic jam.”  James Taylor  When my 16 year-old-self got behind the wheel, it was darn near magical, the car was a mechanical being, to be sure, but somehow I was able to anthropomorphize my steed (really, a 36HP VW Beetle was a steed, no kidding) – it became an extension of me, I was no longer driving a machine, I was driving art, it was so cool it was hot. Crank up the single-speaker AM radio until it distorted and back off the volume a quarter turn and carefully balance the “tone control” to pump out all the bass that piece-of-crap speaker could muster.  Everything was possible.  Now, I have to admit, as much as the VW Beetle was not exactly a babe magnet, well the Valiant was truly a babe repellent, even though I figured out how to double clutch the thing to make certain I didn’t “grind a pound” every time I shifted to first-gear. Even so, the Valiant still represented possibilities and made promises to me (that it virtually never kept, I must admit).  Still, everything was possible (in cars).  Sundays, dad always would say “Let’s go for a little ride”. Off we’d go: Mom, dad and me in the other family car, the ’63 Chrysler Newport with push-button transmission, power steering and power brakes and both front and rear AM radio speakers. This one had aftermarket A/C even though dad bought it brand new from the next not-as-little town over Chrysler-Plymouth dealer. Ah, a big V8 and torsion-quiet ride, big whitewalls, bias-ply tires and full wheel covers – chrome everywhere – bling! Someday this will be mine I thought.  This car would be a babe magnet, I was sure of it.  Today, some of us, probably most of us, have lost that sense of possibility when we get behind the wheel, after all most Americans are getting into appliances, machines that simply cannot be anthropomorphized; and we’re getting to roads that allow movement like a pig through a python. In fact, if the 16-year-old's on my street are any indication, the future drivers aren’t even interested in driving until mom and dad make them by telling them “We’re not going to continue being your taxi service any more”.  Then, the automobile gave us a sense of excitement, perhaps danger (benign danger, mostly, but we certainly thought we were baaaad dudes: ""Man, c'mon let's un-tuck our shirts and put masking tape over the word, 'root' on our root beer bottles"") – a sense that we were darn near outlaws, men (boys, really) without rules, barely a code, to constrain our freedoms. Woo hoo, “We're back in the saddle again”.  Today, we’re mostly left with a deteriorating highway infrastructure that really can be dangerous, but driving cars that are, if nothing else, certainly very much less deadly but mostly without any gravitational pull. The fact that a KIA (fill in the blank) or Toyota (fill in the blank) is quicker, faster, safer, almost pollution free (by comparison), comfortable as can be and will have power everything, possibly GPS and probably AM, FM, and Satellite Radio, plus CD, Bluetooth and iPhone connectivity for the iPod function doesn’t forgive the allure that even in “SE” guise these appliances lack. I mean, really, my piece-of-crap VW Beetle had more allure than many of the things that pass as cars today possess – combined.  Not many of us care either, as a glance or even a stare out of your office window to the highway below can attest. The cars go by and perhaps one in fifty is worth another second or two of your gaze. In a few short years, certainly less than a decade, the cars will be driving themselves about 75% of the time, because no one gives a damn. The cars lack allure. We’re over them. If there were unlimited mass-transit ""tubes"" that you could hop in and out of on a whim, well hell, why bother at all to go for another new Mazda or Chevy or Ford or Dodge (fill in the blank)? Nothing to see here, move along, you’ve got homes, let’s get to ‘em.  Those of us on the entry level (or Premium class) luxury performance board here know about allure – FN’s trip to Europe driving a new BMW (his BMW, not a rental), now that’s what we should all aspire to. We’re again on the precipice. Again? Yep, we’re about to lose something we’ve always had – the sense that our cars are an extension of ourselves, hand-in-glove, everything’s possible (when we're in our cars). Gone, too, is the romance of the “little ride” with our parents or with our children. The thrill (of the next time I get to drive) is gone (one hopes not forever) for many. The romance, nay, the sex-appeal of sliding in behind the wheel of your new Chevy Caprice almost has no contemporary analogy except for those who allow themselves at least a $50,000 car purchase.  Does it really take $50,000 to get allure? And, if so, how did it come to this? My father was a 6th grade math teacher, my mom a librarian, almost all cars purchased were “previously owned” (there were only 2 exceptions out of all the cars they ever bought that I can recall), yet “my” cars, my piece-of-crap cars were alluring, exciting, almost thrilling. I contend it is not necessary to spend $50,000 or more for an alluring car. I also contend that there are few car companies that realize they are killing or perhaps already have killed their future customers' interest in their products by not building alluring cars at virtually every price point. [Frankly, KIA may be one of the few exceptions despite my inclusion re: non-alluring and comments above.]  Now where did I put the keys to that Valiant?"

1437,"September 20, 2015  5:58PM",breld,"Nice write-up @markcincinnati. As a stepfather to a 17 year old, I've found it interesting how the acquisition of a driver's license and a car for teenagers these days seems far less significant (or even desirable) these days. What used to signify freedom and the ability to spend time with friends at times seems more of a chore for ""kids these days,"" who can simply ""interact"" with friends from the comfort of their own rooms via a screen.  And, to be fair, from the parents' point of view, and somewhat dependent on where you live, traffic congestion and road conditions create an environment that certainly makes me uncomfortable sending our teenagers out ""cruising.""  I agree there are plenty of alluring cars at all price levels. In fact, I think some of the most engaging vehicles are in the non-luxury, compact segment. Hence, my recent ownership of a Mazda3, replacing a mid-size luxury car.  Unfortunately, it seems the luxury makes have started reserving the sportier, more engaging experience for the upper-end niche sport models. Whereas previous models of a 328i could provide a very engaging drive (and a manual for that matter), it seems you have to step up to an M3 now to get something as dynamic.  So, ALL price levels? I don't know - I think there's something missing in the middle. Compacts such as my previous Mazda3, a Civic Si, WRX, the BRZ, etc. are certainly engaging. But if you want to combine that with more refinement and some of the luxury trappings we enjoy, you have to step up to the other end of the spectrum. Hence, my replacement of the Mazda3 with the S4."
1438,"September 20, 2015  7:00PM",markcincinnati,"I took a look, not a drive, a look, at the latest and greatest Mazda Miata which lists for a number beginning with a 2. Not sure I'd want a two seater (then again, if the kid and 3 or 4 of his friends can't get in all at once, maybe that would be less, er, distracting). But, the point is, this car seems to be ONE of the exceptions to the ""no alluring cars"" comments I made above. Also, there are a couple of VW's that seem to have some sizzle to them.  The thing is, it seems a lot of folks (of all ages) seem to think the market has very few noteworthy cars until the MSRP gets to a breathtaking number.  How is it possible for some to and most not? Perhaps we've come to a place where differentiation is either not appreciated nor demanded by the market.  The thrill (could be) is gone.  That I can go out and get an S4 or something else comparable is all well and good -- but overall the folks today, upcoming, seem to actually WANT to live in their rooms or their parent's basements.. For me, at age 16, I wanted to go see the world (within about a 25 mile radius at least), without mom and dad, and the car afforded me with that ability.  My wife, an attorney for a Fortune 1000 firm, and her attorney buddies even name their cars -- do 16, 17 18 year olds do that anymore?  I must admit, I find it refreshing to know that for some the thrill is alive and well.  My wife says (about her SQ5) "". . .every mile's a smile.""

And first thing she did when we replaced it with the VW was think up a new name for it.  she also couldn't wait to get a car, and loves to drive (the act, not just going someplace). Maybe she is a throwback? She did pick a college 8 hours away, and has zero expressed desire to move back in here long term after graduation!  My son is also majorly hooked now on German iron after getting his Jetta. got about 16 months left on his lease, and has already been researching the replacement (likely and A3, unless he gets a better paying job and springs for an S3!).  could also just be genetics at work?

1443,"September  5, 2015  1:30PM",robr2," And that is why the French don't like Americans. Most don't even bother to try to speak in French instead expecting everyone else to speak English. Well guess what - they do but they appreciate your faulting attempt to speak their language. Once you start to ""embarrass"" yourself they will speak with you in English. It's called courtesy. How would you feel if a tourist came up to you in Cincinnati and started speaking in French without even an attempt to speak English? I'm guessing the same as that waiter.  When I travel to Quebec, my limited French gets a smile and a hearty English reply."
1444,"September  5, 2015  2:30PM",dino001,"These sensitivities can run very deep and show up in surprising places. For example, in Belgium there are Flemish (Dutch) speekers and French Wallons. Brussels is a French speaking enclave in the middle of Flanders, the locals feel the have been ""invaded"" by French speakers, both government and European Union officials. You can imagine the Flemish not appreciating that. It is considered polite there (at least by the Flemish) that when you want to communicate in French, you ASK if they speak French. They do, but they want to be asked.  Similar thing goes in some post Soviet Union countries. They all are working very hard building their national identities, often overcompensating. Most speak Russian, but they again have to be asked."

As for the ""surly French"" - I've heard that same comment from many Americans of varied backgrounds who've visited France. My opinion is if it wasn't for Americans like my late father who participated in D-Day they would be speaking German now. And my late Aunt told that to a surly sales person she had an unpleasant interaction with in Paris. God Bless America!!  FN, thank you so much for going to the trouble of posting your travels and pics. Very enjoyable and enlightening."
1447,"September  5, 2015  4:28PM",dino001," Here is the thing - those bailouts create resentments, especially when you consider that France used to be a superpower, cultural and science center of the world. Until WW2 French was the language of cultural elites and scientists (most articles with scientific breakthroughs were published in French journals). All of it went away in just few years, after a humiliating defeat (France didn't put much longer resistance than half sized Poland, attacked from behind by Sovients). Reminding them about it is not helpful, it's kind of like this big kid from high school with good heart but no manners pulled you out of the school yard butt kicking and then every time he sees you, or visits your house, he loudly proclaims to everybody who can hear how much he sacrificed and how grateful you should be to him. BTW, this kid is now getting all the awards, accolades, you used to get, college scouts come to see him, not you, etc. You get the picture.  To be clear, I'm not trying to diminish your father's sacrifice, or Americas role in the War, or the fact that people in Europe should be grateful for it. I'm from the part if the world that had misfortune to be ""liberated' by the Red Army and I would trade with French in a second. However, you also need to understand the wounded pride, which resulted in irrational lashing out against the very people who don't deserve it, but are close and convenient. The best way to deal with it is shrug it off and not get too flustered. It's just ignorance. Also, you need to remember that while substantial sacrifice was made, USA was also by far the greatest beneficiary of the new world order after the War and the casualties suffered are not even in the same order of magnitude and devastation than those suffered by the Europeans. Average European sees America as a net beneficiary of the War and it's not an unfair view from the global perspective (grant you not necessarily you father's).  American soldier came, fought gallantly, often died or got wounded, but then came back to his country that was intact and stronger than ever. French, Polish, or even English soldier had to stay in their ruined country, rebuild it from ground up, sometimes starving in the process, often having his family decimated. Having those proportions being remember, you may find out much easier to get along, even with French."
1448,"September  5, 2015  4:50PM",jeffm5,"I don't mean to sound like an ""Ugly American"". It's just that you hear so many comments from Americans of all stripes about rude and boorish behavior from the French. Shame on any American who treats a French visitor rudely because they can't or won't speak English. Also shame on any American visiting France who feels they are entitled to special treatment because of what happened during WW II. I'm just asking for common courtesy."
1449,"September  5, 2015  4:58PM",dino001,"Agreed. There is no excuse for lack of courtesy, regardless if where you are. Then working in a service industry, it should be you way of life."
1450,"September  5, 2015  8:00PM",roadburner, I agree 100%. I just can't stand the French attitude; in contrast I love the Italians and they seem to love us- and we DEFEATED them...
1451,"September  5, 2015  8:53PM",markcincinnati,"I agree with the sentiments regarding civility, manners, rudeness, surliness, etc. I did take history in elementary, high-school and at Miami University. As a visitor in many European and Central European (I've not gone east of the Czech Republic or Poland) I have not ever felt I should be entitled to anything due to America's participation and help in past wars. I have Brussel-ian, Italian, Netherlandian and Luxemborgian (?) relatives. My relatives all speak at least three languages, the folks who live in The Haugue speak, Dutch, German, French, Italian and English.  The locals in Prague, universally seem to speak, in this order, Russian, German, English and Czech (some also add another language, either French, Polish or Italian). So many folks, however, seem to have a first goto language.  My point in some previous posts was the contrast between citizens of various countries -- the French were rude (at least some were); initially, I would not automatically assume they would know if we were British or Americans -- all the menus use the British flag to indicate which part of the menu is in English. I don't recall ever seeing the American flag in any country on a menu to indicate English translation here. I rarely told anyone where I was from, unless asked -- which the folks at Oktoberfest in Munich seem keen to know.  I don't think anyone I've ever known who has been to Europe goes there with anything less than a sense of awe and wonder at the beauty of the countrysides, the diversity of the cities (knowing that they are not 200 years old, but multiple times 200 years old). I know of no one travelling to a European destination, who has anything but a desire for a vacation -- it has never occurred to me to think too much about WWII, while visiting a European country, for instance, other than my trips to Poland (Krakow, Warsaw) where we went to the concentration camps, the salt mines. Then there was the trip to see old Warsaw which was lovingly restored after it was virtually leveled during the war. Even Prague which does have some remnants of Soviet occupation, seems much more of the now, not the then, so to speak.  I have been to Germany and Italy the most, and I have been to German museums which do put history on display -- the good, the bad and the pure evil that we all have learned about. In Amsterdam, I went to Ann Frank's house, which was also presented, er, ""objectively."" Been to Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin, too -- went to the museum, which again put some very unpleasant things on display. But the trip to the Doges Palace in Venice with the torture devices on display, is also quite eye opening.  I don't recall any resentment of the US on display anywhere -- the museums didn't editorialize or express regret, anger or, hmm, je ne sais quoi. I saw nothing that would encourage an American to somehow believe in their superiority. There were, generally speaking, no ugly Americans -- or even ignorant ones as were depicted in the Hepburn movie, set in Venice, ""Summertime.""  Continuing . . .  Took a tour of the Maginot Line, and my tour guide -- French -- made fun of France for ""how you say, a lame attempt to prevent the Germans from invading."" We did smile at his attempt at humor, but again, most of my two dozen+ trips to Europe have been as a guest in the [whatever] country, and I was pleased to be able to be a guest, in fact, I often was humbled by the locals as they were multi-lingual, whereas I was only able to speak a little German (I took lessons for about three months back in the 20th Century). I expected very little out of the local folks I would interact with, other than a certain level of courtesy since they were, after all in the hospitality business; and I did not condescend to them.  Yet, go figure, the French sometimes seemed on the verge of being annoyed by our presence with the exception of those involved with customer service at very high buck restaurants and our hotel, the PARIS - LE GRAND ($500+ per night, 5 stars). BTW, the hotel is an oh wow experience. I loved it, but I would, knowing what I now know, never stay there again (since most of the time we were there, in our room, it was night and we were in the room with no lights on, sleeping; I can find a very nice place to sleep for less than half that amount (often 3 stars), in other words; if my goal was to just stay at the hotel, I might think differently, however.)  Anyway, FN has really come through for us all -- lots of great travel and adventure, great pics and of course some car talk. I, for one, would love to hear more about the car, the driving -- any positives, any surprises, overall impressions, any ""I wish it did this"" comments, etc. It is a BMW, after all, so I would expect it to do almost everything in fine fashion, but still. Hey FN, what features and options did you configure the thing with, and which ones are you most impressed by? Is this your first vehicle with Sat Nav, if not, how is BMW's interface in your opinion?  Back to some travel tips. . .  Far as I'm concerned, Paris should be on everyone's list -- at least once. I've been there several times and despite some surly service folks, I would go again in a heartbeat, even seeing the Mona Lisa, so far, has not gotten old. Darn thing is really tiny though.

1453,"September  5, 2015  9:46PM",flightnurse,"Mark, the car is basically fully loaded, that was the nice thing about about doing a ED, Now for 2016 BMW has made major changes to the 3 series, but the GT and 4 series car's haven't gotten the ""styling"" changes like the sedan, but other ""changes"" they have. ALL 3 series and 4 series cars come with sport suspension as standard, as well as sport seats, NOW, for some odd reason, BMWNA does not think the north american x-drive cars should have the sport suspension, doesn't matter if you get the M sport package or Sport.. So the trick to is order the Dynamic handling package, and had the same time you can order the M Adaptive Suspension (think GM's magnetic ride.) So with those two options the DHP is only 1K and the M Adaptive Suspension was only $700 your x-drive will have the moves of RWD cars. So with that, we also got the Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC), Tech package (we love the heads up display) Drivers assistance package, Auto High beams, Alarms is standard for 2016. So we have 2500KM on the car, I love the ACC, but I wish there was a way to turn the adaptive part off, here in France if the french see the slightest opening between you and the car in front they will merge right over so the adaptive part of the cruise leaves about 8 car lengths so of course the french moves right in, so what does that do, slows the car down even more, because it now has to leave more room between you and the car in front...  GPS, it's interesting, give you an example, when we left Marseilles for Beaune, we programmed the new hotel into the GPS, We first used the address of the hotel, the GPS couldn't find it, so we used google and found it that way. At times the GPS gets confused (like some women when they drive) and the directional pointer on the Nav screen will just spin around and it's not giving me a direction in which to go. This has happened a couple of time far, I'm hoping that problem will go away once the car hits north american soil..  Lighting package, the 3 series get LED lights, we have Xenon, which are adaptive. The Auto High Beams are nice, I believe I can get the Euro High beams coded in the car, in which one of the high beams will go to normal lights and the other high beam stays on.  Heated Seats, haven't tried them out yet..  Side and Top Camera's, we have a 360 degree view of the outside of the car, cool feature.  Premium Package, I love the Comfort Access, lots of cool features can be coded into the car, but you have to have Comfort access to do it.  So all F3X cars have a toggle switch to go between Eco-Pro (boring setting, it's to help save gas) Comfort, Sport and Sport+, since we have the SAT (Sport Automatic Transmission standard BTW) we gained Sport+. Sport + allows for the some of the elec nannies to turned off or not interfere so quickly. Now my 320 has the same toggle switch, before I got my car ""coded"" to activate the SAT, when I would go from Comfort to sport the only thing that really changed was the throttle setting, it was more sensitive in sport. The GT with X drive handles wonderful, when we were in Lake Como, it was raining very hard, and at times I tried to get the car side ways, had it in Sport and it would not do it.  Sport Seats, I haven't had much time to play with them, they are comfortable but could use some more adjustments..  Over all I like the car, we went back and forth on getting the 328 or the 335, part of me wish's we got the 335i, it's all all about the power..  At the Welt, I sat in the rear seat, MAN talk about room, and the seat in front of me was positioned for me...  We are averaging 24 with the car, which I don't think it so bad since we are averaging about 90 on the highways..  The Drive today was to have taken 4 hours but ended up being 8.5, lots of traffic and a problem at one of the toll intersection...  Night all..  FN"

At this point, it may be too soon for you to have reached the conclusion that we have, with respect to th around/top view cameras, but after living with my wife's Infiniti with that featire, it should be standard eqiupment (on all cars), I would imagine insurance claims and costs would decrease especially from parking lot fender-benders. Cool tech, IMO right up there with ESP and ABS.  Sounds like you have a super-nice Bimmer, congrats on that!

1456,"September 12, 2015  4:19PM",flightnurse,"Howdy group sorry about the silence, we are back in the states, so I can finish this photo log.  So we drove from Marseilles France to Beaune (pronounced Bone), France. So why Beanue, France, Beaune is the wine capital of Burgundy, all the top winery's are here, Rick is into wines, and he wanted to come here. The drive up took longer then expected. We ended up getting caught up in a traffic jam at one of the toll booth's, the machine wouldn't take people's credit cards... That was a mess.. The photos are few,  Typical small town/village in France              So you don't think I couldn't post a cool car photo. This car needs to be imported into the US, it's a CLS wagon, talk about Form over function, It is stunning in person.. This was the first one we saw parked, and had to take a photo of it.     Enjoy"

1463,"September 14, 2015  4:25AM",flightnurse,"So as I mentioned Beaune, France is in the heart of the Burgundy region of France. So the first day we just walked about Beaune, it's much bigger then what Rick and I assumed it was. Now, most towns in Europe are old, and Beaune is no different, we are talking settled right around 1440, so the charm of the city is the age, and how clean the city is. Besides being in the heart of the Burgundy region Beaune also is known for Hospices de Beaune which was founded in 1442, it's an amazing place, hospice holds a special place in my heart. So sit back and enjoy the photos of the city."
1464,"September 15, 2015  3:05PM",flightnurse,"When we arrived in Beaune (Sat evening) at the resort we stayed at, Rick asked me, ""So, when we doing the winery tours?""... Ummm, Winery tours... I guess I forgot to book that.. You can't come to the heart of Burgundy country and not go on wine tours.. Now the walk of shame to the concierges as this is going to cost me.... Dearly... Spoke to the concierges, told him what we were looking for, he nodded, and said he knew what to do... Oh lord, this will cost me.. Fast forward to Sunday morning, the same concierges informed us that he has us booked, cost 500 euro for the both of, and it's a PVT tour.. I knew it was going to cost me..  So monday morning at 0900 on the dot a black Audi A8L pulls up and the driver, David, walks in and introduces himself to me, mind you, never meet the guy before. Introduces himself to Rick, and off we go.        Ok, this is how one travels around wine country in France. David was great, and if anyone wants his contact info, please let me know. He worked in a few wineries around Beaune, knows a lot of people, he was able to get us into all the wineries for free and in before the crowds arrived. Very knowledgeable person and personable.  First up was Chateau de Pommard          The tour was great, we were taken down below where the wine is stored, very interesting and educational.      After aging in the oak barrels then the wine is bottled, then stacked.      After the tour it was tasting time        Don't ask how much we bought... Interesting note, doesn't matter what winery we were at shipping cost to the US was the same..."
1465,"September 15, 2015  3:46PM",flightnurse,"Second winery Chassagne-Montrachet  This is a smaller family winery, however, they product some excellent wines.  It was harvest time in Burgundy so the grapes were flowing, we were shown around the winery by the owner and explained the whole process.           So many of us remember Lucy crushing grapes with her feet, well, they don't do that anymore, they have machines for that.      The machine rotates and crushes the grapes and the juice flows down.    Crushed grapes     Jucie from the crushed grapes, yeah look bad, but tasted good. Once they are done crushing the grapes, they are placed in huge vats and all the sediments settle to the bottom, this is done 3 times before the juice is places into oak barrels to ferment.   Here is a map of the area where the winery is at, each color represent different types of grapes, one thing I learned was, the vast acres of grape vine we saw, are not all owned by just one company. The map show inside the vineyards small sections with lines in them, that indicated what this winery owns, as you can tell they are scarred all over the place. This is how it is done in France.     Grapes that just arrived, and was picked about an hour before the photo was taken, yes, they were very sweet tasting.    Father and Son loading the crusher for next batch.       Next we stopped by one of the most famous and most expensive wine makers in the Burgundy region Romnee Conti average bottle of wine from this winery is $300 US. and no we didn't buy anything here..        Next we went to Chateau Du Clos De Vougeot, The Clos de Vougeot vineyard was created by Cistercian monks of Cîteaux Abbey in 12th century, this is the only vineyard that is ""enclosed"" by a rock wall, and that is still intact today as it was in the 12th century. I could go on about this place, but do a search on it, it's an amazing place.          Lastly we went to a very small winery, very interesting concept, the owner build a restaurant underground that features food and wine from the area.      He also has a small collection of ""stuff""    Wine      More stuff     That was it for the tour, we were tired!! Had a great time and the A8L was awesome, I loved the message seat.. Now we get to wait for our wine to arrive.  Lastly off to Paris to drop the car off"

1470,"September  1, 2015  1:31PM",flightnurse," I don't think people really know why they moved over into another land most of the time, maybe just out of habit.  So driving over here is a treat, and the people really know how to drive, they do drive faster then posted speed limit even on ""B"" roads, but they are safe drivers. You do not see them texting, or talking on the Cellphone, or putting make up on while driving, plus on ""B"" roads there are bike all over the place.. It amazing to see how many bike share the road. Now, no bikes are allowed on ""A"" roads. ""A"" roads would be like major highway, ""B"" roads are just that the back roads. But people are very focused on driving, when we came into Solvenia, you wouldn't have known, the roads are in excellent condition, smooth as silk.  So we are in Italy, the A2 Autostrada was fast and smooth, car is passed the 1200 mile point and now we can open her up. had it up 135mph rock steady. more on that later time for some cappuccino..  ciao bella"
1471,"September  1, 2015  9:22PM",flightnurse,"So it's 1045pm had a great day, we are staying in Erbusco Italy, it's about 20 miles east of Bergamo, where my surname is from, going to meet cousins I have never meet before.. We are staying in a place called L'Alberete it's a hotel right in the middle of wine country, the views are breathtaking.  So to catch you up on the driving from yesterday, we left Salzburg to go to Lake Hallstatt, what a place, and the tourist love it. It's also home to one of the biggest salt mines in Austria. The Drive there was about 2 hours, nothing to really report, ate lunch hung around and left, about 2pm. Now this is where it gets weird, we I put the info into the Nav system to get us to Ljubljana, Solvenia I told it NOT to take toll road or highway. This was a big mistake. The Nav system said it was about 200 KM away, and said we would arrive about 6pm, About two hours into the drive I noticed the time to arrive keep getting longer, I went back into the nav system and saw what was chosen as the route all ""B"" roads.. I fixed this but we were so far buried into the ALPS it didn't matter, we saw some great places, then we came upon a accident. After sitting for about 30 minutes, one of the fireman came up and told us we can wait 2-3 hours before it is cleared or we can turn around and take the ""detour"", when I asked him about this detour he couldn't answer the question, mind you the Nav gave us an alternate routes but we had to go forward about 20km before they took effect (that wasn't going to work.) so we turned around and followed people who were just as lost, but they spoke German. We got a gas station and asked someone there, they gave us direction and found the detour,once we got half way through the detour we turn the Nav back on and found us a route to get moving. But this route, routed us OVER the ALPS, we hit the highest point of 1765 meters (close to 6K ft) we finally got into Slovenia, and arrived at are hotel about 815pm, about 2 hours later then we wanted.. Ljubljana is a wonderful city, we hit the town about 845 for dinner, we were supised on how many people were walking about, we were by the river that splints the city in town. Lots of history there and we both want to go back. It's a very modern city.  Salzburg has large elect bus network, but you have to see this mess all over the place.    Austria, like German have a lot of lakes, this is just one of them. Here we meet a daughter and father who were riding bikes from Munich to Lake Halstatt they are on holiday..    Hatchback and Wagons are all over the place in Germany and Austria, this has to be one of the more popular models around Europe, I would day 90% of them are diesels I saw many 118d or 120d's. BMW also makes this as a 3 door hatch, also the A3 5 door (the one we get) as well as the A1 is very popular, and most are oil burners.    First real photos of the car in bright sunlight the blue look amazing..       The 3 series has a mid-life cycle for 2016, but the GT and 4 series do not get one, however, both the GT and 4 series have received some updates that the 3 series gets. First the Rims, these have more of a grey tone to them less silver, also the middle consul and AC controls are different and lastly, the rear exhaust is black not silver this photo shows the rear exhaust.    The next two are in Lake Hallstatt, truly an amazing place.      Last is a shot of a town we detoured through, got to love iPhones and GPS, I had no idea the name of this town, but when you take a photo with the phone it says the GPS coordinates and will stamp the photo with the name later on. The name of this town is Bad Aussee, it was really charming. BTW I don't think this town gets this many cars..."

1478,"September  2, 2015  6:25PM",nyccarguy,@flightnurse - your car looks sensational in Imperial Blue.  I like those wheels too.  Did you guys trade in Rick's Genesis?  Or do you do that when you get the car re-delivered?
1479,"September  2, 2015  6:28PM",markcincinnati,"Because they can . . .  Maybe this is old fashioned thinking.  It seems to me, if you're going to market your car with a choice of ten standard (non-custom) colors, the price should include the cost of the paint. When the customer requests a ""non-standard"" or custom color, well, whatever the traffic will allow should govern the price.  I've taken the tour through the Audi factory in Germany (6 times), and they are very proud of the part of the tour where you get to see the paint booth. There is a display near the paint facility that has the entire spectrum of available colors displayed as somewhat large paint chips (for the workers or the customers? to see). There were dozens of Audi colors apparently able to be specified -- I would call them non-custom.  I understand that Pearl Swirl Pink is probably not a color chosen often, ditto some fantastic purple swirl colors -- but, I assume the fact that they are ""on the wall"" means the factory just didn't make a one-off paint blend for a customer (perhaps Bentley does this, but I would not imagine Audi would not for $1,000, in other words.)  We're down to two (black gloss and white gloss) standard colors these days -- literally every other standard color costs extra. The Audi Exclusive line (should one venture into their paint pallet) costs even more on top of that.  It just irks me to be charged for something that shouldn't be a question. Silver is not a custom color, hell, even the purple infused black Audi calls Panther black justifies a $1,000+ optional add on. Pull the other one.  I know, I know, everyone does it and seems to get away with it -- and I do assume that some paint colors cost more to fabricate than others, but couldn't these companies just bury the cost in the base price and let the customer pick what they want. This is especially annoying since most folks don't order their cars, and therefore have no say.  Rare is the car on the lot that is gloss black -- the ones on the lot are pearl black or panther black or oolong black or whatever the name du jour is. But at anything over 10 feet away, they all look black and shiny.  Even the Ibis White (a free color) looks little, if any, different than the metallic white offered -- beyond 10 feet away.  I had no issue paying for a full-on leather interior (no alcantara, that is) for my S4, but I would have been miffed if leather was standard and yet RED leather was $1,000 upcharge. God help me if I wanted the leather in a non-standard color.  I'd gladly pay for a heated steering wheel or heated rear seats -- those options weren't available. But 'cmon, black or white paint or pay up? Luckily I am fine with white.  Now, my wife, on the other hand, just rolls with it and says, $1,075 for the color is OK.  I've watched the cars being painted, mostly it's done by robots -- does it really cost THAT much extra to get one in silver?  Roll up your arm and bend over!"

1484,"September  2, 2015  8:51PM",tlong," It's all marketing and revenue maximization. Show a lower base price, but then make sure everything is an upcharge. BMW has been doing this for decades, Audi (at least in the US) not as long but they are getting there more and more.  It's the same reason you can get a certain cell phone for some lower price but the base model has only 16Gb which is pretty minimal. Of course the upcharge to 32 or 64Mb is way out of proportion to the actual cost of those changes for the manufacturer. Instant profit!"

1486,"September  2, 2015  9:07PM",flightnurse," BMW has what they call Individual colors for both exterior and Interior leather colors, as well as Options, when you choose an Individual color the car gets painted at a different facility, so the added price is the while process. Now, the 3 GT is not built at the same factory as the 3 sedan, touring, 4 coupe and grand coupe. So for our GT to get painted mediterranean blue, the body would and parts would have to be taken off the assembly line, shipped to where the 3 series is built, painted and send back to the original factory for completion. BMWNA does not allow for Individual options on the 3 series in the US, but they are available for BMWAG customers.  We took the BMW factory tour this time and watch 3 series sedans and wagons being built, was very interesting to watch."
1487,"September  3, 2015  7:51AM",flightnurse,"So the trip from Slovenia to Erbusco Italy was a straight shot on the Autostrata, as we wanted to get to the resort we were staying at, it exceeded our expectation, it is nestled in the foothills of wine country of northern Italy, the resort is surrounded by grape vineyards, a perfect place to relax. Once we arrived, we just drove around the area to take in the sights.  Yesterday we went to Lake Como, now lake Como is shaped like an upside down Y, for me it's one of the most beautiful area's of Italy, when we left the resort it was gloomy and overcast, on the trip up we got hit with a very heavy downpour which cleaned the windshield of all bugs! We stopped in Varenna for lunch, then took the Ferry to Bellagio (yes, the hotel in Vegas is named after the city.) Then we drove home, but the rain had stopped but was still gloomy. Didn't matter the area is still beautiful.  Hotel in Varenna, just on the water.    Waiting for the Ferry to arrive, the Bently's owner saw our plates and asked where we were from, when I told him he stated he was jealous of what we North Americans can do with the ED.

My wife's family (from Columbus, Ohio) have an apartment in Venice (and they are so gracious as to give us the keys whenever we go), so we ALWAYS to to Venice. And, we do love Venice, but, to me, Venice is good for about 3-days before it gets on my last nerve, the place is just so crowded and, if possible, just keeps getting more and more commercial.  A short train ride from Venice, however, is Verona -- a city (well, town) that while certainly for the [German] tourists, retains walkability without pain, and, for my money has better restaurants, by far, than are widely available in Venice.  The ""oldest restaurant in Italy, Europe? the World?"" is in Verona -- it is called The 12 Apostles, and the food there bests even Tantris (Munich's best, I think). Apostles is built right on top of the original Roman road, and if you tip the manager, he'll take you to the basement which as a plexiglass floor allowing you to walk on the Roman road, more or less.  http://www.12apostoli.com/en/  Hmm, I'm seeing a pattern here -- I live to eat!

1490,"September  4, 2015  5:18PM",flightnurse,"So we drove from Erbusco to Marseilles France yesterday, we decided to just do the superslab and get there fast, well 8 hour fast..  So my impressions of Italian drivers, they aren't as reckless as you hear about, they follow most of the German or Austrian driving rules, 1) they only use the Right lane to pass, 2) they use their left turn signal if they want you to move over, and 3) yes, some are crazy.  So we are motoring down the A5 autostrata and come up to slower traffic so we slow down, then barreling down on us is a VW passat wagon (they are big in Italy) and yes, it's a TDI.. The VW driving is flashing his lights, turn signal on, looks pissed that I didn't move over, Once we clear traffic and people move over (this whole time VW driver is inch's from my bumper) I nail the gas (we have 2200km on the car) and wham, talk off. VW growing smaller and smaller in the mirror. Top out at 135mph, we reach slower traffic, VW own barreling down doing the same thing, flashing lights, turn signal, giving me the Italian salute, not too sure if it was a good one or bad one. Again, once traffic opens up, and people move up, I take off, and the VW gets smaller and smaller in the mirror. Again, top out at 135, reach slower traffic, again VW driver flashing lights and turn signal, this time once we clear traffic, I get in front of slower traffic and pulled over the right land (this A5 has 3 lane's in each direction) and the VW pulled up, it's quite funny, he can tell he has it floored but not moving so fast, I nail it get in front, and pull away. Had to slow down speed limit lowered to 110 kph. VW owner catch's up and passes me.. He finally got what he wanted. It's interesting that it doesn't matter what country they are from they all barrel down on you at warp drive then get stuck on your bumper like that is going to make the car in front go faster..  France  What to say about France, if you think the Germans have an aire of attitude, you need to come from France. The attitude is, we can do that because we are french... Merging traffic, they will pull in front of you if there is day light between you and the car in front, they don't care about their cars, well most french don't.  We stopped in Monaco, did the tourist thing, stopped in front f the Casino, and got a photo of the car, TALK ABOUT CROWDED!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The cars, WOW, the Cars, I got one photo of a Lambo, lots of make there too. The streets are narrow REALLY narrow.. Lots of construction going on and our GPS wasn't updated on this, so it took a little longer to get to the Casino, but we got there.  Marseilles  What to say about Marseilles, I didn't know much about the city except it was a port city. It's a very old city, and it shows, when you come in from the toll road, you come in through the slums, the GPS worked great, some of the streets we went down, were REALLY narrow,dirty, and stinky. Insane is a word that Rick used a lot....  My thoughts of Marseilles, lots of immigrants, usually from north Africa, lots of different cultures, Christians, Muslims and so on. Have seen some women in Burka's walking about here and all over Europe, the native people of Marseilles aren't happy with most of the immigrants. It's a very diverse city, the food says it all, more on that later.  So here are the photos from our trip to France..  In Italy they have rest stop's but nothing like what have in the US, the rest stop has gas, food and places to eat the food outside, and they are SUPERCLEAN... The next couple of photos is one place we stopped to get gas and something to munch on.              So we stopped at a French version of the roadside gas/convenience store what a big difference, the placed looked like it was about to be shutdown, hardly no drinks in the coolers, and the bathrooms look disgusting (this was the real reason why we stopped) see for yourself. A far cry from what the ones in Italy looked like,        So car's in Europe, we have seen some American cars over here, here is a photo of one that we had a good laugh at.     Monaco is supper clean, VERY clean in fact. Monaco is not a country, it is part of France, but it is a Principality, their license plates say, Principality of Monaco on them..         So I know you are all waiting for that Lambo photo, so here it is..    Traffic lights are interesting here, if you do not stop behind the crosswalks you will not see the traffic lights, but the French being The French have a fix....     Once again the GPS, she works well, she really does but at times I have to wonder, when we left Monaco, we put into the GPS the hotel address and said, the faster route, even toll roads, well..... For about 60 km we were on two lane country roads, then finally back on the toll roads.. She tries..    So I'll end this installment with a photo taken from our Balcony over looking the harbor and looking at the monument that is roughly 500 yrs old, it's a night photo.."

1497,"September  4, 2015  9:49PM",markcincinnati,"You commented about German, er, personalities then followed up with your observations about French personalities. Granted, my European travels have been entirely recreational, but I would say that only in 2 countries have I ever noted an attitude that was less than gracious. France (several times) and Switzerland once in Lucerne (come to think of it the person in Lucerne had a heavy French accent.)  The German people have always been friendly, polite, courteous and sometimes playful even. I've been to Oktoberfest about 6 times, and when going into a beer tent, you join a large group of people at a picnic table and within a few minutes it seems the folks are wanting to know about the US, US sports and are trying to teach us Americans some of the German-only songs that come up every 15 minutes or so between good ol' Rock and Roll. A gentleman and his father were in Munich for Oktoberfest and when they found out my wife was a lawyer, the older man bought my wife an order of peeled radishes (covered in salt) from one barrister to another. We had a great time. The folks on the subways in Munich, too, are always willing to help you figure out which stop will get you closest to your destination.  In France, on the other hand, we went to a bistro, like you see in the movies, in Paris and the waiter gave up his picture for the dictionary next to the word ""surly"". Apparently since tipping is not as serious as it is in the US, this waiter was actually pissed when we thanked him (in English) when he brought us our wine, beer and cheese saying (in heavily accented French) ""why can't you people even TRY to speak French?"" OK, well perhaps I could say merci, but other than asking ""how's the weather"" and saying ""I like chocolate ice cream"" I didn't think I wanted to embarrass myself or run the risk of butchering my communications (especially since the menu we were given was multi-lingual). How wude!  The staff at our (5-star) hotel in Paris was totally gracious and friendly, but my impression, from several interactions with the locals, was that they don't like us much -- or maybe they just don't like me. I went ahead and gave an American tip anyway, who knows if anything changed. The Italians were huggers and both-cheek kissers (didn't have that happen in Germany, but they were friendlier than the French.)  FN, I have no clue as to your age -- I am 63 -- I started going to Europe when I was about 20 years younger (and richer), but it can be done for not too much money, if you realize that most of the time you spend in a Hotel it is dark (meaning, 3-star hotels with air conditioning work just fine). Once I got over the sense that we needed 5 star hotels (because, well, you never know), we found we could see Europe for not much money (saving our coin for fine dining instead). Also, we don't use cabs anymore, we figure out how to use the trains and subways -- and for the long trips, we splurge on first class train travel if the distance is over 5 hours. Also became a fan of night trains with full size beds (saves on hotel bills too). My point is, unless you're much much older, I urge you to make this trip one of many, many more you should take. Benelux was a fun couple of trips -- Amsterdam, Brussles and Luxembourg city, do it again, do it again.  Anyway, you've taken me, at least, on a great vicarious trip with you two. My only regret is that you didn't get an Audi, but there's always next time.  Keep 'em coming.  Ciao (baby)."

The salesman offered to let the Service Department check out the ""misfire,"" but the new owner declined and happily drove away..."
1508,"August 30, 2015  9:42PM",markcincinnati,"In the mid-1980's, I owned an Audi (what else?) 5000CS turbo quattro, then Audi's top-of-the-line car. Manual transmission, power everything and a new to the market feature (and quite a rare feature on almost any car outside of an Audi, BMW or Mercedes) anti-lock brakes. For some reason I ordered the car with the optional wool covered sports seats, eschewing the standard leather treatments. But that’s not important to my warning and plea to anyone reading this.  This mid-80’s Audi had a permanently mounted voice controlled and activated cellular telephone. While driving, if I uttered the phrase “Turn on telephone” I could “Call home,” “Call office,” or recite a phone number – one number at a time, wait for the phone to repeat the number, and so on until the full number had been spoken, then dial. Hands free, eyes free. It was 1985.  My first Audi S6, a 1996 model was the next Audi I purchased that came with a factory phone (it was hidden in the arm-rest) permitting voice command. This version was updated and allowed me to recite the phone number in single digits without waiting for the phone to parrot my number back to me.  When I then purchased a new 1997 A8, I was somewhat amazed that it came pre-wired for a phone, but without a phone. Of course I ponied up for another voice activated phone. When I got my 2003 allroad it came with a special in-armrest holder for an Audi-branded phone and it also came with On*Star which was also a phone (voice activated) and an email client (that read my emails to me and also allowed me to send emails by speaking). My 2005 A6 was bluetooth equipped and came with a list of phones I could buy from several different providers and also had a special, in-armrest holder/charger that was invisible with the arm-rest cover closed.  My 2009 A4, 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD and my 2014 S4 also are equipped with bluetooth and they also have pig-tails for charging and [iPhone] music connectivity. Every one of these cars I mention, since 1985, has had hand and eyes free phone capability and ever improving voice command capabilities.  I finally have gotten around to keeping my iPhone in my breast pocket, but for years my iPhone often was in the trunk where I put my brief case. The phone works fine when it is in the trunk – and now, since I do use the phone for email and texting (after pulling over), I tend to keep the phone in the cabin.  Every few seconds or minutes someone has a crash or is killed and the “incident” (they are not accidents) causing the property damage or living being damage is attributed to texting or other mobile device distracted driving.  The technology exists to disallow talking and texting in a moving vehicle. I assume no challenge would exist to make the phone work if it is being used via bluetooth hand and eyes free initiation. The clock is ticking backwards, to zero, to a time when we will have no ability to use these communication’s devices in a moving car.  Here’s what confuses me: Since there had been some kind of hand and eyes free, voice-activated communications available since the mid-1980’s, how is it possible that I cannot drive more than one mile out of my rural subdivision without seeing someone driving their ELLPS (and I’ll keep it to ELLPS cars, even though such technology is hardly limited to the Premium class and above) with their phone held up to their ear (requiring one hand)? As I get closer to the Interstate and traffic density increases, I could probably throw a handful of rice into oncoming traffic and hit more cars than not whose drivers are holding their phones – and I am certain many of the rice grains would hit bluetooth equipped vehicles.  Before you respond, here’s another data point, most of the cars have one person in them – the driver.  I get my car serviced, I am provided with a loaner – before I pull out of the dealership, I pair my phone with the loaner’s Bluetooth – if I’m distracted, this takes 30 seconds. My wife actually has the service manager pair her phone with the loaner, figuring it’s part of the Audi Advantage (and the service writer always takes the 30 seconds to do this for her without issue).  I thought, way back there 30 years ago, “I can completely be focussed on driving this stick-shift turbo-charged ‘hot rod’ quattro thanks to my hands and eyes free cellular phone.” Is this technology not “way cool”? And, is this technology not a HUGE safety feature, right up there with seat belts, crumple zones, ESP and ABS, sealed beam headlights, disc brakes and so on?  I do want to be able to call home or the office without touching the phone, without looking at the phone and without pulling over and parking due to the inevitable governmental safety nanny. I want to delay yet another restriction brought on by my fellow drivers who opt for the most dangerous and deadly way I can think of to make a phone call.  Of course, maybe we’ll be allowed to used a phone in the car once cars start driving themselves. Mean time, I’d just like to advocate for voluntary cessation of in-car phone usage if it is not hand and eyes free.

1509,"August 31, 2015  8:06AM",flightnurse,"So just to chime on what is is saying about mobile phones, when I first got my job with Sony, I bought a Panasonic ""trans mobile"" phone. It was the size of text book, you could either mount it in the car or take it with you. OF course I thought I was cool at the time, that was until I got my first bill... After that I used it strictly for work. Mobile phones where just starting to make their way into cars, this was 1987."
1510,"August 31, 2015  8:27AM",flightnurse,"So more adventure with FN, Fussen to Salzburg.  The nav system on the BMW can be set to drive only on highways and toll roads or not, so this leg, we didn't want that, we wanted the scenic route, so we entered the address of where we were going to stay (Villa Trapp, you know the Von Trapp Family) and off we went, Rick and I both like the heads up display. About half way there Rick hit the ""mode"" button on the steering wheel and somehow reset our destination back to Ettal. I wasn't paying attention to this, About an hour later I noticed some of the area looks familiar then I noticed what happened on Nav screen. no problem, reprogram the Nav and off we go.  The country side is amazing, green as far as you can see, NO trash on the side of the roads, no billboards. On the back roads you get a lot of people on bikes, so you have to watch out for them. Overall Cars, motorcycles and bike get along well.  Fast forward arrive at Villa Trapp, looks wonderful outside, inside looked great too, but HOT, we checked in and get to our room, come to find out the room does not have AC, and the room was very hot, and no WiFi past the first floor. I started my Nurse Practitioner program, so I'm in school again so need to be connect. and the bed was a twin, I'm sorry we both wont fit in THAT bed. We go downstairs talk to the lady who checked us in and someone at the Hotel did make a mistake but they are all filled.. We declined got a refunded, I fired up my Sheraton app and booked on points at the Sheraton Salzburg for 12K points a night. When we arrived, the front desk agent told me we had been upgraded to the Presidential Suit, one of the perks for being a 150 night/ yr platinum member. Room is outstanding to say the least.  The photos in order, Small town/villeage    This was the first GT we have seen on our trip, it's a 318d.    In old Salzburg in one of the squares.    Up in the fort over looking Slazburg, too this with my iPhone in Panoramic mode.Over looking old salzburg and the River Salzburg.    At 1650m at Tageserlaubnisschen on our way to the Eagles Nets.

1514,"August 31, 2015  1:13PM",markcincinnati,"FN -- I don't know how everyone else feels, but I want you to know you cannot post too many pictures as far as I'm concerned.  I rented a MB in Munich (an E class) -- this was a few years ago -- and it had navigation. The entire thing was in German. Although it offered up arrows and the map, although in German, was easy enough to figure out. I actually got to know the word for left (turn) and for right, so we were able to use the system a great deal of the time. It got a little dicey in town, but when we put in a Hotel (name here) we mostly got close enough for jazz to it.  Is your navigation lady German or English speaking?"
1515,"August 31, 2015  1:50PM",markcincinnati,"???  Driver of a late model Lexus merges onto I-75 south, immediately moves to the left-most lane, slows to 50 (apparently setting cruise control) and using one free hand, starts holding the phone to his ear -- the conversation apparently goes on for many miles, although I broke protocol after a few miles and committed one of the most vile acts anyone can do behind the wheel . . . I passed on the right after my repeated attempts at turning on my left turn signal were ignored.  I'm all for most freedoms -- really. But, you can't yell fire in a theater (unless there really is one) and expect to be covered by the first amendment. I guess, technically, there is no reason you can't hop onto a major federal highway and drive in the left-most lane at 50 MPH (the speed limit here in Ohio has, in many places, now been bumped to 70); I also assume passing on the right side (or suicide) isn't illegal. But, and it pains me to say this, I would vote for laws that would disallow both of these behaviors, were such items placed on a ballot. But, then again, I am also in the minority that votes.  We're doomed.  Just another reason I can't imagine the frustration of owning/driving an RS7 or M5 or CTS-V, etc, where in wide wide world of sports can such machines be driven using more than a fraction of their engineer-imbued ""talents?"" Not that a Prius is all of a sudden looking good.  One more note - I would imagine that driving in Italy would be a free-for-all (and Rome, actually, is). But, other than perhaps a slight decrease in speed, the folks driving on the Italian Autobahn (the autostrada, as I recall), behave pretty much exactly like the Germans -- lane discipline, left lane to pass and the lanes get faster the further left you go, period. Folks respond to a wink of your turn signal to get over and, from what I can tell (other than in Rome) there is no road-rage.  Although many of our Interstate road surfaces are pock-marked, I generally think we have a well thought out (mostly) highway system here, that is rendered far less efficient that it could be by either ignorance, stupidity or lack of driver training. Instead, here, we rely, in this order, upon: Enforcement (sort of), Engineering (a somewhat distant second) and Education (a very distant third.) I would think we could drive faster, experience fewer delays, fewer hours lost per person, per year, etc, if we just made getting a driver's license require a bit more rigor. One would think, considering the death-rate, that getting a DL should require no less preparation and education than getting a pilot's license. My wife got her pilot's license before she was old enough to get a driver's license -- and she thinks that getting a DL is about like getting a box-top off of a box of Wheaties.  Something is wrong with that.  One last note: I love test driving all kinds of cars, despite my completely above-board bias toward Audis, German cars and European cars, generally. I have taken so many folks on test drives these past 5-10 years, I can't remember just how many. Not one (other than my wife) has ever had ABS engaged (that they know of -- although I wonder if they just don't know what ABS braking feels like); and the thing is, when I -- in a large deserted parking lot -- get them to engage ABS, the moment the pedal pulsing starts, they [so they say] instinctively know to release the brake to the point the pulsing stops.  I have been through 4-two day Audi Driving Experiences (on ice), 1-two day BMW Driving Experience (not on ice) one Porsche Driving Experience (1-day) and a Cadillac driving experience (also 1-day). Every instructor literally starts the training with the following exercise: accelerate to about 50MPH from a dead stop and when you reach the orange cone laying on its side at the end of the ""runway"" press the brake pedal ""as if"" this is a panic stop. To a man/woman instructor, the command is ""when the pulsing is felt through the pedal, press the brake as hard as your leg can press -- imagine your goal is to BEND THE BRAKE PEDAL.""  The reason given for this ""press harder"" instruction is always, ""braking force will continue to increase the harder you press, even with Brake Assist (which bases braking force somewhat on the speed at which the driver presses down)."" I've seen this impact myself on dry, wet and icy pavement.  Yet, when I try to get someone who is testing a new car to brake with any degree of urgency, the instant the pulsing is felt, they release the brake -- which, were this a real emergency could increase the probability of a crash.  We need to license drivers much, much more rigorously. And, despite this old fashion notion, I think knowing how to drive a manual transmission would be helpful too, much in the same way it is said that video games are helpful prerequisites for so many endeavors.  I happen to love my DSG transmission, but in a heartbeat, going back to a six-speed manual wouldn't be anything but fun.  We really are doomed!"
1516,"August 31, 2015  3:01PM",breld,"If I'm not mistaken, here in Colorado, you can get ticketed for driving in the left lane on the highway if you're not passing. I'm not so sure how much it is enforced, but I do like that the law is at least there."
1517,"August 31, 2015  3:22PM",robr2,"It happens everywhere. I see people all the time getting over to the left hand lane although their current lane doesn't have any traffic in it. If they move to the left and are impeding traffic due to their concentration being on their cell phone, I will slowly pass on the right, beep my horn and give the international ""hang up the phone"" sign so they get they are moving too slowly."
1518,"August 31, 2015  3:27PM",markcincinnati," Well, that's one. I guess I'm talking about a ""national and cultural"" mindset that almost literally develops hives or some other nasty rash when contemplating the notion of passing on the right and ignoring a polite three wink left turn-signal.

1520,"August 31, 2015  4:57PM",markcincinnati," A friend of mine is married to an Ohio State trooper -- he claims that passing on the right is many times more of a contributing factor to crashes than speeding. Bet the speed laws, however, are quite rigorously enforced.  Why is that? Are the fines from speeding higher than from passing on the right infractions? Wait, wait, don't answer that, yet: If the speeding fines are, for example, $100, then passing on the right fines ought to be $250 -- you would think once the word got out that such infractions would sharply shrink.  I'm one of the people that thinks you should either take laws off the books that are routinely ignored or that the infraction fines should be made proportionate to the potential bodily and property damage that such infraction, if ignored, suggests. And, then, of course, enforce them.  So, if my friend's trooper husband is correct, that passing on the right side really is suicide and that speeding, in an of itself is less likely to cause death and destruction, why not ""align the time (i.e., the fine) with the crime"" so to speak? Full disclosure, I have little compunction about driving 85 or 90 in a 70 zone (with assured clear distance), but, as noted, I break out in hives and nausea if I am dragged kicking and screaming into passing on the right due to some moron who certainly must be ignoring my repeated wink, wink, winking left turn signal ""the universal (and polite) signal to please let me pass.""  OK, I have one more ? to pose -- I took driver's ed in high school, I took a course to learn to teach driver's ed in college -- why is it we are taught to maintain about 15' per 10MPH assured clear distance between you and the car in front of you (on the highway, not on the crowded stop and go streets of, say, Manhattan) yet, if you were even to attempt to keep 90' between you and the car in front of you on the state highway or Interstate highway at 60MPH, you are assured someone will risk heaven and earth, life and limb to squeeze in between you and the car in front of you and then essentially brake hard, thereby causing a ripple effect of some dozens and dozens of miles on such thoroughfares as the long flat and straight stretch of highway say between Cincinnati and Columbus OH?  Has no one even heard of the pop-sci occurrence called The Butterfly Effect?"
1521,"August 31, 2015  4:58PM",roadburner,"  I was blessed to be able to spend five weeks in Europe in the summer of 1981; just knocking around with a friend who taught at a French-English school in Deauville.

1522,"August 31, 2015  5:12PM",kyfdx,"I'll give them a chance to move over.. but, I'm not sitting in the fast lane for 5 miles behind someone doing 10 MPH under the traffic flow. At some point, you have to go around. What if they were doing 30 mph?"
1523,"August 31, 2015  6:14PM",qbrozen,"yeah, I don't get the idea of making it illegal to pass on the right. I would hope, however, if a state has both no pass on right AND stay right pass left laws, a cop is going to pull the left-lane camper over instead of the right-lane passer.  I find myself passing on the right many times a day."
1524,"August 31, 2015  6:24PM",markcincinnati," Traffic flow = the ""Natural Speed Limit."" Several studies show that if the speed limit on a given highway is 65 and the flow is 80 - 85, that the flow remains virtually unchanged, when the speed limit is raised to 75 or 80 even. The flow of traffic like the ebb and flow (rise and fall) of the stock market really does have a mind of its own. Efforts to enforce (and seriously fine) lane protocols would do far more to increase the safety of many of our highways than ""speed traps"" will ever do.  There will be folks who drive at 110MPH when the speed limit is 65 or 80 -- that doesn't change. If the natural speed is 85, the ""NORMAL"" range will be 80 - 90MPH. Go figure.  Me, I do pass on the right, but only after sincere and polite attempts to get the Left-Lane-Bandit to move over, I'm crazy, I know, but I do have physical symptoms that arise when I pass on the right -- it seems like breaking a societal covenant restricting and preventing us, mostly, from having ""stupid attacks.""  Thankfully, I can't recall someone driving at 30MPH in a 70 zone in the left lane, I would think I would probably use my voice command cell phone to call 911 to report a very dangerous situation, then I would pass on the right and get the hell outta Dodge!"

I know my dad was more of a GM man than Ford man and he had a disdain for Chrysler yet his first car was a Plymouth and he told me it served him well. Dad wasn't that keen on Chevys, but he was ok with Pontiac, Olds, or Cadillac. For some reason Buick didn't have any appeal to him. Though there has been the odd Toyota, Datsun, Subaru that have been bought as secondary cars and cars for my sisters to drive for college (early 80's), my parents until retiring their 98 Aurora, have stayed the course with GM products. They currently have a CR-V."
1532,"August 26, 2015  3:47AM",qbrozen,"I think its simply a matter of age. You gotta reach far back to find most of the Cadillac fans, like my dad and father-in-law, and they aren't buying cars in that pricerange in their golden years. Those same people would NEVER consider a BMW. The BMW faithful, on the other hand, largely have a car history that dates back to the E30-E36 era, and those cars cemented their fandom. Cadillac is now chasing a younger crowd who never previously gave them a 2nd look, while BMW is slowly alienating its fans with softer cars. How will that all pan out? We'll see."

Now, the few sticks offered are strippies (often) and for the most part, the cars are -- as noted -- getting squishy, less taught, with less of the performance edge. Although, oddly, HP and torque do continue to climb.  You gives and you gets (sort of).  The Infiniti sales rep remarked ""I don't know why anyone would want paddle shifters."" What's up with that?"

During that time I was starting a career and family and money was tight. All I could afford was Chevys and I was satisfied, until my '79 Chevette. It broke down 12 miles from the dealer's showroom the day I picked it up and had to be towed back. That was just the beginning of the problems. I traded it for a Mazda GLC several months later and have owned nothing but Japanese cars since, with 2 reliable Fords in the mix. I now have a Volvo S60, as I mentioned in a prior post and an Outback, my 3rd Subaru.  I wish GM well and would love to be in an ATS or CTS, but I just feel I can get a better car for less money elsewhere. And the crappy dealer experience others have talked about also gives me pause."
1537,"August 26, 2015  2:44PM",flightnurse,"So, we arrived in Munich today, was picked up at the Airport in a BMW 750Ld, nice car, great engine, Tri Turbo inline 6 diesel. it makes something like 450lbs of torque. was interesting to watch the drive navigate the highway. We topped 150mph, I've read about about this car, was great to be driven in it. Friday we take delivery of Ricks BMW.  This whole discussion been interesting, GM needed to make room for the ATS, that meant the CTS needed to be price higher then before, GM needed to take a couple of play from the likes of Lexus and Hyundai more content at a lower price, then slowly raise prices I don't think the CTS was moving up the price trail as it was being improved. Now, I have two neighbors who have CTS, both are V6, both have been stone reliable, one is a 2012, then other is a 2013. I remember when the ATS cane out and a couple of people where praising the car, Myself and a couple of others pointed out the biggest issue with the CTS and ATS was simple, their size, they are too small in the segment they are in. Granted some people like that, but the buying public does not and want the size. When GM gets around to increase the size of both cars, the next generation of the 3 and 5 series will be out and be bigger and better. Once again, GM is playing catch up."
1538,"August 26, 2015  4:05PM",roadburner,"This morning a friend called and asked me to take his latest toy for a drive; said toy is a 2007 Mercedes-AMG E63 fitted with the Weistec M156 Power Package 1, meaning it makes 441 hp and 394lb-ft of torque measured at the wheels. He's a bit intimidated by the car and wanted me to wring it out. Now THIS is a car I can truly call fast with a straight face. Stock it would do 0-60 in 4.2 seconds and run the quarter in 12.6 seconds @115 mph. My friend also likes drag racing and he wants me to run it at the local 1/8-mile strip. He's had the car down in the low eight second range but I think the high sevens are entirely possible. Of course, I had to take it down my personal road course test track and the car was pretty much unflappable(the car sports Michelin PSS rubber).

Dropping the car off the night before, picking up a courtesy car for the day and coming back 24 hours later . . . routine.  ""I'm sorry, I don't have any SQ5 loaners . . . but I've got this freshly PDR'd car that has 35 miles on it you can have, if you don't mind. It's an A8L. I also have a new A7, but I thought you might like to be the very first customer to drive the A8.""  Actually, I had hoped for an A6 -- considering some of our recent ""chats"" here on edmunds. But, it is so very unlikely we'd ever willingly, knowingly and with our own money go for another A8 (not that we didn't like our previous one), well, why not.  I am a lover and geek on all things Audi, but frankly I just don't spend any time keeping up with the A8 or R8 cars, I needed an edumacation . . . .  This was the L version -- the back seat space is larger than some closets or storage sheds, if the thing wasn't so quiet at speed, you'd need an intercom to speak to the pilot were you seated back there,  Otherwise, we set the drive select to dynamic (the rep looked at my wife who set this parameter after starting the car, and said ""go figure"" -- my wife is used to an SQ5, after all) and turned on the heads-up display, found some nice tuneage on the sat radio and drove off in eerie silence arriving a triple digits speeds in the blink of an eye. Yikes this thing must be electric it is so quiet and smoooth (and this one had the air suspension, which I suspect is standard and the 20"" wheels with summer only rubber.)  Full LED front and rear lighting -- and everything that could be motorized was -- and oh that fantastic, should be mandated by the Feds, Top View monitor (how I miss that one aspect of our 2011 Infiniti).  I finally got the sticker out of the glove box and noted this puppy was a V6 (333HP) -- my S4's V6. Impressive in this size car as it never seemed to want for any bit of power -- there was always plenty on reserve.  Air conditioned seats -- ahhhhh cooling those hot crossed buns -- I had forgotten how nice cool leather can feel, even on a hot summer day.  Here's the real deal, however -- while the car is, even were it free -- too large, it feels not much larger than my S4. Also, I cannot tell a lie, it is not as nimble as an S4, and certainly not as powerful as you would expect with the extra girth the motor had to manage, but it seemed quite capable of convincing perhaps the vast majority of folks that it was a sporting-like sedan, not just a luxo-barge. The top view camera made navigating a tight parking garage this morning easy-peazy.  If you have $92,000 (but this one had a nearly $6,000 Executive package credit, wiping out the Executive package price) laying around burning a hole wanting to be spent on a new luxury but still very much a driver's car vehicle, say no more, look no further. I can't imagine my neighbor's 7 series (also an L) which, by comparison, seems so stark and strident inside -- and which cost over $110K could be more attractive, price weighted.  I don't know how the 2016 A8L 3.0T is thought of by the pros, but this amateur thinks for $86,000 nothing even comes close -- in this class (large luxo-barge).  Of course, had I that much coin to drop on ONE car, I would still ""settle"" on a full-on great balls of fire S6 Prestige with the custom red leather seats.  Now that would be something to write home about.  Me, I'm looking forward to a slightly larger 2018 S4 with all the cool tech this 2016 A8 has on it.  I wonder if they ever provide RS7's as loaners -- I'd bet not."
1540,"August 28, 2015 12:19AM",qbrozen,"$86k? Eh, I'd be looking at a Panamera or Tesla, methinks"
1541,"August 28, 2015  1:40AM",markcincinnati," I did look at a Panamera -- and with anything even close to the content of the A8, the price would shoot over $100K.  The Audi that I would think much more competitive (in every aspect) with the Panamera is the RS7. This A8L was an ocean-going vessel -- the fact that it felt smaller than its barge like dimensions doesn't make it anything that would be attractive to someone who would look at either an RS7 or Panamera, if you axe me.  While I liked the temporary experience, I wouldn't even consider one, personally. I wonder if the S8 might be more of a Panamera cross-shopper. Don't know . . . and not all that interested in making a comparison, at this point, life's too short. A half step between an A4 and A6 is about the size I find interesting today.  About $58K for my S4 and about $65K for my wife's SQ5 -- what's that come to?"" $123K -- for TWO cars. Something just seems ""off"" about spending that much on ONE car -- but I could be wrong. There comes a point where I read about the $85K Cadillac V or M3 and their accelerations to 62MPH are in the neighborhood of 4 seconds. I then go back in time and find the same magazine's numbers for my ""lowly"" S4 to be 4.8 seconds (some magazines claim even quicker). I'll keep the $27K for other things and make certain never to challenge an M3 to a drag race at the local traffic light. I'm all for big bad acceleration, etc, but all that money for such a relatively small increase in acceleration is something that I find very difficult to justify, especially since it is so rare I can ever floor my non-tumescent S4 for fear of overtaking and rear ending just about everything else on the road."

I think his wants/desires were based on the marketing of his era (40s-50s) when U.S. based car companies ruled the market. Just like GM wanted, you started with a Chevy, went to maybe Oldsmobile, then Buick and finally, Cadillac. Ford started you with their namesake, moved you to Mercury, and finally Lincoln. Chrysler started you at Plymouth, then to Dodge, then to Chrysler, and finally to Imperial (yes, my Father had one...no branded Chrysler but Imperial).  Cadillac, Lincoln, Imperial were the pinnacles of automotive excellence during those decades. European, and particularly Japanese brands were viewed with disdain in our household, at the time."

1558,"August 29, 2015  4:29PM",markcincinnati,"My wife and I have been to Europe/Germany perhaps twenty to twenty-five times (some trips, not many, didn't include Germany, that is) -- we always fly into Munich, even if our destination is Venice or Zurich or even Vienna. Of all of the European cities we've been to, Munich is the one where I think I could live AND work. Much as we like Verona and Prague, and even Kraków (and what's not to like about London, Paris and even Brussles), Munich is THE city where I think I could work. The train from Munich to Venice, via Innsbruck is the most beautiful ride we've ever taken -- and OMG in winter, as my friend says, ""If there is winter in heaven, this is what it MUST look like.""  But, as usual, I digress. I really do have a, hopefully legitimate, question for you flightnurse: What would have been the American MSRP of your new BMW and what was the difference due to buying the car via ED? The last time I looked into this, it seemed that the price delta paid for the trip -- and then, if you factor in the cost of renting a car, you actually end up paying only for your hotels and food, making the trip to some of the most beautiful sights on the planet about equal to or less than a trip to the US west coast (from Cincinnati).  Of course, I would agree, if you're in Germany and/or other European countries, you may splurge on restaurants and (if in Italy) clothes and other items unavailable in the US.  To wit: if you two read this and are going to circle back to Munich, our 2nd favorite restaurant on earth is in Munich, it is called Tantris.  Tantris, Munich: - http://www.tantris.de/home.php  Note the tie in with Audi on the page that is displayed at the link.  Bon Appétite! (I had to misspell this to prevent the nanny from suppressing it. . .'cmon now!)"
1559,"August 29, 2015  5:42PM",dino001,"Yeah, the ED MSRP is 7 percent off base model US MSRP plus destination and options are priced at US MSRP. It makes base models especially great deals, then as you add options, the discount gets smaller. So for example 50k base plus 5k options plus 900 destination it is 52.4k, or 3.5 grand nominal savings. However, you don't get any additional rebates, like those cash credits or rebates that BMW sometimes throws for the US delivery (disclaimers often specifically exclude ED). You can negotiate the price down from the ED MSRP toward their invoice just the same as US delivery (unlike Benz or Volvo, which have the ED prices price fixed), but many dealers would have none of it. Don't know why, perhaps it's just posturing, but I heard of that several times. I think it may be their way of discouraging of doing it, as they always prefer intant gratification of delivery, so the attitude may be, fine, but I'm not doing a damn thing to incentivise the deal vs. my stock. There are also complications with the trade, if you want to make one, as there is about three month from signing the deal and getting the car. Essentially, you lose any leverage on the trade price, unless you are willing to give the car at time of the signing the deal.  Bottom line, the actual savings depend on the context of its actual going transaction prices for stock Deliveries. For models selling close to MSRP, like say M-models, the savings are great. For those selling closer to invoice, or having extra cash rebates, it is less. However, factoring the extra vacation experience, even if the savings aren't as big as the face value, it's totally worth it. BTW, you can combine ED with so-called Performance Delivery in South Carolina, which makes the experience even more awesome. Paid night at Sheraton, dinner, breakfast, morning at a track, doing quick loops, braking, skip pad (not your car, just one that's a same or similar similar model; they put me in 335), then a factory visit, plus X5 off-road course after lunch. All at no extra charge. If only have a chance, I will do it again."
1560,"August 23, 2015  2:25PM",dino001,"They probably should change the name, too. While there is some brand equity left for older folks, I suspect people under 40 could not care less. They need to rebuild, but their problem they don't seem to get it."
1561,"August 23, 2015  3:05PM",Mr_Shiftright,"I thought the same thing---Cadillac should have had a new name 10 years ago, e.g. Toyota/Lexus. The Lexus name became gold-plated in about ten years time."

Lexus did it right- time to start over again caddy. Would also add to the union stuff above - cannot believe the leader ship will let a potential collapse happen again in less then 10 years.

So y'all are probably right that they should cut their prices to re-establish themselves. I just worry that they would take that as a reason to skimp on the car.

They can spend the money languishing in inventory or price 'em right to get 'em on the roads."
1566,"August 24, 2015 11:26AM",dino001,"But then there is their cost structure. How low is low and can GM make money? I would bet Toyota didn't make much, if anything in first ten years of Lexus. That's why I'm not not optimistic about them, at all."
1567,"August 24, 2015 12:53PM",graphicguy,"Q...your car is indeed quite nice, regardless of the parameter you're using as a measuring stick....performance, materials, etc.  What drew me to the CTS were the steep discounts, too.....along with the fact that I thought the CTS drove better than a 5 Series, and certainly looked better. Have they priced themselves out of the market? I don't know.  But, at this price range (or any price range, for that matter), people expect a level of service that reflects the price and status of the car. That's where Cadillac really falls down. They may have put a nice product out there, but they can not pretend like customer service is an after thought (as they have with mine, which has spent it's 30th day in the dealer's shop as of today). Further, either they can't, or won't fix it. I think it's a combination of the two. They are trained to read a computer read out of a fix, and that's it. If it doesn't show a code, they view it as ""operating as normal"".  BMW, Jag, Lexus, Mercedes, Acura, Infiniti, etc operate on a level several levels above that type of service.  I love your car, I really do. My Cadillac ownership experiences have been a nightmare, though.  Those experiences, along with pricing, are what's caused volumes to drop dramatically. They have to fix both simultaneously, and quickly, if they want to survive."
1568,"August 24, 2015  1:30PM",jeffm5,"Jeez, I've wanted a Caddy since I was 16. I got my Medicare card this year, so I doubt it's going to happen. I almost bought a CTS way back in 2005 when they were offering employee discount prices. But the CTS was RWD only back in those days and we live in the snow belt. I looked at an ATS in 2013, but priced with the options I wanted it was out of reach. I ""settled"" on a Volvo S60. Great car and very good dealer experience."
1569,"August 24, 2015  1:32PM",dino001," That's essentially a full overhaul. Add a name change for a good measure. I truly believe they should try do ""a Lexus"", but I doubt they will.  I think they are simply unable to change, first because they think they don't need to (if they did, they'd never put those crazy CTS prices and also priced ATS more in line with Acura/Volvo products, not Benz/BMW). Second, even if they saw a need for change, they are locked into the dealership network that is three times as large as it should be, considering current sales volumes. I'm sure those franchise contracts don't let them walk away at will, there are steep penalties, plus political fallout (imagine those tearful articles of lost jobs in a small town Cadillac dealer).  In essence, what they need to do, they can't and they won't. It's just going to be slow dying, probably very slow (they still sell good deal of Escalades), interrupted by some pretend moves and couple of short resurgences (once in a while they'll have a good month, or quarter), which will only postpone it. As before, a belief in a new ad campaign fixing all their ills will be magical."
1570,"August 24, 2015  2:22PM",qbrozen," Think about that for a second, though ... there is a reason why Acura/Volvo is cheaper than Benz/BMW [and I'll add Lexus], and its not just because they choose to be. I'll give you a hint: it is also why the Lexus ES V6 is cheaper than the IS V6.  I'm not saying you are wrong, necessarily. Just that there are, effectively, 2 classes of luxo cars (IMHO), and Caddy fits in the typically more expensive of those. However, they might find themselves better off cutting prices across the board, let's say $5k, rather than discounting the damned things $10k after they've been sitting around all year. They are already slightly cheaper than the Germans, just not enough, apparently."
1571,"August 24, 2015  2:54PM",markcincinnati,"How about NOT lowering the actual sticker price but figuring out a way to get a bunch of the cars out there via the traditional sub-venting of leases. I would think if you get enough cars out there AND they are indeed a good and reliable (they can work on durable later) product, well economics 101 -- demand will go up as price drops (IF the reliability is there).  Include all maintenance, of course and improve the dealership experience to Premium Car (European and Japanese) expectations.  Then, assuming all of the above (especially the goodness of the product) comes to pass, THEN allow the sub-venting to erode. As the post above says -- this will be about a 10 year exercise.  I must say, after watching Audi and UNINTENDED acceleration etc, 10 years would be a bargain, if Cadillac could pull it off in that period of time.  At some point in time, however, the product/brand differentiation has to shift from low price to a specific brand identity based on ""something you're known for"" or perhaps several somethings that you're known for.  I know of no one that is a animated and passionate about any Cadillac in the same way many Audi and BMW ""fans"" have passion. When I grew up in the 60's, you had your Chevy folks and your Ford folks -- and you had some (but a lower number than in the Chevy and Ford camps) who were, hmm, ""MoPar"" folks (beep beep).  I've been to Audi and BMW factory sponsored driving schools -- and the faithful who attend are meat eaters, red -- as in barely cooked -- meat eaters.  Checking out AudiWorld.com for instance you'll find a lot of passion I would assume other brands know just can't be bought. From my perspective, only BMW and Audi have both the breadth and depth of passionate fans -- Cadillac? Well, not so much.  We need Cadillac to not just survive, we need them to grow and prosper."

1573,"August 24, 2015  4:12PM",dino001," You're looking at the content. I'm looking at the brand equity. Cadillac simply doesn't have it. There are only two ways to build it:  a. Killer product, killer service/experience, high price, low volume, niche product, build it up from there; translation - crash in sales, close 75 percent of dealerships, consolidate production, long and painful process, but can be successful, if executed properly. You make lots of money on every unit sold, but don't expect to be on the best seller list. but Call it ""Jaguar option"" b. Killer product, killer service/experience, undercut price - low profits, build brand equity, then start slowly raising it. GM has neither. Requires deep pockets, lots of patience. Call it ""Lexus option"". Patience has never been a virtue of American corporations (especially those publicly traded on Wall Street). Add of course additional issues with memories of bailout, it probably doesn't have the money, either.  So Cadillac chose option c: pretend you can get higher prices on somewhat (arguably a lot) improved product without changing any other aspect of your business."

Investors want their investment to grow. That's it. That's all they want.  What bothers me, GM had a clean slate. Debt wiped out. Had an excuse to wipe out whole brands and dealers with little in the way of repurcussions (Oldsmobile, Hummer, Pontiac, etc). They could have become a great company, ONCE AGAIN! They had the opportunity to become good at whatever they chose.  At least in Cadillac's case, they went right back to the same old GM with indifferent quality, buggy technology, subpar customer support, etc.  I rent a lot of cars. I've rented a lot of Chevy Cruz's. On the surface, it's a pretty competitive car. You drive it for a few days and understand one thing.....""were the designers and engineers hamstrung by the accontants, again?"".  I know a lot of times, even with my CTS, I ask myself...""did the builders, designers, engineers really think this through?"" The answer is usually ""NO""! It's like they got part of the way there, and just ran out of time, or ran out of money, or just stopped before what they were doing was fully baked.  circle...you're right.

1577,"August 25, 2015  1:14PM",dino001,"I think the ""old GM"" is in the comeback exactly because that bankruptcy was tainted by politics. Law blatantly disregarded - for those who don't know, stakeholder's payoff order was changed in favor White House political backers (i.e. unions) rather than those who (by law) deserve it most (senior bondholders with secured notes). This basically taught them wrong lesson.  In essence, the process was not painful enough. Bankruptcy is supposed to be painful, as it wipes out those with weak interest (like shareholders, employees) and damages those with stronger interest (debt holders, government). It's an exchange - bondholders stop the imminent execution of the debt and in exchange they receive equity in reorganized company. All of that is overseen by a judge in a process that usually starts as adversarial and ends as cooperative. The plan for the reorganized company needs to be approved by a judge, but the bondholders have ample opportunity to give their input and voice their concerns. NONE OF THAT HAPPENED!!! Government came, wiped out those they deemed ""unworthy"" (and used media to vilify them in the process), gave rewards to those who were ""worthy"" (read supported their political cause) and then bullied judicial system to approve the tainted deal. A true disappointment was that the judges did not find enough courage to stop it. I can only guess why.  In this climate, how anybody can make real decisions? Those that can be even more difficult and more painful? There is no way.

1579,"August 25, 2015  3:27PM",markcincinnati,"dino001:  Let's stipulate that your observations are accurate. We then need to say that we can't un-ring the bell.  As a practical matter, while your comments would still be accurate they would probably not be made or even too much cared about if what emerged was a ""great"" car from a great car company (isolating Cadillac here).  I went to a friend's birthday party over the weekend -- of course after the dinner, some of the typical male/female behavior emerged with the two genders gathered in two groups catching up and being social. One of the well-wishers apparently was well off enough to have had several Ferrari's and he was remarking how he had never had any car have a $10,000 bill for what he would classify as routine mntce (a new clutch for a manual transmission Ferrari). His beloved Italian had just cost him this much -- ouch!  The conversation about cars was ""on."" In the parking-lot population of a couple of dozen premium cars (from Europe and Asia) there was a lone Cadillac CTS coupe. We all agreed the car was handsome -- the owner added his own comments suggesting that he agreed the car was beautiful to behold but that it had been a lot of trouble and that his [few] Cadillac owning friends had not one satisfied member amongst them.  I'm not sure what all of the ""big"" problems were, but problems seemed to plague just about every system a car has, according to him. The birthday boy (age 60) has a Mercedes V8 coupe (the $125,000 version whatever/whenever that is) and a Sonota with 120K miles on it. He wants a Porsche -- don't know what one -- but he says he can't beat the Sonota for its 100% reliability (and, at 120K miles, I would expect he would add durability, too), so he drives it to the office and saves the Merc for weekends. He also has one of those giant Yukon XL SUV's and a couple of Harley's.  Were I a Cadillac employee or affiliated in any way with Cadillac, this would have been a cringe-worthy event, with folks saying mostly positive things about everything but Cadillac's cars; and the things being said about Cadillac were enough to make someone in the market, draw a line through the brand altogether -- with the possible exception of the Escalade.  One couple drove their new Mercedes GLA crossover -- which I was able to see up close and personal, interior included. Very nice looking car -- especially from the outside. Interior fit and finish seemed nice, but man the thing was really small inside -- smaller, I think, than an Audi Q3. I don't know how much actual utility it had, how many groceries it could carry, but I do think it is one of Mercedes best looking products in years.  My take away from the whole evening -- pertaining to cars -- was that Cadillac is not in a particularly good place right now with respect to what ""the people"" (the market) are saying. Here [Edmund's] we've got folks saying ""are you kidding"" with respect to the price vs the competition and you have the bourgeoisie saying the cars are, well, pretty much crap with respect to reliability.  Best of both worlds?! Yikes."

Life has been difficult for Cadillac lately as it struggles to make the leap from premium – expensive cars – to the luxury category – cars whose valuable brand command an extra margin. Cadillac raised prices last year in an effort to look more exclusive, then was forced to bet a hasty retreat when customers stayed away. At the end of January, a Reuters analysis revealed that Cadillac was sitting on a four-month supply of unsold CTS sedans and six months worth of ATS sedans. Strangely, while its newer passenger cars languish, Cadillac can’t keep up with demand for the old-style Escalade SUV, some highly optioned versions of which, Reuters discovered, can carry prices in excess of $100,000."

I mentioned as part of one of my rants/posts that when I grew up in rural Ohio in the 60's, there were Chevy ""guys"" and Ford ""guys"" and even some Chryco (aka mopar) ""guys.""  The passion of the Chevy folks was the relentless kidding of the Fix Or Repair Daily crowd and of course the other way around (General Mess of Crap, as I recall). The Buick car company had seriously powerful cars -- my buddy drove a Buick Special to high school every day (and this was a full-sized V8 packin' hot rod -- don't let's it mass confuse you, you face off with the Special, you see tail lights.) Of course there were Goats and Stangs and my favorite (Beep Beep) Plymouth road runners that, in a straight line, were scary good and ready to smoke the rear tires, or actually SHRED the rear tires.  My cousin had an Impala SS (a two-door affair with a HUGE butt but also gobs of tire smokin' power) with a rear deck speaker WITH REVERB! Whew, I'm all verklempt.  The faithful high schoolers became faithful, loyal customers of their chosen brands -- my parents first had Hudson Hornets, then, with the demise of Twin H power (dual carbs), dad moved to Plymouth, then Chrysler -- I recall when I was in college he got a Cordoba, with fine Corinthian leather and the fake leather half roof.  The point is, my uncles were loyal to their brands -- my Augusta, GA uncle always had Pontiacs, his two brothers, one of them my dad had Chryco cars -- my uncle had a Plymouth Sport Fury, Plymouth's answer to the Chevy Impala Super Sport.  I mean these folks, then, wouldn't be budged from the brand.  What the heck happened?  Now, before I go into the weeds too deeply, I must say my friends are mostly loyal to a brand. My BMW driving friends will probably never stray. My buddy who drives Acuras, just won't even bother shopping elsewhere.  So what happened -- one would think there would have been at least some vestige of brand loyalty and that ought to translate to Cadillac as well. Apparently not.  What I have found is ""American"" car dealers didn't get the memo that must've come out at the end of the 70's or the early 80's. I simply, personally, can't imagine putting up with the crap these hold over dealers ""Fast Eddy's"" or ""Juicy Lucy's"" and their ilk deal.  Is it a matter of the dealerships? Is it a matter of . . . what? You'd think if you were a dealer facing a declining market, that you would ""go undercover"" and see how the most successful dealerships treat their ""clients"" and flat out imitate that behavior.  Sure, you may have to kiss a lot of frogs, but eventually you're going to learn what the attraction is -- at least at the Premium and Lux brands -- a Cadillac dealer with even one Fast Eddy or Juicy Lucy on the payroll isn't going to cut it.  Of course, this doesn't wipe out all of the sins of an iffy product, but maybe it would help.  Man, if I were Audi's former, now Cadillac's top US Exec, I would be calling in every favor I could to, as Young Frankenstein once said ""Get me the hell outta here -- don't you recognize a joke?"""

It cost 20 grand less in total ownership, even though 2010 S4 has already depreciated a good deal (essentially S4 still is more and anticicapted repairs kill it in this category). Yes, it is also nicer, but I don't see unquestionned superiority. And this is still the pedestrian WRX, not STI, which you can get for that price purchase difference of 5 grand or so. Extra stuff, better AWD. I know, Audi has RS4, but adjusted for the money, Subaru does it better. Engineering has always been a game of optimizing the variables to bring the value. Take WRX against A4/A5 2.0, see who wins. And WRX still costs less. Even STI may cost less than A4/A5.  It's easy to deliver a monster nobody can afford.

Difficult to say if it'll pan out, but I think it will provide some pizzazz and buzz for Acura dealers. Prototypes are now being made, but the NSX won't be for sale for about 6 months as a 2017 model. Auto Blog as some tidbits they've gotten from the engineers and builders of the NSX, which is being built in Ohio:  http://www.autoblog.com/2015/08/15/acura-nsx-cosworth-engine-block-details/  ""Acura NSX will use Cosworth block, plus other neat tidbits   The blue NSX you see here was built just two weeks ago. Prototype number six, it rolled off Acura's newest assembly line in Ohio and was rushed out to the Monterey peninsula for various car week activities. We had a chance to sit down with several members of the NSX team to discuss the car, the long road from concept to production, and some interesting details. Below are some choice bits from our conversations.  Acura is pretty proud of the fact that NSX version 2.0 was designed and is being built in the US. The new assembly line, called the Performance Manufacturing Center, is in Honda's hometown of Marysville, Ohio. While the line is brand new, the building has seen many uses over its lifetime, most recently as a warehouse facility. PMC staff numbers about 100, with 60 technical and 40 non-technical associates.  The car uses parts sourced globally, and one of those sources is Cosworth. The engine blocks and heads come from the English firm and get assembled into twin-turbo powerhouses at Honda's nearby Anna, Ohio, engine plant. The Cosworth name is rarely associated with a bad engine, so we were geeked to hear the NSX's 550-plus-horsepower hybrid powertrain has good genes....  ....the NSX buyer will get to make lots of decisions to craft a custom order. Choices will include paint, interior hues, several wheel styles and finishes, and additional carbon-fiber parts and trim; the standard car will have an aluminum roof, while a carbon piece can be spec'd, and available carbon dress-up pieces will include side sills, a rear diffuser, and an engine dress-up kit. The newly announced blue paint, called Nouvelle Blue Pearl, like the red used on the 2015 show car, uses a fancy multi-layer paint process from PPG that does a nice job of highlighting the surfacing and creases in the car's body. It gave the production engineers a headache, however, since it takes about 16 hours to cure versus regular paint's two-hour wait time. Not surprisingly, it will be an extra-cost option.""

I do not count myself among those who are able to discern the difference; between many AWD systems -- unless they are of the FWD power biased flavor (my TL SH-AWD was FWD biased and it did seem to have gobs of torque steer, which my Audis do not exhibit).  Today, Subarus no matter what their content or technology are not in the Premium Class. For all I know they do have Audi AWD chops and are $20K or $40K less. Even the C&D comparo ended with the conclusion that the author(s) would take a 2010 S4 over a new WRX. I read their words, I do not have any experience that would allow me to make an informed (and possibly biased or unbiased) comment on the matter.  I would, initially, expect a $60K car to be in some ways superior to a $30 or $40K car, content, styling, performance, the whole package-wise. This would not be an indictment against the lesser cost vehicle.  For the moeny, were I to be given a Subaru budget, I would NOT opt for the 5-year old Audi -- I would indeed go with something NEW (very possibly the Subaru).  My experiene would lead me to advise someone who wanted S4-like performance for less money, to look seriously at an Acura TLX SH-AWD (Advance). If the Premium Car experience was unimportant to this someone, I would certainly suggest they shop Subaru, especially if one of their criteria was having AWD.  I have, very recently, read some reviews of the Nissan Maxima Platinum version -- while not a member of the Premium Class (as defined by someone, somewhere), this new Maxima certainly seems to ring many of the bells that one would normally associate with ELLPS -- although Infiniti folks would certainly beg to differ.  Most of what I seem to come across in my google searches are essays and sites that praise Audi's TorSen based quattro system as ""one of the best"" or sometimes even the best AWD systems currently on the market.  That Subaru's system may be right up there is something I shall surely remember when I come across such commentary or test reports. Mean time, since we're not speaking/discussing, HERE of either Lambo's or Subbie's systems, I suggest we discuss an even larger issue for some folks: AWD vs 2WD -- my position is that AWD is what the market is looking for and willing to spend money on.

No, no, an A5 or 4 series won't do. The reason I want something that is really in-between is I just want something a little bit bigger (and this is a contradiction -- I know -- I've flip flopped on this more than twice).  I was loaned an A6 3.0T with a sport package. I liked it -- but, even with the sport package it didn't seem to be quite as nimble as I had mis-remembered it would be. Then today, 4 of us from my office went to lunch together -- well the two folks in the back seat of the S4 were ""this close"" to having enough knee room -- another inch back seat space would have been fine -- two inches ample.  I keep holding out hope that the new A4/S4 coming out next year will grow slightly in all directions -- but meantime, the gap between the A4 and A6 is large enough, I think, for there to be something that would fit in between; maybe an A5, gulp, sedan? Or a junior A7.  BTW, drove an S6 again -- love the power, love everything about it, except it is too big (well it would be most of the time) and it gives off so very few ""S"" cues from behind the wheel, it is somewhat disappointing. It performs great -- has gobs of go and stopping power, and it does have an ""S"" suspension from a capability perspective -- but the car is a cocoon. Usually a good thing, but when you pay that much, it would be nice if it had a bit of GRRR to be found.  I'm still lookin' for the tweener . . . plain and simple."

1614,"August 20, 2015  4:01PM",breld,"@markcincinnati - I don't disagree that a little more rear legroom would be nice than what's currently offered in the 3/4 series and the A4/5, but not so sure how much room there is to slot another model between those and the 5-series and A6.  The 3-series GT sort of offers what you speak of, with loads of rear seat legroom on that longer 3-series platform. Whether you like the looks of the vehicle is a different matter.  I'm sure the new A4 next year will offer some sort of increase in size - maybe that will be a sweetspot for you. I am finding myself quite fond of the size of the current S4 - from a driving perspective, I liken it to the 335 (E90) I had a little while ago, and compared to that, the Audi adds just enough extra room to make it feel a little less ""compact."""

While very good from mile one and better after mile 150, now at a couple grand miles on the road, I can offer this:  These tires are really UHP tires, they do not, from my perspective here in SW Ohio, need to apologize or explain why they are a compromise shoe. I can think of no attribute of this tire that makes me long for a MAX Perf (summer only) tire instead. I do not track my car. I do not take my car off normal highways, roads and streets. I generally enjoy taking corners and curves as aggressively as possible (given traffic and other safety considerations, of course). When conditions and traffic (and the long arm of the law) permits, I have been known to exceed 100MPH (usually on Interstates where traffic is thin and widely spaced).  I like a tire to be quiet. I do not want ANY tread noise. Not gonna tolerate it.  The handling, braking, ""quietness"", comfort and anything you can think of that describes performance of these tires is (are) exemplary. While not cheap, the tires will not require you to take out a second mortgage, and they should last some 40,000+ miles and still remind you they are (mostly) still UHP tires.  Unless you have no need for cold weather or ""light-snow"" traction, these tires should be given a good look-see and test drive (if possible). I don't want to make this too dramatic, but I cannot think of any tire that I have ever had that exceeds the performance of the DWS 06 Continental Extremes.  I sourced these from Tire Rack; and after they were mounted and road force balanced my S4 was given a 4-wheel alignment.  A+"

1625,"August 14, 2015  3:58PM",markcincinnati,"You Never Close Your Eyes . . .  To many – perhaps most – of us born in the ‘50’s, it is difficult to comprehend or even imagine the apparent blasé attitude of many Americans, most of them born after the ‘70’s or ‘80’s (apparently), toward cars. I work with 30, 40 & 50-somethings. Only those seeing, or soon seeing their 5th decade seem to have much, if any, interest in cars. One gentleman loves his Mini; and is a pretty ardent participant in local and even some national Mini events.  Getting him started on what he did last weekend surely invites him to share the pictures from the most recent cross-country Mini event or gathering. He has a map over his desk outlining a coast-to-coast Mini drive, and it is easy to find him gazing – longingly – at that map from time-to-time. Other than that, these “youngsters” seem to care less about what “my peeps” hold dear: Fine cars, fine dining, fine wine and home theaters that require a minimum of a 70” screen.  These “yutes” seem mildly, or politely, interested in “my generation’s” escapades, but there is virtually no-one left on the planet who seems to know or care much about cars – far as I know, I’m the only subscriber to any auto-enthusiast magazines; no really, I’m the last one, anywhere.  One of the mid-fifty-ish folks I know recently traded in his stick-shift Acura TL for a used RDX (really incredibly low mileage). He had, at least, taken the time to research his purchase, remarking about the SH-AWD and the turbo charged engine (and he loves the DVD-Audio sound system). But, beyond his own vehicle, beyond the Acura brand, he neither knows nor cares.  My nephew, a twenty-something wrapping up his undergraduate degree (part time) while working (full time), certainly has the means to drive something that could get his adrenaline pumping, but he has a Saturn – and I don’t think it has been washed anytime in the 21st century, leading me to conclude he cares not at all for cars (his at least).  OK, so I can find almost no-one interested in discussing the “Performance Sedan” (ELLPS and/or LPS) class. Must be that when I was growing up the automobile was the symbol of freedom, fun and somewhat even a symbol of a certain status (thinking of V8 vs 6, “SS” vs Biscayne, etc.). Thin red-striped sidewall tires, “Wide-Oval” rubber and Hurst Shifters in your newly acquired Goat ruled my formative years. I couldn’t wait to get my temps, my license and ultimately my own car, a 1963 lime-green Chrysler Newport. I ran the thing without an air-cleaner and pulled the hub-caps (remember those?) and shined the matte black paint on the wheels with STP and Pledge (as I recall, I did this ritual daily – at least during the good months of the year).  Today, our office manager a late-30’s woman, cares about cars perhaps on-par with dishwashing machines and dual-fuel ranges; no wait, dual-fuel ranges rule, especially if they come from Kitchen Aid or Jenn-Air.  Today’s youth, consisting, in part, of tomorrow’s Premium Class buyers look at cars almost as a necessary evil or, at best, a four-wheel appliance – seemingly the more sterile and passionless the better.  It seems to me that cars must no longer symbolize freedom, rather they suggest you're “joining a group” [under duress] – these post-baby boomers somehow “lost that lovin’ feelin’” so many of us embraced then and, without being too sentimental, come close to cherishing today.  I recall my sophomore year at college – I had met the girl. She lived in Florida, I in Ohio, and I just couldn’t imagine how we could spend Thanksgiving break apart, so I filled up the ol’ ’63 Newport and made the drive – virtually non-stop – from Oxford, Ohio to Naples, Florida. It is a wonder I didn’t kill myself, I got so sleepy.  The point is, the car granted me both the ability and freedom to choose to make the moronic decision to drive, almost literally, down and back over a three-day period (and, since I needed gas money, I had to sleep in the damn car, unable to afford a place to stay). I loved it.  “Kids” today don’t take “road trips,” don’t yell “shot-gun” and don’t know that a ’63 Newport had the 361 CI V8, while the 300 and the New Yorker had a 383 and a 413 respectively. Clarification, I would not expect a 20-year old today to know much, if anything about a 1963 vintage automobile; my point is these youngin’s don’t know what 335i, 328i, quattro, SH-AWD, 4-Motion, Tip-tronic or even ABS means. I assume they know the name BMW, Cadillac and Ferrari, however – I hope they do, anyway.  Automobile manufacturers have a lot of research, development and marketing to do if they want to return to their former selves, in terms of being Objets de Desír.  Those of us who bother to participate here, it appears, are [perhaps] a dying generation."
1626,"August 14, 2015  4:30PM",Mr_Shiftright,"Young people just express this differently. Many find ""utility"" far more attractive than ""performance"". Perhaps that's what you're noticing.  Just as one example. There is a seriously significant ""cult"" of young people who spend big bucks on VW Camper Vans and who travel in packs around the country.

1627,"August 14, 2015  4:48PM",robr2,"mark - I have to agree. I would have to say that most under 30 have no interest in automobiles. As hard as I tried, my 18 YO could care less about cars.  You mentioned the freedom that your 93 Newport gave you. I too felt that my 72 Cutlass gave me freedom. But we grew up in a much smaller world. Cases in point:  Before I had a grown up job, I had been on one plane trip. I can't count the number of times my kids have been on plane trips. My 15 YO daughter is going on 3 of them in the next 12 months and none of them is with family.  We had 3 channels on TV - if your family was rich and had UHF TV, you might have 5.  We had one avocado green rotary phone in the kitchen and we didn't make long distance calls. I remember my parents calling the operator to schedule a time for an overseas line to call family for a few expensive minutes of conversation.  On Sundays we went to church then went to our cousin's house for a late lunch and a day of fun or the beach for an all day outing involving lots of water, sand, and sunburns.  We would go on vacation to the beach two hours away and know nothing of what was going on at home.  Kids today - I can't believe I just said that - have the world at the fingertips and that is their freedom. The don't need a car to take them away.  It's not necessarily a bad thing. We can lament the interest in automobiles but there are so many more choices available to people."

1632,"August 14, 2015  7:07PM",markcincinnati,"breld: My S4 is a mechanical device and, like all such devices, isn't perfect. Having said that, I am now north of 32,000 miles and, other than springing perhaps a little early for new tires, have nothing negative to report with respect to reliability, drive-ability, performance or efficiency.  I ordered mine with A/S tires, which does set the top speed limit (which can be changed with a keystroke or two) to 130MPH. Mine is a Premium+ model (DSG 7-speed transmission) with MMI/Navigation Plus, Audi-side assist, full leather [no alcantara inserts] seats (in red), B&O sound system/speakers, Audi-care and Carbon Fiber interior trim. It, with shipping, came to ~$57K; and I paid 94% of sticker (member of the Audi Club of NA, discount of 6%).  At my own option, I have doubled the # of oil changes (I go in every 5,000 miles, meaning I pay for every-other oil change.) I have had the car mini detailed twice and a full-on inside and outside detail once (in the 22 or 23 months since I got it). I swapped the OE tires for Conti's Extreme Contact DWS/06's a couple thousand miles ago and the handling took a very big step up and road noise, already low, dropped even further.  I would get another one -- without any question (assuming the price doesn't shoot up like Cadillac did to the CTS line). I see no reason NOT to keep it until at least 90,000+ miles (based on its complete lack of any issues, thus far.)  I have no clue if these cars hold their value better than or worse than whatever they might be shopped against -- my sense is at $57K, I would have had to take a lesser-contented BMW 335i x-drive. We've had 3 BMW's and this Audi feels more powerful than any i6 BMW we've had, but since the Audi is supercharged, this may not be a fair comparison.  I wish the back seat had at least 1"" additional leg room, but since my 22 pound Sheltie is usually the only rear seat passenger, it is not really a show stopper; besides the next gen ""A4/S4"" family will grow in size somewhat, so, again, if I knew then what I know now, I would, without hesitation repeat the acquisition of an S4.  My complaints -- ONE; the car came with WiFi based on T-Mobile 3G technology. If I actually could find and keep a 3G signal (instead, mine is mostly at 2G), I would be fine with the WiFi performance. Ultimately, my dealer showed me a secret method of adapting the carrier from T-Mobile to AT&T with some software coding and a new SIMM chip -- I am now, always in 3G. I read somewhere that the 2016 A4/S4's will offer 4G LTE radios, solving the T-Mobile (in our geography) performance issues.  Love the feature of being able to Google a destination by voice and having the sat nav take you there -- all hands free.  Love the instant response of the power, the 7-speed DSG and the tuneage from the B&O speakers.  Regrets? Wish I had gone the extra $1,000 for the Sport Differential (Audi's name for torque vectoring).  After driving an S4, you will -- upon sliding behind the wheel of almost any other car -- wonder if the different car than the S4 is, somehow, broke. The 3.0T motor is damn near electric in feel as it whisks you effortlessly from 0 to 60, just about the time you reach the end of your . . . driveway. Ruh Roh!  Hope this helps.  P.S. I am not too much of a believer that ""new models"" are prone to first-year glitches; I am a believer, however, that often the last year of a model's life-cycle provides the least amount of problems, often the greatest amount of content for the dollars spent and a pretty good chance of a deeper discount since there are no secrets. In other words, there will be a new, B9, A4/S4 model -- MY 2017. The 2016's, therefore will have to have more content and a better deal in order to help dealers clear out the ""old"" inventory thus making room for the new. Audi, I believe, has taken to delaying the availability of the new model until a certain threshold of sales of the old model has passed, therefore providing some ""value support"" both for the dealers and ultimately, of course, the buyers.  Discounts will be there for 2016 A4/S4's -- but don't expect to see a $58,000 S4 for $48K just because there is a new 2017 in the pipeline."

1644,"August 15, 2015  2:08AM",markcincinnati,"I had a 2005 A6 3.2 -- it was TorSen. As far as I know, all [quattro] Audi's that use a ""north south"" engine (longitudinal) are equipped with a TorSen system, not Haldex. Audi TT's and some A3 models (and VW golfs) had east west engines and utilized Haldex mechanisms.  Early Audis with the TorSen system were 50 50 torque split, Haldex systems were typically 90 10 (F R) splits.  In the US, at least, almost all Audis sold for the past couple of decades have been quattros and almost all of them have been TorSen, culminating in the cars using TorSen having a REAR biased AWD design. The sport differential (rear only) further enabled Audis so equipped to mitigate the understeer prevalent in cars (like Audis) with their engines ahead of the front axle.  TorSen AWD systems have many positives but at the cost of added weight.  Currently Audi continues to balance the weight of many of its cars to be less nose heavy than in the past.  As far as I know, TorSen AWD systems are the only systems that ""bind in real time"" -- meaning they do not react, they just act -- essentially eliminating the torque shift lag time of other reactive systems.  In day to day use, I have to wonder, however, if most of us mere mortals can actually tell the difference between symmetrical and asymmetrical (rear biased) systems -- although I do believe it is quite possible to tell you're driving an essentially FWD car that happens to be able to shift power aft (Acura and Volvo spring to mind).  Even so, an Acura TLX with SH-AWD can do a pretty good imitation of an S4 much of the time -- in the clutch, so to speak, however, the FWD biased systems often still feel more FWD than AWD to me.  I certainly have nuttin' but respect for Subaru; however, I would suspect most folks shopping for a $60K S4 or BMW 340ix probably don't venture into a Subaru showroom -- but, as usual, I remain, ""often wrong, but never uncertain."""

I assume the possibility and perhaps the probability that Porsche and Lambo may ""do awd better than Audi"" but the thing is, even these two super-car brands are all part of the same family. The Lambo system appears to be in a leadership position what with electronic control of all three differentials.  But, my ""assertion"" was in the context of the LPS and ELLPS world we rage on about here on this forum.  Techie in nature:    More entertaining and a bit of a history lesson:    Here is another assertion, but this one is not based on any experience or real study of the brand:  In the class of cars (""economy car"", according to Car & Driver) Subaru typically is placed, Subaru does AWD better than any of its competitors. My only reason for such a conclusion is that Subaru has demonstrated its almost fanatical dedication to AWD and, over the years, at least one of its cars, the WRX, has been praised as the Japanese S4.  The differences and similarities are discussed and dissected here in this comparison of a 2015 WRX to a 2010 S4.  New vs. Old: 2015 Subaru WRX vs. 2010 Audi S4:The new WRX meets an older version of what it aspires to be.  http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/new-vs-old-2015-subaru-wrx-vs-2010-audi-s4-comparison-test  Now for the fine print: Today, as a practical matter, several [many?] companies manufacture and market great AWD cars. It is also true that Audi has been doing this for decades (in some cases decades longer than other's in its class), meaning others have been at this nowhere near as long.  Yet technology has progressed sufficiently that the market may not perceive anything more than subtle differences between Audi's, BMW's, Lexus', Volvo's or Subaru's approach to AWD; but those who make their living knowing about the differences and the subtleties, regularly praise Audi's approach as very significant and often superior. Of course, in all fairness, many of the enthusiast magazines and their editors and staff now spend more ink describing the overall performance of the cars they review than they do on describing and detailing how one AWD choice differs, is better or worse, than another.  Often wrong, but never uncertain, I say: ""Nobody does AWD better than Audi."""

He also said dealers will be measured on how well they accomplish those last two objectives. Cadillac has 928 dealers in the U.S. who sold 165,000 vehicles last year, compared with 282 Audi dealers who sold 182,000 cars, or less than one-third as many dealers.  ""The reality, particularly in the U.S. is that the quality of the Cadillac dealer network does significantly trail that of our competitors,"" deNysschen said. http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2015/08/12/cadillac/31518823/"

1657,"August 13, 2015  1:14PM",markcincinnati,"   http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2015/08/12/cadillac/31518823/    A Day in the Life  Due to our on-again, off-again “hobby” – getting educated about a somewhat eclectic number of automotive brands – my wife and I have had the experience of visiting dealerships and interacting with many current auto models and their sales representatives. Included in this list: Jeep, Chrysler, GMC and, of course, Cadillac. Of course we’ve also experienced Acura, Audi, BMW, Infiniti, Lexus, Mercedes and Volvo, too. But, in response to DeNysschen’s “warning” to GM’s top brass, I can now reflect on what seems to be a different “approach” prospective customers will enjoy when shopping at the dealership of, apparently most, American automotive brands.  Have you ever heard of or seen a TV show called “WKRP in Cincinnati?” If so, you will have a somewhat more well-rounded perspective of the Herb Tarlek approach. I want to make sure you understand my remarks are a caricature – an exaggeration. You see, Mr. Tarlek is the sales manager of the fictional Cincinnati radio station WKRP – and he is, well, terrible. His behavior qualifies him to be called either a jerk or a jackass. His behavior and customer’s interactions with him often seem vaguely slimy, borderline unethical and disreputable. Further, it appears that Mr. Tarlek has a problem with women, often calling them “hon’” and usually ignoring them altogether, if they are with a man.  Pulling into the lot of [even] a Cadillac dealership, the gentleman sporting a white belt and white shoes barely allows customers to exit their vehicles before invading their personal space and asking them if their “time-frame” is today (since he’s already below his quota and needs to only spend time with customers who will sign and drive NOW.)  Then, you are guided to – apparently – the vehicle with the spiffs on it and “encouraged” to take a test drive. You are required to allow your driver’s license to be photocopied and you may even have to produce proof of insurance. Then, the rep gets into the back seat in order to answer any questions that may arise during the test drive.  And so it goes – you can’t wait to get out of there, for, during the test drive the chatter from the back seat is incessant, pressing you for “what’ll it take” to get you to close the deal today.  Come to think of it, this isn’t as much of a caricature as I had intended.  I don’t know if these dealer reps ever shop for cars anywhere else to “see how it is done elsewhere,” but the evidence suggests this is not the case.  On top of way too many dealers, DeNysschen has his work cut out for him – I suspect he’ll be incredibly popular with the dealers (uh huh).  Unless I knew exactly what I wanted and could pretty much handle the entire transaction over the Internet, I don’t know why folks willing and able to plunk down sums often way north of $50,000 put up with this kind of behavior – oh wait, apparently not enough of them do.  Swallow your pride and see if there’s any openings at Audi, Mr. DeNysschen. Cadillac may just be, if not a lost cause, in possession of too much inertia."
1658,"August 13, 2015  2:43PM",wayne21,You are required to allow your driver’s license to be photocopied and you may even have to produce proof of insurance.  The reason dealerships want a copy of your driver's license is so they run a credit check on you.
1659,"August 13, 2015  3:00PM",qbrozen,"No. Credit check can't be pulled from your DL number. They want to make sure you have a valid DL, first of all, before letting you drive their car on their insurance. They also want ID in case you run off with their car. Seems pretty reasonable."
1660,"August 13, 2015  3:24PM",markcincinnati,"The premium car dealerships (we've visited) rarely ask for documentation prior to a test drive -- I dunno, maybe they size up the customer based on the car they drive in. Also, arriving as a couple probably doesn't hurt either.  Running a credit check from your DL? My SSN is NOT on my DL. I suspect there may be other ways to do this, but, one more thing: if a credit check is run through one of the three commercial CB's, there is an ""inquiry"" posted to the formula used to determine your score. Should you have a credit check or worse, multiple credit checks, there is the distinct possibility of a hit (negative) on your scores.  Applying for a credit check -- especially without your knowledge would not be a good practice.  Please note, my comments were meant to suggest a fundamental difference between the experience we customers face at a Premium European or Japanese vs even a Premium American brand.  Actually, since the Cadillac dealer we frequent is next to the Audi dealer where we buy regularly, we are usually just given the keys with the comment, ""take your time.""  The overall spirit of what I was commenting about was to underscore DeNysschen's comments. Really, I am pulling for him and for Cadillac. Sometimes, though, it must seem almost like a lost cause. If he can survive, I would assume he could make Cadillac thrive. It's a long row to hoe, however."

I don't think it's the guy's ego problem. If anything, it's GM's past and present hubris and running the brand to the ground, before he even joined them. They guy is simply telling how he sees they should look in the future. He may be wrong here and there and perhaps not fully get all the fixes right, but it's simply unsustainable the way it is right now. The problem is the constituency, both in the company and the dealers simply is too myopic to see it and attached to old ways. In essence, he has no chance, not because his being wrong, but because there is too much to change and too few interested in the change. Simple declaring bankruptcy, shedding assets and contracts is just a start, not the end of restructuring. Cadillac has a network to sell million cars a year and the product that sells less than half of that with sales are barely moving up in the aggregate, falling in key segments. Essentially a burning platform, to use Elop's language about Nokia. I unfortunately think they may end up like Nokia, too. Perhaps it will take longer."

That is not going to happen. The buyers of those cars are loyal and dedicated, and very few of them will ever consider a Cadillac—especially if it costs more money.  I'm trying to figure this out, but I see from GM's webpage (and even though he's spending their money hand over fist on his experiment, he's at the same time trying to distance himself from them?) that he grew up in South Africa. He also, as we know, worked for a long time for Audi, and then for Infiniti.  http://www.gm.com/content/gmcom/home/company/aboutGM/GM_Corporate_Officers/johan_nysschen.html  Essentially, Johan de N. doesn't seem to have much of a clue about who buys Cadillacs. The Cadillac buyer wants American luxury, performance, and style—but not at a nosebleed price. They either won't pay that much—or can't.  Cadillac has already moved upmarket in the last 15 years. And that's a good thing. But these new moves don't seem rational to me or to some other people.  For instance, would Audi owner markcincinnati be willing to pay *more* than an Audi for a Cadillac? I don't think so.  And now Johan de Nosebleedprysschen is insulting his own dealer network.  ?  Bet the dislike for him at the grassroots dealer level is swelling like a Fukushima tsunami....

1668,"August 13, 2015  7:19PM",markcincinnati," Had the car for 6 months -- has 103K miles on it (how many did it have 6 months ago)? What was paid for the car 6-months ago (was it picked up below retail market? If so, how much below retail market)? Let's just say it was picked up from a private individual ""as is"" and was offered up at $2K below retail market -- that would suggest a still healthy but less so investment of ""only"" $3K in repairs vs what could have been, should have been, etc.  Are we counting such things as ""tires, brake pads, struts, rotors, cabin-filters, wheel-alignment and wiper blades"" as repairs? The last time I had to pay for a cabin filter it was a multi-hundred dollar affair, all in.  Is this car this person's first BMW or first high-mileage European car? My neighbor with 80,000 miles on a Pontiac (don't know the age), said the car was a money vacuum, in that it sucked all his money out of his checkbook. Most folks, these days are WARY of buying high-mileage cars that are breathtakingly expensive to repair and maintain.  And: How many times have we here said European cars are breathtakingly expensive to own out of warranty? Answer, about 139,659 times on this forum alone. Of course, you can be forgiven if you didn't read this board backwards to 2002. Really, we'll let that pass.  Key question, was a full, complete, total, non-free inspection performed on the car prior to purchase; if so what did the inspection reveal -- you would think such an inspection would've picked up something that would have caused it to burn through $5K worth of ""repairs"" (see maintenance comment above), perhaps?  Whenever anyone I know asks me for my advice or opinion regarding a used-car purchase, I typically urge them to spend the money for a non-biased, not-free inspection from a specialist enterprise. Here in RiverCity, there are several BMW or German or European repair houses (not dealer affiliated) who for a 3-figure number will put together a report on the used car you are lusting for, outlining the expected near term costs of ownership.  I always seem to get someone here upset at me when I suggest it is often far cheaper (on a 12, 24, 36 or even 48 month basis) to lease a brand new, with warranty (and often maintenance-included) car than it is to buy a used one with the potential of requiring huge sums of money just to keep it running.  What would a 2007 335i go for? Locally a new 3-series can be leased often for a number beginning with a 3. Often Accords can be had for even less, try $219/mo for a strippie for 27 months.  And (if it is a BMW) that mo/pmt includes the maintenance and free (well, you know) repairs for 50,000 miles. It seems to me to be hard to compete with these sub-vented leases, unless for some reason you think you are making an ""investment"" in a declining-value asset -- and even with BMW's that's a hard argument to win.  Going to an Accord, per se, is not a bad thing or a dumb thing to do -- in fact, such a move may very well be a good and smart thing to do; but unless the Accord in question is 100% new with factory warranty and any mntce program that may accompany it, the same rule of thumb would apply -- get the damn thing rigorously inspected before buying/leasing/financing/acquiring.  Some of us are ""types."" After dozes of German cars, my wife and I each went with Infiniti [her] and Acura [me]; we liked the cars for the most part, but it was really quite difficult to build up much passion or, actually, any emotion. My cousin, ""Mr. Honda or Mr. Mazda and now Mr. KIA,"" tried out a German and, although it was no trouble, he just seemed to resent (?) the fact that he had to interact with the car -- he just couldn't get into the ""don't forget to breathe"" tag line sign hanging low and large at the local BMW dealership.  Maybe it is telling -- I am not certain ""what"" it is telling, however -- that the BMW's ouster will be followed not by another German or European or even Premium car, but by a Honda Accord. Again, there is nothing wrong with Accord's, but I would typically think folks who like BMW's unlikely to shop Honda's. Were I in the same situation, I would likely be looking to get right back on the horse and, if possible, get a younger -- or new -- BMW."

Where is he/she getting it serviced and repaired? If the shop is incompetent the repairs may be unneeded or the problems may not have been properly diagnosed. BMWs don't tolerate cutting corners with dodgy aftermarket parts.

Moreover, based on our experience, Infiniti knows how to build a reliable and -- I would extrapolate -- durable car. However, it is a premium car and if it does need repairs, out of warranty they won't be cheap (maintenance, however, will probably cost less for an Infiniti than for a BMW or Audi, for example). At 39 months, however, I would probably have very very low concern, especially if I planned to do 39 months and move onto the next.  Whatever you do, should you go previously owned, get the thing inspected and do yourself a favor, shop the used car against a new one if monthly payment and TOC (total operating costs) are of concern -- then after you have the data, make your move."

It's the numbers on the fringes that can really muck up the meaning of average. My interest would be in knowing a bit more. I mean it, BMW, as we all know, stands for Beauty, Money and Wealth -- and in my experience the BMW owners, shoppers and drivers are YOUNG and possess beauty, money and wealth. Finding out that BMW buyers are older than Audi buyers bursts my bubble.  Buick and Lincoln's numbers, however, seem to fit my perceptions, on the other hand."

1693,"August 12, 2015 11:32AM",robr2, Aw c'mon now. These are more than badge jobs. They are shared platforms with little shared outside of that. Should we chastise VW for sharing an 8 year old platform between the current A4 and the new Porsche Macan?
1694,"August 12, 2015 12:26PM",Michaell, I suppose not.
1695,"August 12, 2015  1:06PM",dino001,"I'm not against platform sharing, that's a fact of life today. It's about making cars different enough. There are examples of successful platform sharing, such as VAG, where to various degree there are shared components between Skoda, Seat, VW, Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini and Bugatti, but the brands have enough identity and uniqueness between each other. A domestic example of a successful platform sharing would be Cadillac Escalade - regardless how much detest Cadillac's marketing of this vehicle (the commercial with Pharao, Raja, Louis-X??? could easily be in top 3 most offensive and obnoxious ever), it has enough separation from GMC. An example for the opposite also comes from Cadillac - Cimarron.  GM's overall track record of putting different badges on practically identical vehicles makes me, should I say, skeptical. They got better, recently. I think Buicks seem to be regaining their own identity, but seems GM is slowly falling back into its old ways - unrealistic expectations, lots of puffery, and lack of support of their dealers, see Graphic's CTS saga, which seems to stem from multiple dealers' unwillingness to troubleshoot the car without a fault code, which is most likely because GM's refusal to give them enough leeway to work the problem first. They can't win luxury market customers, if their dealers act this way, but they do that because of the toxic relationships. Moreover, there are probably too many stores for the brand to be truly upscale.  So they trump half million sales target in 5 years, which is high teens growth each year, every year, with currently crashing sales in some key US segments. I understand, big part of the growth is supposed to come from China, which I think is OK, even if recent news suggest a calamity unfolding there (I think it's way overstated).  How do you grow sales, when in fact you need to shrink the store count and apply more discipline? It's all completely inconsistent. As I said before, it's a ten year project with very difficult first three-four years and no guarantee for a success. They are unwilling to swallow that bitter pill (what's new about that), they'd rather do what they have always done - peacocking, unrealistic baffoonery. Seems like the bankruptcy taught them absolutely nothing. Looks like the new outsider guy fits their old mold quite well."
1696,"August 12, 2015  1:51PM",markcincinnati,"It -- perhaps superficially -- appears that Cadillac is emulating the SONY approach. Sony, a few short decades ago was the big buck TV (and later there were many other Sony branded electronics). Back in the day when big name department stores would sell TVs, a shopper could be in selection mode and see a sea of Zenith, RCA, Admiral and even Mitsubishi TVs -- often the Sony family of TVs was separated from the other brands; and, always the Sony brand in whatever size you were shopping for was more expensive. Time passed. Sony proliferated the brand and began lowering prices. Or did the competition creep their prices upward?  Eventually Sony showed up in Walmart along side other ""perceived lesser"" brands -- regardless of the price erosion, Sony did keep the image of being the Premium Brand.  Lexus, on the other hand, produced a premium automobile, said to be comparable to Mercedes, and charged 20% less. Over time, Lexus was able to inflate the MSRP of the cars to near parity with the premium Germans.  Two approaches -- both appear to work to carve out market share.  Cadillac seems to be working the Sony model -- price the product more dearly, take the chance that the market will perceive the brand in an increasingly positive light -- ""Cadillac is back."" This is time consuming, expensive and probably WILL WORK ""if"" there is sufficient shareholder and executive management patience to ""not quit before the miracle.""  The Lexus -- Land Grab -- approach also has its merits. In a B2C model, I would assume the Lexus approach seems ""intuitively"" to be lower risk. But, the brand will take a period of time to build up the desired perception. Again, corporate and shareholder patience will be required, but since there will be volume, shareholders may think the ""miracle"" is closer than it may ultimately prove to have been.  You can't enact either approach if your masters fire you though.  The investors -- a somewhat different group than the shareholders -- probably prefer raising prices, since the brand's equity (if the approach works) will certainly be built up.  Oddly, in my perception, Audi took the Lexus approach (sort of), but I could argue the ""unintended acceleration"" situation that befell Audi after the 60-Minutes story, FORCED Audi to discount their cars just to remain relevant in the US (remember the days when select prospects received a $5,000 check that could be applied to the Audi 5000 (which became the A6) linup. The approach would seem to be that the MSRP was not discounted, but you were given an up-front rebate.  So Cadillac is taking the approach of selling cars that are priced higher -- the Sony approach to market share, sort of.  Of course the dealer body has to be convinced along with the customers that this is a long game and worth playing. The dealers, so it appears, are not exactly warming to this approach, however.  We'll see."
1697,"August 12, 2015  2:12PM",dino001,"Where is Sony now? Sony started higher because they used to have a product that was at least arguably better and most innovative. Later on they stopped innovating, diluted the brand. Sony is a shadow of its old self. To wish Cadillac to go Sony way is to basically wish it to die slow and painful death.  Plus, pricing product higher you have to acknowledge the expected hit in volume. They are claiming the opposite. That's what is not making sense."
1698,"August 12, 2015  3:14PM",Mr_Shiftright,"Cadillac seems to be revising their pricing structure for 2016, so I think they're getting the message that they have to set a price about $10K below MB and Lexus."
1699,"August 12, 2015  3:25PM",dino001, Can you elaborate? Are they lowering prices by large increments? This would certainly be interesting news.
1700,"August 12, 2015  3:35PM",qbrozen,"Granted, I have not gone through the trouble of trying to build like cars, but the CTS starts at $5k less than the 5-series. The 6-cylinders start about $2k apart, so, OK, not so great there. But then you are back to a $5k delta with the V sport vs 550i. The CTS already starts nearly $9k less than its E-class counterparts.  The ATS 2.5 is a mistake that should have been killed at birth. Yes, the ATS is only about $1k less than the 3-series counterparts on starting price. The C class, however, is $2k more for the 4-cyl turbo and $6k more for the 6-cyl. An ATS-V is about $3500 less than the starter C63 and $1500 under the M3.  So it seems to me they have a bit more work to do on ATS pricing than CTS, although the sales of the CTS would indicate otherwise."
1701,"August 12, 2015  3:43PM",Mr_Shiftright,Well we're getting a hint of it in the New CTS-V Sticker Price. 
1702,"August 12, 2015  3:59PM",dino001," Those all are too small differentials. They should be such that even after a customary dealer's discount at BMW or Benz, there is still a healthy distance to the STICKER of the Cady. At least for now. The CTS-to-5 series move was correct in general terms, but it should take 10 years, not just one sweep. The sticker shock from previous year was simply too big. There is a history showing such big moves never work. You can't ""declare"" yourself worthy of the price - that's something that comes after years. Lexus knew it and where are they now. Even now one part of their appeal is that they are a value proposition to the Germans - much less of a discount than before, nevertheless they are still cheaper, especially in higher reaches of their respective models. They have a simpler lineup, so there are gaps in comparison, but within comparable models and equipment, the prices are still lower."
1703,"August 12, 2015  4:09PM",robr2," Back in January, Cadillac cut the MSRP on the CTS anywhere from $1-3,000."
1704,"August 12, 2015  4:21PM",markcincinnati,"Configuring a, for example, 5 series with X,Y & Z features and options and attempting to do the same configuration of a CTS is a good way to determine if Cadillac is going after the land grab.  I have no wish for Cadillac to emulate my historical perspective of Sony's playbook. I observed some evidence that was the approach that seemed to materialize coincidental with the birth of the current CTS.  For the most part, I would say I favor the Lexus LS400 approach -- build a comparable car (comparable to Mercedes is the popular conception) and price it so compellingly that it is difficult for customers NOT to shop it.  In some respects, it appears KIA has set its sights on the Premium (including entry-level premium) Class and is using the land grab approach. It's sibling company coming out with the Equus, too, seems like a similar approach. Don't know how it's going with the Equus as it, unlike Lexus, doesn't have a dedicated dealer body. That worked out well for the Phaeton in the US, eh?  My board is always after me to raise the prices of our software products -- doing so, we experienced growth -- slow growth. We changed the strategy to buy one, get one and sales (revenue) literally doubled. Of course my business is B2B, but in the end, the purchases are made by a human, in either a commercial or retail setting, so I assume there is some carry over.  If you want to build market share, go land grab and raise prices slowly over time. If you want to build gross margin -- PER TRANSACTION -- raise the price, but remember the risk is that revenue will likely drop for some period of time (years, in some cases).  The economic reality seems, for cars -- unless you're Lambo or Porsche, or another already high-priced established product, etc -- to favor land grab, if you're trying to build or, in Cadillac's place, re-build a brand.  I think, in part, BMW has mastered this -- they have created an aspirational brand. Everywhere you turn (we have two BMW dealers in Cincinnati who seem to churn out a couple hundred new BMW owners every month) you see ""yourself"" in [generally speaking] a new 3-series; then, when you've finally ""arrived"" you immediately go to the BMW Store or Sweeny and pick up your new symbol of success.  A few years ago, I read an article that said ""Everyone wants to be BMW;"" last year, if you can believe Car & Driver, et al, the headline was ""Everyone wants to be Audi."" Of course the ""Everyone"" was speaking of Audi or BMW's rivals du jour.  Hopefully Cadillac will keep improving the product and will figure out someway to make the cars be perceived as ""worth the asking price.""  Tick-tock."
1705,"August 12, 2015  4:32PM",dino001,"Lexus worked, because it was a separate brand. If Hyundai went as far as creating a new brand with separate dealer network, the land grab could work. Selling 70K limousine next to 15K econobox is actually a very difficult proposition. However, the former requires lots of time, resources and patience. The latter can be tried and abandoned in one cycle."
1706,"August 12, 2015  5:10PM",nyccarguy,@robr2 - I had NO idea the MACAN shared it's platform with the current A4. Learn something new every day!
1707,"August 12, 2015  5:24PM",flightnurse," As someone who worked at Sony during the heyday, the writing was on the wall when I left in 97, every segment Sony was in, they had the top model, but when the walkman died, so did a lot of other products, Thier laptop's had many problems and durability was a problem, Sony wouldn't give up on the DAT player for Car Audio or BETA video recorder, two complete failures. Then Sony cheapened the brand by out sourcing products to be manufacturers in Mexico, other brands were getting better and Sony's products were getting outdated and finally other brands surpassed Sony in sales. If it wasn't for the PlayStation, I really think Sony would be a completely different company then it is today."
1708,"August 12, 2015  5:28PM",markcincinnati,"Technically the Macan shares about 33% of its DNA with the Audi Q5/SQ5. The two local Audi retailers happen to own Porsche dealerships -- kind of an interesting ""battle of the brands"" with shoppers cross shopping SQ5's with the base Macan. Apparently, if you know where to look, you can actually see the Audi markings on frame members of the Macan.  Of course my Audi rep thinks the Macan costs $10-$15K more than an SQ5, and has made a Sticker Comparison to demonstrate that.  Frankly, having driven both of them, my take is that for once the Audi interior is second to the Macan's and the Macan has noticeably lower ground clearance. From a power perspective, the Audi has both more HP and torque, but the Porsche's torque, derived as it is from turbo charging comes on at a lower RPM.  The SQ5, were it to offer the German Market lowered suspension (which it does not, here in the US), seems to be more car for the money -- but, ahem, what price the Porsche medallion? The Porsche uses a 7-speed dual clutch unit and the SQ5 uses an 8-speed tiptronic with software that does a pretty good impression of a dual clutch feel.  Lots of options available on the Macan -- and those options can crank a Macan over $100,000. Our lowly SQ5 Prestige with a couple of options and in Panther Black with red leather seats came in at $65,000.  Despite the similarities, there are obvious Porsche touches that are included in that 67% uniqueness -- and while you may argue their value-prop, they certainly do imbue the Macan with Porsche-ness; and, no amount of leather or paint will make the SQ5 a Porsche.  You may cross shop them and I'm certain the country-club valet will give either car you hop out of nothing other than a ton of respect (and will likely avert his eyes), but one, after all is a friggin' Porsche.  Drive it like you live.  NB: My wife decided the SQ5 would be a repeat, primarily because she likes being a bit higher off the ground and because the back seat of the Macan takes a big hit in headroom and cargo space in exchange for having a swoopy rear-end. The Audi, then, gets a nod toward ""practicality"" if you can imagine hauling groceries in a $65,000 Supercharged 354HP 346 ft/lb Torque ""CUV Hot-rod!"""

Of course, when I was looking at the S4 and 428i this past weekend, we went right by a MB dealer and I decided not to stop and look at the C-class. So not sure what that says.

1714,"August 10, 2015  9:09PM",markcincinnati," Sometimes I just cringe when someone calls me sir -- I think it heralds the beginning of the end.  I was driving into the office today and made an attempt (1/2 hour commute) to note the age of the driver of every Mercedes I saw. I only saw E's and S's, but I did see a double digit number. I did not make any attempt to categorize by gender or apparent ethnicity. My memory says I saw only two ethnic groups represented ""black and white"" -- and of course two genders.  What struck me was the apparent fact that the E's and S's were all AWD versions and were all driven by what certainly appeared to me to be people beyond their 50's. Is this observation in any way statistically significant? Probably not, but it could be, at least, an interesting data-point. I drive through mostly upper-middle income neighborhoods on my commute, FWIW.  Before you think I've gone off some rail here, I was having a conversation with a friend about cars and the subject of Cadillac came up -- his comment was that they remain cars that attract ""mature"" owners, retired folk, apparently in his view.  The article above about the efforts of the new Cadillac President to change the behavior (mentality) of dealers made me think he was onto something. Cadillac dealers don't act like Audi, BMW and Mercedes dealers -- and they still paint prices on the windshields of the cars on their lots (I make it a practice to avoid dealers who paint prices on the windshield of the cars on their lot, I fear them, frankly.)  My perception is that BMW has the youngest drivers of the German Premium Crowd, closely followed by Audi (but that may be because of the Q5's success -- and that it would appear Q5's have a relatively young owner-set.) Audi, too, with the A3/S3 may be trolling for ever younger owners.  But, that still leaves me with the observation -- this morning -- that the E and S class Mercs were AWD and all driven by, apparently, Baby Boomers, current Xer's and Millennial's weren't participating this AM, at least.  Here I am 64, driving an S4 -- I guess I should be in what -- an A6 or CTS or perhaps a 5 series or should it be an XTS Cadillac. Wondering what, if any, studies of the age of owners exists -- with all the focus on Millennials and away from us Boomers, these days, it would seem to be some valuable data.  Ever notice the current crop of Buick ads wherein the ""little ol' lady"" remarks ""Oh MY!"" when she is told she's in a new Buick. Is that a nod toward the past or is that a convoluted way of suggesting that new Buicks will be appreciated by those of a certain maturity and perhaps even attractive to them?  Wondering if part of the issue confronting some car mfgrs, could be they need to make their cars seem to be desired by Millennials.  Maybe on the way home, I'll count BMW drivers."

I went the Audi route when all my friends went with BMW's because #1 the Audi brand had quattro and #2, I always felt you could buy the next higher line of Audi for the same price as the lower line BMW, so I thought the value and performance leader was always Audi (you could say, too, I guess, I was, ahem, more frugal than my BMW lovin' friends).  But back to the math -- an average age of 60 does not mean the majority of buyers are over 60. There isn't enough information to know, if all you know is the ""average."" Mean, Mode, Median, Range and while were at it Standard Deviation, on the other hand would paint a much clearer picture of the number of ""old timers"" buying a particular automotive brand.  I have one more data point -- every Corvette that I have seen FOR YEARS seems to be piloted by a driver who either looks like Bill Clinton or Bill Cosby (speaking ONLY of a certain appearance that suggests age, not lasciviousness.)  But the car seems to be marketed to a much younger person, if you have ever seen an ad or brochure."

I'll forgive some of that based on giving due respect. Overall, he's a pretty bright guy.  He sort of painted his time at GM as him against the big car establishment. Not sure how much is true and how much is bluster. But, he got the company to take chances (i.e. ""new"" GTO, Solstice and Sky....too bad they were products of failed divisions). He derided the Aztec. He tried to move GM. Wasn't entirely successful, but is willing to admit he wasn't, too.  Colleague bought a new IS 350 F Sport. I've always liked those. I test drove one a year or so ago. If anything, I like them more after seeing his (darkish grey with red leather interior). Hard to fault the build of it....probably the best I've seen. Still, a little cramped. Maybe that's because I've been used to driving cars a bit bigger than the IS. Seats are wonderful. Just a very, very nice car that goes well, drives well, and is built extremely well. His MSRP sticker said $49K....quite loaded up. He said they discounted his by about $2,500.

1746,"August  7, 2015 11:29PM",benjaminh,"Another story on Cadillac:  http://www.autonews.com/article/20150807/RETAIL/150809864/cadillac-works-to-revise-dealer-incentives   Mike Colias RSS feed Automotive News August 7, 2015 - 1:54 pm ET ELKHART LAKE, Wis. -- Two main elements of Johan de Nysschen’s plan to rehabilitate Cadillac’s image are to tighten dealers’ inventories and quash their sell-at-any-cost mentality.  There’s a big problem though: Cadillac’s dealer-incentive programs today are designed to do just the opposite. One makes cash payouts for growing sales; the other attaches up to $700 in dealer bonus money to every vehicle they order from the factory.  De Nysschen, Cadillac’s president, says those programs must change for dealers to adopt a true luxury mindset, one based on an engaging customer experience, rather than sales volume.  “The business model has been structured more for the bigger brands inside General Motors, rather than the small Cadillac brand,” de Nysschen said here at a test drive event for the media. “The luxury business is different.”  He said Cadillac is in talks with its national dealer council “to develop the next generation of what these programs should look like for Cadillac.”  It’s an example of the obstacles de Nysschen faces in reshaping Cadillac’s retail network into something that more closely resembles those of German luxury brands such as BMW or Audi. Most of Cadillac’s more than 900 dealerships are hard-wired to carry far more inventory than other luxury stores, often moving the metal through deep discounts.  A Midwest Cadillac dealer, who didn’t want to be identified discussing factory business, believes it would be difficult for many dealers to fathom an incentive program that’s not tied to sales performance.  “There’s only one thing that matters, and it’s selling more cars,” said the dealer, who said he sells a couple dozen Cadillacs a month. “I did not come in here today to buy more digital stuff for the showroom.”  (more at the link)"
1747,"August  8, 2015 12:04AM",dino001,"He makes sense, but only if they close more than half of the dealers and limit the production. They'll run him from town first. Too many vested interest. No chance. This is a ten year program with constituance having patience for a couple of quarters."
1748,"August  8, 2015 12:52AM",roadburner,"For the most part, the typical Cadillac dealer is simply not prepared to sell cars to customers that still have all their own teeth..."
1749,"August  8, 2015  1:55AM",dino001,"It's not about the age, it's about customer experience philosophy. My feels is Cadillac's dealers are mentally closer to Toyota's, Vokswagen's than to Lexus's, or Audi's. Part of that is the past, part is the financial structure and the way they are are compensated by the parent company."
1750,"August  8, 2015  1:58AM",flightnurse," GC, Lutz was also Rogers Smiths Yes man, and we all know what Roger Smith did GM...  The IS cars are smaller then their competitor which is a negative for me.  When it comes to Business read, my top read is NUTZ, by Herb Keller."
1751,"August  8, 2015  4:32AM",markcincinnati,"8 Years? Really?  Check out this headline: ""Knowledge Doubling Every 12 Months, Soon to be Every 12 Hours""!  While you're at it, check out any number of sources on the subject line ""Moore's law"": The observation that the number of transistors in a dense integrated circuit has doubled approximately every two years.  ""Buckminster Fuller created the “Knowledge Doubling Curve”; he noticed that until 1900 human knowledge doubled approximately every century. By the end of World War II knowledge was doubling every 25 years. Today things are not as simple as different types of knowledge have different rates of growth. For example, nanotechnology knowledge is doubling every two years and clinical knowledge every 18 months. But on average human knowledge is doubling every 13 months. According to IBM, the build out of the “internet of things” will lead to the doubling of knowledge every 12 hours.""  OK, so where oh where is this going?  This is going to the subject of why the refresh cycles of cars (German ones at least) seems to be (especially for Audi and BMW) 8 years.  Sure there are ""mid-cycle"" refreshes, but often what happens is some minor styling tweaks, perhaps an MPG increase and certainly an increase in ""content"" -- but, often content increases annually (sometimes for a bump in price) anyway, or at least there is a rejiggering of option package features.  What if Apple came out with a truly new phone once every 8 years? What if Lenovo or Dell only coughed up a new PC or server even as long as every 4 years? There are numerous other examples across many products and brands that would literally just drop dead if they didn't substantially change (one likes to think enhance and improve) their products much more frequently than 8 or 4 or even 2 years.  Given current technology advancements, check that, given the speed (and frequency) of technology advancements how is it that several significant car manufacturers only really offer more than evolutionary changes every 8-years?  And while incremental changes continue in years 2,3,4,5,6,7 and 8, it is -- as far as I can tell -- literally impossible to upgrade your year 2 version with year 6 features, for any realistic sum of money (and in some cases it is less money to replace your 5 year old BMW with a new one than even dream of [analogy] pulling out the old SIMM chip and replacing it with a new one.)  So much of our cars DNA is based on software and a circuit board, why not allow the customer who wants to pony up the funds to upgrade his/her car's ""infotainment"" system for the one found in a newer version of his A4 or 5 series?  Is the only reason to not support an upgrade path the desire to sell new cars? Why can you keep your 20 year old aircraft current with the latest and greatest avionics, but your can't upgrade your 2 year old car's 3G wi-fi to 4G LTE for love nor money?  And the refresh cycle at 8-years? Really? Why does it take 8 years between ""versions"" of these cars? That time frame seems to me to be based on the past, not the currently reality.  I think it is time for the refresh cycle to be shortened -- I'd say, based on where things stand today, cutting the cycle in half would pretty much be a catch up move, not a pull ahead move.  The days of rendering umpteen versions of a new design in clay, destroying them and doing it all over again, are inefficient -- so much so that if anyone is actually still doing this, it would have to be almost literally ineffective.  I've seen some very impressive 3D-printing demonstrations that would seem to eliminate such by-gone days' practices -- the model upgrade can be dreamed up, coded and the printer turned on; model change costs can be slashed as can the time from thought to manufacture to market. No way 8-years is required to recoup the development costs.  Computer controlled machines can be changed to produce new body stampings, etc and every day it is not impossible to believe some engineer somewhere has figured out yet another tweak to improve both power and MPG out of the internal combustion engine -- to say nothing of alternative power-trains.  So, today's car is part mechanical, part computational, part software, part hardware -- I've kept my iPhone current, and so far each upgrade has been a real improvement. This technology is in our cars and it should be similarly updatable (the time frame, the cycle) and notable improvements should be regular and frequent -- not for free, mind you, but this 8-year cycle between serious product upgrades and updates is a practice that needs to be abandoned as soon as possible."
1752,"August  8, 2015  8:32AM",tlong,"Cars are over 100 years into their evolution and other than electronics, don't evolve at the same pace.  Smart phones are like 8 years old (if we count the iPhone as the first ""modern"" smartphone; a bit longer if you count earlier ""windows mobile"" phones). So of course the pace of evolution is much faster.  Auto volumes are also a lot lower. So it's too expensive to retool every year - unless you want to pay triple the cost. And a car represents a much higher fraction of the average owner's income, so it is not going to be replaced at the same pace as your phone.  Regarding software and automakers, this is a very new area for them. They are not that experienced in software at the consumer level. Recent security exploits show how far the automakers need to go to get to the same level of sophistication that Apple or Microsoft are at for their operating systems."
1753,"August  8, 2015  3:15PM",markcincinnati,"Opportunity Lost  My suggestion was for a cycle of ~4-years, not 1. Also, the experience of driving the automobile is, as I noted, largely based on software and circuit boards. Engine bays can almost certainly house either the tried and true and tired 3.7L (Infiniti, e.g.) or a new cleaner, more efficient and more effective powerplant (make the new stuff available now, don't wait for a new body style, i.e.) -- the point is I was only partially speaking of ""retooling."" Moreover, now that machines make machines, the cost of retooling has decreased.  But again, my request is for a compression of time for updates to the brain, heart and lungs (so to speak) of the automobile; later, or less frequently if there is a retooling argument at play, the ritual ""skin rejuvenation"" and lipo-suction can be scheduled.  Let me give a few examples of ""improvements"" that probably don't required new sheet metal to deploy (and I'll use Audi as my poster-child since I am familiar with that brand):  o Audi will wait to offer LED headlights until the B9 model (A4), but the technology has been in the ""C's"" (A6) for a couple of years. I can think of no legitimate reason this feature was withheld from the market.  o Top-view monitor, as much, or more, of an advance as the rear-view camera, has been around for years -- Audi will wait for the B9 class debuts before they offer this.  o Driver configurable dash (EFT tech), it too will have to wait for the next generation car  o 4G LTE internet connectivity -- also will have to wait, and no upgrade path is offered for older 3G radios buried in the MMI's guts. This ought to be like opening up your laptop, pulling the hard drive and replacing it with an SSD (all for $150 or less) and enjoying the performance of a no-moving-parts storage system without having to buy an entirely new PC  The list of features that could make the car perform better, be safer, have better in-car entertainment, navigation and driver assist aids do not require much, if any, retooling, but they would allow owners to keep their car's systems, on a selective basis, as current as the owner wants.  Perhaps this has little to do with capability or cost (to both the mfgr and the customer), perhaps it really is a way to compel (or at least impel) ""the market"" (you and me, perhaps, at the micro level) to trade in, trade up or just ""get new"" -- perhaps the status quo is as we know it today, to imbue aftermarket providers (SEMA) with endless opportunities to sell their wares. Who knows perhaps the mfgrs and SEMA companies are in a symbiotic relationship (I doubt they actually collude, however).  It just frustrates the ever-lovin' crap out of me to be almost unable to keep my cars as current as possible. I'd like to be able to pick and choose some of this year's features and incorporate them into my otherwise fine 3-year old.  Seems like you can put new wheels and tires on your car with ease -- and W/T combinations can provide performance, safety and styling improvements -- I just believe we have reached a point in time and technology where we ought to be able to do the same thing with the ""technology package"" most cars come standard with, these days (speaking of the PREMIUM CLASS, of course, for this and other posts).  A really big clue, to me at least, as to the lost opportunity mfgrs are ""enjoying"" is revealed over on audiworld.com where members breathlessly enthuse about the arrival (yesterday or the day before) of their new cars, then, in the next sentence, conclude ""Let the modifications begin.""  Lost opportunity if you ax me.  Sort-of unrelated: I finally met my very first non-Apple employee who was wearing an Apple Watch. As she explained it to me, it sounded pretty cool -- until she told me, that if you wanted to do almost anything other than tell time, you had to have your iPhone within about 30-50 feet of your wrist; meaning, effectively, you have to carry the phone to get much, if any, use out of the watch's smart features. I'm hereby volunteering to have an iPhone implanted -- with a charging plug inconspicuously positioned somewhere on my torso. You see: I'm looking to have empty pockets -- while they're at it, they can implant my smart car-key too (Audi keys are about the size of a small potato, for god's sake); I'd rather the car key be included with the car as a stylish and functional Mont Blanc pen. Seriously, I'm starting to list from the weight of all of the ""remotes"" and do-dads and clips and cards I carry in my pockets. Somebody help me, somebody help us all."
1754,"August  8, 2015 11:37PM",tlong,"The automakers would much rather have you buy a new car for tens of thousands rather than plug and play a few modules and keep your current vehicle for a few more years. The technology may ""be there"" to do new things sooner, but it's certainly not a no-cost proposition to continually re-tool parts as plug in replacements for previous ones. And it adds a lot of logistical complexity, too. Your headlight goes out - do you want one non-LED replacement, or two of the new LED equivalents? Let's stock duplicate sets of parts for all the different vintages and variants and versions of parts that are usable in the same basic model of car...etc. And the engineers retrofitting the LED lights to the existing Audi vehicles, the new LTE module to the existing vehicles, the new CPU to the existing vehicles - well they won't be working on designing the next model coming out in a few years then... unless you hire excess engineers for that...  The Apple watch (and Android Wear as well) are designed to be mostly peripheral devices to your phones. The battery technology just isn't there to have much power in the watch and have it still run all day."
1755,"August  9, 2015 12:48AM",dino001,"  The biggest issue I see is production cycle and spare parts. While it may be cheaper to retool than it used to be, it is still expensive. Moreover, by law of many countries the manufacturers have to keep spare parts of their models for many years, I think it is ten or so. Increase number of variations and shorten the lifespan and the cost goes up, perhaps disproportionately."
1756,"August 10, 2015  4:26AM",nyccarguy,"Overall I'm not a huge fan of the current body style C-Class.  The baby S Class styling is too much.  I don't like the current S class styling either.  However, I've always got my eye open.  On my way to the beach this afternoon I saw a gorgeous black/black C300 4Matic Sport sedan.  It had the lip spoiler on the back, the sporty looking 5 spoke wheels, the led lighting package.  Very sharp looking.  So I just built one online.  Given that I'm a man of adding few options these days, I just opted for what I thought I needed to make the C300 my own.  $47K & change sticker price.  I'm sure the 241 horsepower turbo 4 would be plenty motivation for my purposes, given the fact that my daily driver pumps out a whopping 175 horsepower.  I exited my C300 4 Matic Sport sedan build and started a new build.  Only this time I built a C400 Sport 4Matic sedan.  For about an extra $3500 with the same options, you get a 329 horsepower BiTurbo V6.  I like the sound of that."
1757,"August 10, 2015  7:55AM",flightnurse," What options did you do?  The MB Tex is of high quality and the contrasting stitching make it look very upscale, BMW could learn a thing about that.  I think MB did a good job with the new C class, I haven't driven one yet, but will in the next year."
1758,"August 10, 2015 12:39PM",dino001,"MB Tex may be looking upscale, but it ain't. A friend of mine has an older C-class and it positively does not breath, giving you hot and sweaty feel in summer days, which is half of the time in Florida. Combine it with absolutely ridiculous price MB charges for the leather seats and any other significant option and very low in-stock availability (for that reason) and I have no interest in anything Benz. I once entered building C-class, but existed at around 55 grand for C300 (didn't even finish just yet) and 60+ grand for C400. No, thank you. Compared with those, 3-series is a picture of bargain-priced value (it really isn't, but in comparison to MB everything looks like one).  Sure, C-class looks better inside, but almost nobody buys 3-series for their interiors (if anything, those have always been deterrent rather lure). C-class is bigger, but that's not necessarily a good thing in ELLPS - those are not bough per pound or cubic foot.  It's a fine vehicle, if you like that sort of thing, but it is priced just silly. If you break down pricing to the car and the logo on the hood, it seems to me they charge for the star about double or triple of what BMW does (and admittedly BMW charges double or triple of what Acura does). In other words, the star on the hood costs literally thousands of dollars. I wonder how much dealers sell it for as a spare part  MB sometimes gives to dealers very substantial cash incentives once the novelty wears off and they are pretty good in hiding them from the public, so the brand stays protected, but even with that I'm not interested."
1759,"August 10, 2015  2:00PM",graphicguy,"Dino, I've been on a couple of test drives in the new C Class. Pretty impressive, IMHO. Certainly the interior is the best of the class bunch. I do agree about the MBTex vs Leather. Some say you can't tell the difference. I certainly can, and it's not even close. That being the case, the real leather of the one I drove with the sport seats was of high quality.  I do think that the Turbo V6 is a bit of overkill in the car, but it does compare favorably to a 335i or S4. Perhaps that's because the turbo 4 is so smooth and responsive in the C300. The C400 I drove came in at the mid $50s. The C300 in the low $50s. Pricewise, I don't think the Mercedes is disadvantaged at all against the 3 Series or A/S Audis similarly equipped.  The dealer that I talked to said he'd take 10% off MSRP off any C he had in stock. That was a couple of months ago. So, not sure if it's still the case, but that makes a very, very nice C Class price extremely competitive.  NYC...one of the ones I test drove was a metallic grey C300 sport with the lip spoiler and front chin spoiler. It had red leather sport seats and the open pore wood accoutrements....very sharp. It came in at the high $40s. Dealer said the same as you....about $3,500 more for the same car with the V6 bi-turbo. Personally, I'd save the $3,500 and stick with the 4 pot....and that's saying something about how good the turbo 4 is. In all frankness, I am growing to love all these Turbo 4s these days, regardless of manufacturer. They're really torquey and provide excellent MPG."
1760,"August 10, 2015  2:20PM",robr2,I'm too am not a big fan of the S Class shrinky dink styling.  The local purveyor of MB's has over (20) 2013 C300 4 Matic all in the 13-17K mile range for about $32K. Not bad for a CPO unit IMHO.  And yes they all have MB Tex.
1761,"August 10, 2015  2:30PM",tlong,"I also don't like the looks of the new C class. I've actually thought about getting a couple year old C-class at a deal rather than the new ""ugly"" one new."

1763,"August 10, 2015  2:57PM",dino001," I think you're right. Perhaps something changed, or I checked something too much. It is low 50s, indeed, which is similar to a loaded 328. BMW has galloped their prices recently well beyond what it used to be. I remember being absolutely shocked first time I optioned one to a comparable equipment with my E91 wagon. It was something like five grand more on the sticker and still couple of things missing. Admittedly, mine was last year of production, with several options thrown in gratis, or well discounted, but still, the difference was enormous. So I may stand corrected on this. It is annoying though, when local Benz dealer in my area have absolutely no faith in their customers' real wealth, if all they order is MB Tex on C-class (also GLA, CLA). Even E-class comes with MB Tex standard and large percentage of units on dealers' lots have it, which I find absolutely ridiculous. It apparently works. I wonder if that's something people don't realize until it's too late, or something people know, but don't care."
1764,"August 10, 2015  3:00PM",dino001,"I read once that BMW's styling is based on 3-series and it is ""blow-up"" to their bigger models, including X-series (except of course their smallest models), whereas MB is shrink-down from the S-class. Apparently, the former works better, as it is easier to scale the aesthetics up than down."
1765,"August 10, 2015  3:50PM",breld,"The purchase of the S3 for my wife a couple weeks ago may have accelerated my plans for the Mazda3 being a fun ""in-between"" car.  Test drove several S4s this past weekend (couple used ones and a couple new ones, manual and automatic).  Also looked at a 328d wagon and a 428i gran coupe (x drive).  Wife and I both have historically been very pro-BMW. But ours have almost all been more ""enthusiast-oriented"" (wife had a wagon much like dino's (m-sport manual)), and neither of us are getting too excited about the current models. The 328d wagon I drove felt somewhat ordinary. To be fair, it wasn't as equipped as we would like, but nevertheless it had a sticker of $55k.  The 428i I really enjoyed and do love the body style for its looks and functionality. The one I drove was a sport-line and pretty well equipped for the low $50k's. If I really checked the boxes for all the options I would like, it gets to the high $50k's pretty quickly.  So having said all that, I'm probably leaning more toward an S4. It's actually quite the value in comparison to some of the other cars I looked at. I think they've done a good job updating the tech in the car to keep it up to date in that way for such an outgoing model. I find it endearing that a car that's been around for so many years is still holding its own against the competition (and then some). And, it's nice Audi still offers the choice of the manual and auto.  If I can hold out for awhile, I may still wait to see the new model."

1773,"August  4, 2015  9:10PM",andres3," I whole heartedly agree. Anyone who has ever had a car where reliability and durability caused great and frequent concern will always be very concerned with reliability and durability.  For instance, you might only pay $37K for a Focus RS in the near future, but would reliability woes end up costing you more than you'd pay for a $50K German car in the long run? My math says it is possible; if you value your time."
1774,"August  4, 2015  9:11PM",andres3,"    The reason the leases are expensive is because you have a high inflated MSRP selling price joining the reality of how much they are actually worth at the end of the lease. Someone has to pay for that, in the past it has been tax payers, but most think another bailout won't be granted, so you can't rely on that anymore."
1775,"August  4, 2015  9:17PM",dino001," I wouldn't be so sure that Audi, BMW, or Benz is much more reliable than Focus RS. It might, but it might not."
1776,"August  4, 2015  9:21PM",andres3," I think a big mistake was made keeping the Cadillac/GM names/brands around. They should have renamed and re-badged everything to try and get a cleaner slate from previously burned buyers. They should have followed the example set by GMAC, which became ALLY and they didn't exactly advertise the fact. Change your name, don't use any letters from your previous name (OK; Ally uses the A in GMAC; vowels will be forgiven). So think up a name that doesn't have the letters ""GM"" or ""Cdllc"" in it!"
1777,"August  4, 2015  9:28PM",andres3," I agree, if Ford is smart, they'll ensure the Focus RS is reliable and durable. If they don't give a damn, well, anything is possible. I guess my main point is I'd be worried (and I think others out there too) about the reliability and support of a nearly $40K Ford whereas with Audi they've already gained my trust, and others probably feel the same way given Audi's recent growth. I'd probably be worried about it with Benz too, a bit less so with BMW. Part of the reason is BMW offers free maintenance for a long time. The other part is I see a lot of BMW's at HPDE sessions/events and they don't seem to require tow trucks or early retirements during the weekend."

Led by sharp improvements in MKC and MKX sales, SUV numbers were up 39.3% to 6,350.  Cadillac’s drop came despite its management’s forecast that the brand is in the midst of a turnaround. Cadillac sales fell 7.1% in July to 14,154 compared to July of 2014. The numbers would have been far worse if the performance of its SRX crossover were not so strong. Its sales grew by 46.8% to 6,753. The SRX was Cadillac’s top-selling vehicle. Numbers for its cars were abysmal. ATS sales fell 38.5% to 1,588. Sales of its CTS dropped 27.5% to 1,515. Sales of the XTS dropped 32.9% to 1,302. Cadillac management has run out of excuses.  Even with a slowdown in Mercedes and BMW sales, raw numbers show the U.S. luxury brands still lag well behind.

If we start going back those 55 months, I believe we would come to a period where De Nysschen was at the healm -- the fact that things kept humming along after his departure is, I think, NOT an indication that the top guy doesn't matter, but rather an indication of how the products are perceived by the market.  As I dust off my graduate school marketing textbook (which is probably, by now woefully out of date), all evidence suggests EITHER to raise prices or increase market share by some method that leaves the perception of ""big bucks"" undamaged.  My leasing guru says: sub-vent the leases like there's no tomorrow, get the current product out and seen by the market; meanwhile work behind the scenes on getting products to the market that people WANT (translation Audi Q3, Q5 and Q7 rivals and BMW X1, X3, X4, X5 and X6 rivals).  If you ax me, the money spent bringing the all electric Caddy to market was a nice idea, but I don't see it as helpful to what ought to be the bread and butter ATS.  Isn't it true that for Audi THE meat and potatoes car is the A4 as the 3 series is for BMW? Shouldn't Cadillac at least consider doing whatever it takes to get ""a lot more"" ATS's in the hands of customers by almost any method (sub-vented leases being a good tool, typically)?  Or is it that the cars themselves just aren't ""gettin' it done?"" So no matter what you do within reason, some people will still say ""The Emperor Has no Clothes.""  One last random thought, the Audi dealer I shop is owned by a group that also owns a Cadillac dealership a couple blocks away -- so naturally, we do tend to browse that dealership since they know my wife and me as long time loyal ""dealer group"" customers. I have priced cars at the dealership and they are as stubborn as can be about the price they will use to run the numbers, whereas the Audi group seems willing to put the best deal on the table first. The experience at the Audi dealership is what I call horizontal sales, due to the fact that the sales staff is so laid back you have to wake them to get them to sell you the car; the Cadillac dealership still seems to employ a technique from yesteryear, with salesreps dressed in clothes one size too small and largely lacking in product knowledge beyond what they can glean just by looking at the sticker.  The approach at the Cadillac dealership is, well, disappointing, even as the cars are getting somewhat more interesting and competitive.

Most recently, he was scored by several dealers in New York who want him to make Cadillacs cheaper by offering more affordable leases and rebates.  If you ask de Nysschen, the main thing is to “do what’s right for the brand,” and doing what’s right doesn’t include cheapening a premium brand. But is it still the right thing to do when Cadillac sales are down 1.5 percent for the first half of 2015, while the luxury space continues to surge in popularity? Consider that Caddy’s international rivals – Audi, BMW, Lexus, and Mercedes-Benz – all enjoyed 7 percent growth or better in the same period. Once again, Cadillac is the outlier in its class, and de Nysschen may need to do more. For one, Cadillac has just one crossover despite the popularity of the class, and both the CTS sedan and ATS coupe are suffering in the sales race.  One tool Cadillac can use to turn things around, dealers contend, is to offer cheaper leases for its vehicles. In a Bloomberg special report, Potamkin Cadillac (Manhattan) general manager John Bruno related that the CTS once cost under $400 per month to lease. But now, leases are worth over $500 a month, or over 20 percent more expensive, and more expensive than what one would pay to lease a comparable BMW...."""
1817,"August  4, 2015 12:56PM",Michaell, ELR ... a rare sighting.
1818,"August  4, 2015  3:12PM",dino001," Nearly negative 40 percent is a disaster, considering that ATS didn't even reach its midcycle upgrade and their initial stated goals for the volumes. ATS was supposed to capture the fallout of CTS sticker shock, but it seems it did no such thing - people simply walked away completely, they didn't get CTS and they didn't get ATS, either.  I wonder if that's just Cadillac's hubris, or a real strategy. For years good old GM was losing money on every car they sold and ""making up in volume"" , but that ""strategy"" was a road to bankruptcy. Perhaps they decided to simply acknowledge they can't sell as many cars as before, but through product improvement, they can reach some sustainable level of sales, albeit lower than before. One possibility is, if they are truly capable of having superior product and financially ready to back up lower volumes, they may attempt to hop over Germans, who are going in an opposite direction, by making their brand more accessible. How difficult is that? Extremely. Even if they can make a product that beats the Germans, the logistical problems are multifold - their dealer network is too big for the lower volumes of ""exlusive brand"", they would have to let go many (which costs money in broken contracts), they will need to shutter or repurpose plants (which costs money) and the risk is the downward spiral may still continue (people see sales falling so they don't wont to join the ""losers"" club). The previous GM had completely gutless management and militant unions, which made any real downsizing impossible. Not sure if the current one can pull it off - perhaps they can. The road to brand rebuild is long and twisted.  Cadillac has been a ""volume premium"" brand for many decades now. It was ""super rich"" brand only at its inception. By the time around 50s -60s it was a car not just for a millionaire, but also for the local dentist and lawyer. It meant higher prices than popular cars, but low enough so every midsize town could have a Cadillac dealership. It's not like Jaguar, where they always were a niche player with small network, except failed rebadge Ford Mondeo experiment. Today they seem content with small market segment with very expensive product. Cadillac is simply too big for that. They need volumes. I think it's basically a failure from the sales point of view, even if the products (CTS and ATS) are best they have ever been."
1819,"August  4, 2015  3:18PM",dino001," In luxury goods segment, the customization of the taste allows for big premium. It's actually part of the appeal - to have something others don't. Others may have something similar, but not the same. This is me - the color, the exterior, the interior, or these options. BMW used to boast that you could have something like 2 million combinations in their 3-series, just in the US market, this was before splitting off 4-series (I can't even imagine, how many you could have in Europe, when you have three times as many engines).  Some people are willing to pay for being different. X5/X6, A6/A7, BMW's GT or GC lines are all catering to those people. It's probably expensive to make those short lines of different bodies, so you have to pay to get them. I consider those ""butique"" lines an equivalent of special leather, Bang and Oluffsen audio, or other high premium options. Some people won't see a value in that (for you it's ""the same"" car), others will tell you that look is worth 10 grand. Just like some people would say that premium leather or audio system are marginal for them and they won't pay 5 grand for those (they may be nice, just not five grand nice)."

I was truly disappointed when Kudlow didn't follow up with ""And whose fault was that?"". GM was still paying a dividend, big bonuses, spending money left and right. They should have stopped the dividend, start hoarding money well in advance of a planned contract renewal to the point that they could outlast the Union - just like literally everybody else in the machinery business did in 80s and 90s. Some actually went bankrupt (Cummins), others went into long strike (Caterpillar), until they broke the power of their union. But that would have been uncomfortable. Perhaps even bonuses wouldn't be paid, as self-set artificial sales goals wouldn't have been met, the stock would have been down for a while.

1823,"August  4, 2015  5:11PM",markcincinnati,"Cadillac's push to raise the price of the CTS to -- I assume -- 5-series territory is not based on a bad theory, it is just that it was [obviously] too early. A CTS at a 3-series price probably could have/should have continued for a bit longer. Those wanting a CTS/5-series sized car were, I think, heading to Cadillac for ""premium+value"" -- isn't this what Lexus did from day-one?  Now, a buyer with a 3-series budget goes into the Cadillac showroom, thinking he/she might drive out with a CTS and gets a bit of a shock upon seeing the MSRP of the CTS. I imagine the buyer isn't interested in an ATS after his plans to drive off in an American 5-series for a 3-series price have been dashed.  I would also imagine the unintended consequences of the CTS being priced at 5-series levels would be the buyer just goes ahead and gets a 3-series or perhaps finds a ""Summer of Audi"" lease deal that is too good to pass up.  I think the CTS, at the same price as a 5-series, is, today, too much wishful thinking on the part of De Nysschen and his marketing team.  The market isn't ready, yet, to accept a CTS priced like a 5-series.  Pity.  And, whoever wrote about my purchasing proclivities is dead-on: While I would not pay nearly $10,000 more for an A7 when I could have an identically equipped A6 for less, I would gladly pony up the $10,000 for optional extras like leather, electronics, wheels/tires and other factory-exclusive customization. Of course, I'd probably wrap it in a pure white colored car, since I also have an issue paying $1,075 for some off-beat blue color option, but would pay for B&O speakers in a heartbeat.

Those corporate echo chambers are just like cable news shows - everybody nodding and reinforcing each other how smart they all are (which is obvious, as they all agree).

Cadillac has what, an Escalade?  Were I in charge, I think I would -- for a while -- go for the ""land-grab"" approach to market share. I am certain that is exactly what Lexus did when they came out with a car that lured Mercedes shoppers into the showroom and had these shoppers test drive a Lexus that essentially did everything a Mercedes did but for some 20% less money. Today, I believe the big Merc and the big Lexus cars sell for similar sums and it is accepted.  My friend always bought 7-series, for a long long long time; eventually he bought an LS400 (or whatever the 7-series sized car from Lexus was/is), bought another one after that, too. I ran into him taking delivery of an Audi A8L recently. My how times have changed.

Fair enough. My gut feeling is that former M5 owners might love this CTS-V if they gave it a true test, but I understand that what drives one person to purchase a six-figure (or nearly) German performance sedan might not be sated with a domestic badge. But the Cadillac certainly makes a strong case for itself when spec sheets are measured.  Take the previously cited competitive set from Audi, BMW, and Mercedes for example: The CTS-V has a clear power advantage over all of them. The M5 gives up 80 hp and 130 lb-ft, the RS 7 80 hp and 113 lb-ft, and the E63 by an appropriate 63 hp and 40 lb-ft. The Cadillac is the lightest of the bunch, undercutting by anywhere from 130 to 330 pounds, and only the all-wheel-drive Mercedes is quicker to 60, by two tenths of a second. But you'll have to pay out of the nose to get those tenths: the E-Class is about $17,000 more expensive, base to base.

The city itself has a population of under 400K. Technically, then, most of us don't live in the city. I earn my living, however in the corp limit, as does my wife.  I drive to work -- or at least I used to -- on two interstates: I-275 and I-71. I have tried driving on these interstates at the early and late ""normal"" times, and find myself often putt putting along at whatever speed the car can manage ""at idle."" In winter, it is even worse.  I have now taken to driving on secondary roads and residential streets -- just to be able to get to 35MPH - 50MPH.  I am, currently, driving an Audi S4 -- a car that in the blink of an eye can almost reach triple digit speeds and the thing feels like it is on rails, making it a great hi-way cruiser, capable of an easy-peasy drive from Cincinnati to Columbus at speeds north of 80MPH.  I have not driven an RS7, I have driven a 2015 S6, however, and even that was somewhat frustrating since it is capable of feats of fancy that are virtually impossible on the roads I drive to go about my business.  I used to think if I had ""Trump Money"", I would certainly go for a super-car or at least an ""entry-level super car."" Not any more.  I really enjoy my S4 -- the few times I've been able to really push it, I have been impressed with its ""performance envelope."" I suspect I would find going back to a 2.0T equipped A4 a let down. But, I also suspect I would find moving forward with an RS4 (if a sedan version were to be made available in the US) would be a let down, too -- or at least immensely frustrating.  An unlimited bank account would allow me to acquire, for instance, an RS7 or whatever else might pass these days as a super sedan (an M5, too, would qualify). But what advantage would I have -- I rarely can use the full accelerative force my pedestrian S4 provides. Were I to attempt to ""punch it"" I would, more often than not, find myself overtaking and potentially ramming (""rig for ramming speed"") the pokey car in front of me.  Cutting yet another second+ off of my ability to accelerate would be -- in theory -- fun and potentially a safety feature (if you say it real fast and squint, 0-62MPH in 3.7 seconds could be a safety feature, couldn't it?) But, uh, REALLY? I think it is safe to say it is so highly unlikely I could ever use that much quickness, it would just be very, very frustrating. Heck, it is already frustrating with the ""urge"" my lowly S4 musters.  So, I have reached a point where I lust for the kind of performance that is available and, currently, unaffordable -- but I also balance that lust with the reality that it is not virtually impossible to use such power, it is literally impossible to do so.  So, I ask myself, why bother -- traffic is not getting any better, speeds are not getting any higher, abilities to actually use such accelerative force are waning as each day passes.  I'm just about ready to use public transportation -- oh wait, we don't have much of that here in River City, so I have to putt putt along in my ""entry level super sedan"" (well sort of), wondering what it would be like to, as my buddy says, ""punch it.""

I'm not so much lamenting the continuous move up in power as I am the continuous creep of traffic congestion and the resulting slow down of movement.

And, I'm living in about as much ""middle of nowhere"" as I would want to tolerate.  Having been to Germany many times, I am impressed how it is still possible to have a high speed autobahn and fairly high speed train transportation even around the major cities.

1861,"July 22, 2015 11:23PM",dino001,"The trick was in the tax structure, favoring diesels. That tax structure was justified by a doctored science, making the diesel engine look like a savior of the environment (vs. evil gasoline engine) due to lower carbon emissions, with nitrogen and particulate data using emission tests that were set up to produce appearance of much lower emissions than real life. As a result, the measured nitrogen oxide and particulate levels in cities did not go down and they tracked it to the emission test overstating the reduction of those emissions. In essence, if new diesel emission standards were followed using real life tests (similar to those in the US), there would be materially fewer engines certified in the marketplace (just like in the US), and those approved would be much more expensive. Hence the ""con"". There are some other interesting particulars in diesel market in Europe - like particulate filters that are often cut out by rogue drivers, because their replacement is horribly expensive, which defeats the purpose of the filter (this is more Eastern Europe phenomenon than Western). Also, it has been well documented that durability of those new breeds of diesel engines is well below what it was before and the maintenance is horribly expensive. Premature failures of double mass wheels, emission systems (especially in situations of frequent short trips, when particulate filters don't have a chance to burn out), increased sensitivity to fuel quality, make those engines equally or even more fragile than gas engines. The old stinker could go for million miles on vegetable or heating oil, the new quiet, ""clean"" diesel, has a lifespan similar or sometimes shorter than the gas engine with higher costs of overhauls. The prices of diesel repairs of those new TDI engines at authorized garages are legendary over there (it's not unique to VAG, same happens to MB, BMW, Peugeot, or Renault).  European Commission is trying to rectify the emission situation by tightening the standards to resemble American, but the issue is of course transition time. I believe once new enforcement is in place and costs of engines go up, the proportions of diesel engines in small cars will revert to values similar to those prior the whole craze, which is more than in the US, but much less than today. The move is already happening, primarily due to equalized diesel fuel prices (that used to be much cheaper), observed increased maintenance cost and lower durability (majority of Europeans, even in the West buy cars for eight-ten years, not three or five), but tightening the standard will likely accelerate it.  Americans never caught that bug, partially due to unrelenting of the US government on nitrogen oxide emission requirements. From what I understand it was also California that was even more ""anti-diesel"" than the feds.

1886,"July 28, 2015  6:22PM",markcincinnati,"Wonder what the % of manual transmissions delivered to customers is (and if there is any historical comparison available, what that might be)?  My wife and I purchased cars with manual transmissions up until 2005 when -- the cars that we wanted -- basically stopped being offered with manuals.  I did, mostly, enjoy my first 6-speed auto (a Tiptronic), but always wondered what the same car would be like with a manual. No way to tell, as a practical matter, anymore.  Then, I test drove the 2014 S4 with a manual and the 7-speed DSG (dual clutch ""automatic manual"") -- I found the DSG to provide all of the good things (except the actual depressing of the pedal) of a manual, but after a back to back demo drive (of both transmissions in otherwise identical S4's) I decided the DSG actually felt quicker, and it certainly could be a hell of a lot smoother. Moreover, I use the type of car washes where you give your car to ""the guy"" to drive through the tunnel, etc -- and I smelled a burning clutch and heard grinding gears one time too many, so I talked myself into the DSG.  Now at some 30,000+ miles later, I find the DSG to be the best transmission experience I have ever had, relegating my love of manuals to be my sentimental favorite, but not for the performance, I used to believe could only be achieved by rowing your own.  I am fortunate to also have another Audi an SQ5 with an 8-speed Tiptronic. Oddly, despite the torque converter, this iteration of the 8-speed is also better even than an S4's manual (there is no way to back to back test the SQ5 manual vs Tip since Audi only offers the SQ5 with the 8-speed.) But the 8-speed still has a hint, a vague suggestion really of being ""almost instantaneous"" making it sort of like the Coke Zero of Cola -- it's not Diet Coke, but it's not quite the real thing either.  The march forward of auto trans technology is, I would assume, largely responsible for the death and dearth of manual offerings. And, even though the DSG easily justifies its existence, I wonder if all 8-speeds are as good as the tuned version in the SQ5. I would, therefore, imagine there are other reasons for the paucity of stick shifts -- the only one I can think of is convenience, unless the real reason is ""we've"" been marketed to, so convincingly, and been convinced that we've lost the manual dexterity to undertake shifting, and that we don't really need it.  I'm going to stick with convenience as the killer of the manual.  But, I would be keenly interested in knowing the percentages if such source for that data is available.  Thanks."

1888,"July 28, 2015  8:13PM",cdnpinhead,"The alphabet-soup transmissions are probably wonderful, so long as they work and/or are under warranty.  When they break (and they do), then it's time to find out if the technicians at the dealership even know how to spell transmission. Most of them are told to remove and replace the whole assembly. If it's under warranty, then it's ""only"" a couple of visits to the d'ship and some amount of time in a loaner. If it's not. . .  Mark is a well-known proponent of never driving anything out of warranty. I've driven most of my vehicles way, way beyond the warranty coverage. We differ.  I like manuals. For simplicity and maintainability reasons, I seek out vehicles with them. My drive to and from work every day, and the trip up to the cabin and back, make use of (at most) 20% of the capability of the vehicle I drive. I just need the vehicle to need minimal attention. Back when I drove among Vancouver, Edmonton, Calgary & Regina through the Canadian Rockies in the middle of the night, having a vehicle that demonstrated excellent handling was important. Now it is not; the latest and greatest technology is for those who love bells and whistles. Actual driving rarely enters the discussion The Fraser Canyon at 2 am was a wonderful thing.

Like the passion for the oldie but sit in a new a3 and you would be hard pressed to distinguish it from current a6 from the cabin. The americAns might be onto something ."
1891,"July  3, 2015  3:31AM",andres3," I have to disagree. The new A3 left me feeling it wasn't a ""no corner cut"" Audi. I liked the lightweight chassis and tossable feel of the handling though. The old A3 was light enough to be tossable as well and was excellent with the DSG transmission which had great tuning in '06 (maybe not the tuning a Toyota driver looking for a smooth auto would look for). Also, it was a sport package equipped A3 I had (sport leather seats, aluminum air vent rings, aluminum shift paddles, 10 mm lower ride height, stiffer springs, stiffer dampers; fog lights, spoiler on the roof, awesomely tuned for sporty driving).  It had little details with seemingly (at the time) no corners cut. Things like aluminum sills front and back, a power port in the cargo area, lighting for all areas of the interior, and the DSG learned ""your style of driving."" By the way I don't own the A3 because I sold it at about 8 years old with 106,000 miles on the odometer ($8K).  The new A3 is smoother, quieter, but not as raw and involving. The transmission is tuned to pretend to be a regular run of the mill automatic unless you put it in S. It would be interesting to look at them side by side at the same time for comparison."
1892,"July  3, 2015  3:12PM",markcincinnati,"Jurassic Audi?  I am happy that Audi brought the A3 to market -- my assumption is this model will bring more customers into the fold. Everytime I visit my dealership, I make certain I get in whatever A3's are on the showroom floor. I must say, I think a base A3 without any options, seems out of place next to the RS7, S8, A6 TDI, and Q5's (and sometimes even an RS8) on the showroom floor, however. The higher contented (with sexier wheels) A3's just like the high zoot Q3's have no problem being a member of the family, however.  I have twice driven an S3, and I found them to be quick, powerful, almost visceral -- raw and rough around the edges. For $50K, plus $11 for the ear plugs that would be required, however, I would never buy one. Furthermore, firm is one thing, but the S3 in dynamic mode is harsh, more unrefined than any Audi I've ever driven -- until you get the thing above 90MPH, then it starts to make sense.  But, $50,000+ for an S3 -- which may not be too much considering the content and performance -- seems to put it out of the ""boy racer"" league, unless the ""boy"" has Trump as his last name.  The current S4 is showing its age, to be sure, but even though there is a new S4 looming in a matter of months, the current S4, for somewhat similar money, still seems far more refined and its supercharged V6 is sublime compared to the S3's sturm und drang.  The S3, to an older fart like me, reminds me of the first time my then boss let me drive his new Porsche 944 turbo. When I found out how much it cost, I just couldn't fathom why anyone would subject themselves to that much punishment just to be able to have a car that was supremely capable at triple-digit speeds (in an era when the maximum speed limit was 70MPH -- which we have, once again, returned to here in Ohio, thankfully.)  So, perhaps the A3 really is the refined ""little"" model deserving of the Audi rings; but, to me, as capable -- at speed and a caution to the wind driving demeanor -- as the S3 is, it seems almost more like something that should have been marketed by VW or had its roughest edges filed down and more sound deadening stuffed into every crack and crevice.  My remarks, it should be emphasized, pertain mostly to the S3, and entirely to the S3 when it comes to driving impressions. An upscale Premium+ or Prestige model A3 certainly seems to fit right into the family dynamic, and hopefully the driving experience does nothing but strengthen that perception.  The S3 is a fun car and one that from time-to-time could be a hoot -- a great romp, the Jurassic World Audi, perhaps."
1893,"July  7, 2015  8:03PM",andres3,"There is a VW S3, but it's called the Golf R and has 5 doors.

1894,"July  8, 2015  6:44PM",markcincinnati,"How's Them New Taars? ""Taars"" mid-west col·lo·qui·al for ""Tires""  Hopefully this is somewhat of a public service, since I have no financial interest whatsoever in Continental Tires or The Tire Rack or The Audi Connection, despite spending money with all three entities.  The new shoes -- Continental DWS 06's -- have been on my '14 S4 (18"") and on my wife's '14 SQ5 (20"") for over 300 miles (in my case over 400 miles); and, today, July 8th, is a day befitting a duck -- steady, steady rain. The puddles have puddles, in fact.  This is really the first day I have driven with the DWS 06's on seriously wet streets, roads and highways.  Up until today, my report would have been entirely based on dry-pavement experiences. And, to put a finer point on things, the report I would give would have been easily rendered: Excellent handling, turn-in and bump absorption while being both quiet and comfortable (the latter qualified with the phrase ""for an ultra-high performance tire."")  I was in a big hurry this morning for a 9:30 meeting which required streets, secondary roads and two interstates to get to. Of course, it rains -- which, in Cincinnati, at least, brings out a driving behavior reminding me of the phrase ""deer in the headlights."" You see, Cincinnati drivers appear to never have seen rain, sleet or snow -- EVERY SINGLE TIME it rains, sleets or snows. This leads to -- hmm, seemingly endless (and unexplainable) backups when the coefficient of friction drops (like today) perhaps not much more than 10-15%. Such is life.  With some trepidation, therefore, I decided, initially, that ""ACD"" (assured clear distance) calculations had to be modified to make certain I could stop rather than ram into the ""deer"" ahead of me as he/she somehow managed to lose control of their car due to some standing water.  No worries.  The ""W"" in DWS (Dry Wet Snow) came through like a champ. The car continued to behave ""about as normal"" -- a rain soaked highway seemed little changed compared to a dry version of the same road, at least as far as I could tell behind the wheel. I half expected some earlier onset under-steer (and I'm sure it would be there at some speed) than on a dry road, but -- with my hand held high in the ""I swear"" position -- I didn't detect any even on that one curve I forgot about as I winded my way toward I-71S.  Another testimonial -- of approximately the same conclusion -- came from my wife, who was a couple of miles ahead of me (as usual) in her SQ5 with the same new shoes as mine; she and I were ""open lined"" with our mobile phones and with our traffic info nav screens set to 2 miles. She remarked how unfazed the SQ was under the circumstances. And, if you recall, she had just come from 40,000 miles on the previous gen DWS (sans 06) tires. For her the improvement in the DWS 06's vs the DWS is noticeable but not ""night and day"" noticeable; for me, on the other hand, coming from H rated Continental Grand Touring's, the DWS 06's absolutely have transformed the car into what it should have been from mile one.  Two comments on that:  #1 My fault, my bad, for not fitting DWS's on upon delivery (like we did with my wife's)  #2 Audi's fault, Audi's bad, for selling an ""S"" car with all-season Grand Touring H-rated tires; anything less than the latest and greatest all-season ultra high performance tires raises the question ""what were they thinking?""  Just because an American customer wants all-season tires, does not mean, nor does it even suggest, that the customer expects anything less than the highest performance tires available at the time the car is screwed together at the factory.  Clearly (to me at least) many folks on the other side of the pond don't get some American driver's choice to wear one set of shoes on the car year 'round. When we buy a premium sport-performance sedan -- and request all-season tires -- no where is it written that the performance capabilities of the tires should drop from ultra-high or max performance all the way down to ""H"" rated family sedan fitments. Yet, today's UHP A/S tires are a compromise -- but time and technology have advanced to a point where a tire like Continental's DWS 06 UHP A/S can provide a performance envelope virtually equal to and in some cases greater than some Max Performance tires.  I would not argue that these tires are fungible with any Extreme Performance or even most Max Performance tires -- but the DWS 06's give up virtually no ground to many other UHP summer-only tires and, as noted can sometimes match the performance of Max Perf models.  The moral, if there is one, of the story is if, like me, you don't want -- for several reasons, including ""wheel wear from tire swapping"" -- to change your tires back and forth between summer and winter tires AND you live in an area of ""moderate"" -- not heavy -- snow, these UHP All-Seasons are ""the best you can get"" [today] (until a better one comes along the day after tomorrow -- probably from Michelin).

Much of the US, however, has some cold without much white stuff, that is where I (speaking only for myself) would stick with the year 'round one-tire solution.  Come to think of it, were I to feel the need for a summer and a winter tire, I would almost certainly use dedicated wheel/tire combinations rather than have the wheels be ever so slightly damaged every time I changed the tires."
1909,"July 15, 2015  1:36AM",zandor,"I prefer two sets of tires and wheels even on AWD cars. AWD + winter tires = awesome. The other reason I like 2 sets is I like summer tires. If I get summer tires I need something else for winter, so I might as well do it right and get winter tires. Around here (Chicago) the snow isn't usually too bad, so I prefer performance winter tires unless it's a RWD car. They're much better on roads that aren't covered in snow than something like a T-rated snow and ice tire."

Until my wonderful '05 TL, I had done quite nicely with FWD/All Seasons, snow-driving experience and a modicum of common sense and luck. The TL was just not as confidence inspiring once the snow got more than a couple of inches deep, so I bought a set of Dunlop snow sneakers on dedicated rims. Night and day.  My AWD XF with the stock Contis was a champ in this past winter's several Snowmageddons/Snowpocalypses. However, if I lived in the mountains of Maine, NH or Vermont, likely I'd go snow shoes without giving it a second thought.

1912,"July 18, 2015  7:06PM",dino001,"This is not directly related to ELLPS, but many people here expressed their admiration, or at least interest in diesel-powered cars. I just read an article that essentially vindicates my diesel position. European Union is changing its stance on diesel emissions. Up to now, they were giving diesels essentially free pass, or forbearance on tested emission levels. Their current testing procedures measure unrealistically low levels emission (it is by setup) and those levels are used in certification process. Moreover, those unrealistic values look better than gasoline engines. This is similar to old EPA highway gas mileage, when those high numbers were obtained by running cars on a sunny day, with no wind, super even speed in an oval track, with a skinny driver behind the wheel, everything taken from the trunk, tire pressure set up at above normal levels, etc. Moreover, the carbon emission fetish (which was huge in Europe way before our administration caught the bug) lead to additional forbearance on nitrogen oxide, which is much more toxic to humans in immediate effect. Carbon is supposedly bad for the planet, so we have to prevent ourselves from being drowned in oceans, or suffering other horrible ""Inconvenient Truth"" death scenario due to temperatures raising by 2 degrees, but nitrogen oxide killing us before then was apparently OK. This whole setup was to made diesels look much better than they really were, and as such they were taxed at lower levels. All politics.  The regulators are looking now to made all emission testing realistic and using those values for certification process. The situations is reportedly so bad that, if implemented immediately, multiple models would have to be withdrawn from the market, which tells you how much skewed the setup was. Thankfully, United States government never bought into that diesel BS to the same degree. I also recall the difficulties with ""clean diesel"" implementation initiative (e.g. Navistar having to pay huge penalties on their engines because they couldn't make them compliant on time), I suspect part of that was that there was no forbearance on the testing.  I always maintained that Europeans bought diesels not by choice, but because they were made by artificial market setup. Also, American ""resistance"" to diesel was not as ""irrational"" as many people would try to make us believe. There is surely place for those engines - in agriculture, construction, heavy and midsize transportation, buses, perhaps on SUV-level. I think diesel Suburban, F-150, or even BMW X5 (or Honda Odyssey, if they made it) make perfect sense. If you have three kids and like taking long road trips, diesel would should advantages, My problem was with worshiping TDI Jettas and Passats. They may be fine, but I would still take a gasoline engine every day and twice on Sunday."
1913,"July 18, 2015 10:33PM",flightnurse," Dino, you can take your stand and use it any car. Do we really need a 120K MB S600? Doesn't a 60K Lexus LS460 give the same ride and comfort?

1914,"July 19, 2015 12:18AM",dino001,"That's true, to each their own. My point is that many that say they want to see more diesels, because Europeans have them, so it must be so great, but it turns out those Europeans were convinced and coerced by their governments using tax incentives, penalties, and other means as diesels were supposed to be so great for the environment. Turns out, it was a giant con, based on phoney metrics, made to fit a story. The tide turned, it will take some years to change, but it seems diesels ain't so great when things are made equal. Once the goverments remove those preferences and even the field, you'll see European market move back toward having much more gasoline-leaning market, where diesels will have their place, but the siliness of pusing them into every model will likely stop. It will never be as barren as here, but it likely resemble what was there twenty years ago or so, when those new diesel everywhere hoopla started."

1918,"July 22, 2015  5:27PM",markcincinnati,"Regarding Diesels:  dino001, are there issues/circumstances that argue against diesels? I thought, here in the US, that once the fuel was cleaner and with the advent of ""ad-blue"" that the only factor arguing against diesel being widely adopted was inertia.  The message that I have bought into is that diesels -- and this means the hardware and the fuel -- produce more torque and can often achieve some 1/3 better mileage than gasoline (around here premium and diesel are often close to each other in price.) In short, I have bought into the notion that diesels can actually be fuel sipping ""hot rods."" The SQ5 which is a terrific performer, is actually offered as a diesel in Germany, for instance.  When my S4's tank is full the ""miles to empty"" reading is 400. I assumed this would mean it would be at least 520 to empty if I had the diesel set up that is in the German market SQ5 in my S4. Based on the AudiUSA website (which, for example offers up a 3.0T A6 and a diesel A6) I assumed it would be a pretty simple calculation to estimate the asking price for an S4d (if one were to be made for the US market) and to then determine how many tankfuls until break even, etc.  That ""perception"" which I somehow seem to be reading in your post, may be part true, part myth. Please elaborate -- here's why: I have been against using ""food"" to make ""gas"" since some politician, I assume, started pressing for e85 fuel; conversely, it has always seemed that diesel engines in our cars could be a good bridge to a future where we actually can use less and less fossil fuel.  I read your post, however, and I wonder if I just drank some diesel flavored kool-aid some years ago.  Again, please elaborate on your point about Europeans being coerced and apparently tricked into adopting diesels whilst we 'mericans adopted, almost universally, gasoline.  Thanks."

1927,"June 29, 2015  2:43PM",dino001," There is no 335d for F30 model in the US market. It was only E90 and IMHO that model was completely pointless (want a fast car, get 335).  I think C&D staff has unreasonable expectations, similar to those who buy a small coupe and then complain about rear seat being cramped, or getting a truck and then acting all surprised it doesn't handle like a sports car. It's a four-cylinder diesel that gets you 40 mpg. Nothing is free in this world. I drove 328 diesel, it was fine, exactly what you may want if you are a diesel buyer (I am not, but I think I can understand what people want when shop for one - it's not what 335d used to be).  The badge of course was a bit slight of hand - it's a Euro's 320d model rebadged for here as 328d. The reason is clear, as US buyers wouldn't pay upper market price (couple thousand premium over 328i) for a car with downmarket model designation (320). Badges matter here. It's also simple pricing difference overall (there same models being twice the price here, the differences between model designations do not translate into as significant pricing separation, in relative terms).  I'd like to see some statistics on that transfer case. If it's a real pattern, it's a big issue."
1928,"June 29, 2015  3:28PM",roadburner,"I should have known the 335d was gone, but after 32 years of BMW ownership and CCA participation my interest in the marque has decreased significantly; a couple of weeks ago I found last month's Roundel under a stack of car/motorcycle magazines- I hadn't even removed it from the poly bag."
1929,"June 29, 2015  4:34PM",robr2," Is that the case? I went to the UK site to see and they offer in the diesel 316, 318, 320, 325, 330, 335. No where could I find the actual engine size. Does BMW actually make 6 different diesels in those sizes?  I used the live chat at bmw.uk.co and their reply was the 316, 318, 320 all use the 2.0 engine and the 330, 335 use the 3.0. They are doing the same ""label = how it should perform"" as in the US."
1930,"June 29, 2015  4:42PM",dino001," To confirm it, you need to look up the UK specs of their 320d and see that the torque and hp numbers are exact match for 328d US version (I did it for German version).  Yes, the labeling has totally departed the engine size about 10 years ago, or so - even before then it was only loosely related (like 323/325 and 328/330 had same engine size, 3.0 liter). However, 328d is simply 320d from UK/Europe for marketing/pricing reasons. If you look at performance figures of 328d (US), they are significantly lower than 328i, more in line with 320i, which would fit as again, it really is 320d, rebadged."
1931,"June 29, 2015  5:02PM",flightnurse," The 335d was a test car for BMW, it was infact their first diesel car in the use in over 30 yrs, E38 524td, was a good car for the time, but was pricey. So fast forward to the E90 335d, was a rocket, 255hp and 413lbs of torque, it's basically the same engine in the 535d and X5 3.5d. The 3.5 liter was too big of engine for the E90, and I think the 2 liter is too small for the F30, BMW has a 2.5 liter 4 cyl oil burner which would give about 20 more HP and about 50 lbs more torque. It would still deliver in the high 40s on the open road. That would take care of the power problem."
1932,"June 29, 2015  5:04PM",flightnurse," I'll back Dino, our 328d is the euro 320d, same engine.. If they all use the same 2 liter, then it is all about tune.. Just like the our 320 and 328i."
1933,"June 29, 2015  5:34PM",dino001," That's right. However, there is a real difference between 320i and 328i in output, regardless of the engine size. Moreover, 320i/328i sold here are the same cars sold Europe with only differences due to market certification. However, US-market 328d was a pure badge gimmick. Europeans have always known diesels are more expensive to make, hence they have to be substantially more expensive to buy. Americans don't fully understand reasons for such a price premium in diesel-powered cars, so something ""badged"" as lower end (320d) would not sell at price that's even higher than mid-level 328i. Hence, 328d, not 320d as everywhere else in the world.  BTW, the European love of diesels is clearly weakening. Not that it's gone, but they are not seen as attractive as they used to be. Price of fuel went up so much vs. gasoline (unlike in the US, Europe had had cheaper diesel for decades prior last few years - that was due heavier taxation of gasoline, but now it got offset by higher market pricing due to heavy machinery and generator demand plus more stringent refining requirements), so higher diesel price was offset by better mileage PLUS cheaper fuel. Today, the latter is gone, only mileage is better, so it takes much longer to offset purchase price premium. Diesels are still kings in larger vehicles, like SUVs and crossovers (which are coincidentally getting more popular there), but in smaller and midsize sedans/hatchbacks are getting less and less attractive in diesel versions and the proportions of new car sales are slowly changing."

1938,"June 30, 2015  9:35PM",markcincinnati,"New Shoes  The '14 S4 I ordered came with the no-cost optional all-season tires. The tire specification was, on my part, deliberate since, living in Cincinnati -- the home of typically ""moderate"" winters -- I know I can't get away with ""summer only"" shoes year 'round. My previous A4 with the sport option came with 19"" wheels and summer only tires, which were great except for two things: 1 - they suck at any temperature below 40; and, 2 - the tread life of the Max Performance Summer Only tires that Audi chose was, optimistically not much north of 11,000 miles. This time, I thought I'd go with an S4 with the A/S's -- and I assumed since I was ordering an ""S"" car, the all-season tires would be the best of the best UHP A/S's on the market, probably Continentals or Michelins.  Bzzz! Thanks for playing, but the correct answer is that the tires on the car were ""H"" rated Grand Touring tires, albeit from Continental. The main characteristic of these GT tires was that they were very quiet. Otherwise they seemed out of place, somewhat, on an S4 -- the phrase ""under-tired"" springs to mind.  We had, prior to driving my wife's SQ5 off the lot had Continental DWS UHP tires put on the 20"" wheels, and these tires were (considering they were UHP A/S's) a true pleasure, the best of both worlds, if that is even possible.  So, here we are about 2 years later (my how time flies), she with 40,000+ miles on the SQ and me with 30,000+ miles on the S4 deciding that we had gotten what we wanted out of the tires on our respective S cars.  Meantime, back in the lab, Continental had updated the DWS tires and renamed them, slightly, DWS 06. Now, I have about 75+ miles on my new DWS 06 tires and the SQ gets its new shoes day after tomorrow.  For a 100% back-to-back commentary, we'll have to wait until we can drive in on DWS's and drive out on DWS 06's -- but my impressions of these tires on the S4 are from the context of driving in on Grand Touring slightly stiff sidewall tires and driving out on UHP very stiff sidewall tires (and, now that I've passed 50 miles, the slickness is gone).  The DWS 06's if you need (or want) all-seasons have transformed the responsiveness of the S4 from very good to ""I can't believe this is even the same car"" great. Additionally, these tires are even quieter than the outgoing GT's and even the ""jolts"" felt when hitting potholes are now, somehow, felt as if through some kind of energy absorbing compound (flubber perhaps?)  Here's the [current] bottom line:  These tires were designed to end ""your"" (and my) need to apologize for having all-season tires; there is quite a bit of explanation and detail that goes into what Continental did (or at least how their marketing department explains what they did) -- the sum and substance you can look up, but it all falls under the name ""Sport Plus"" technology.  SPT aims to provide drivers with much more precise handling (than any other UHP A/S tire on the market) and confidence and security on wet and/or slick surfaces, 35% stiffer sidewalls, and an even quieter ride than the DWS all with a 50,000 mile tread life warranty.  I'd say, thus far, their aim is true. These tires make me REALLY REALLY want to carve up the secondary roads I'm used to in my neck of the woods.  A set of four, for my S4 was $719.56 and was $908.96 for the SQ5 (S4: 245 x 40 x 18""; SQ5: 255 x 45 x 20"").  I had mine mounted and road-force balanced (plus a 4-wheel alignment) for $200, at the Audi dealer.  I plan to ""drive it like I live"" for at least another 40 - 45,000 miles.

1948,"July  2, 2015  9:20PM",markcincinnati,"Product Life Cycles: It's Time for a Change  The Germans -- and for all I know all of them -- produce new cars, not ""refreshes"", about once every eight years. My 2014 S4 is so very similar to my 2009 A4 (that I bought in third quarter 2008), it was difficult for me to actually see much difference, even though mine is a ""post refresh"" version.  Here is what this means: an A4 (and you can fill in the blank for your favorite make) available in calendar 2008 (in the US) is essentially repeated with continuous improvements in 2009, 2010, 2011,2012,2013,2014 and 2015, with a truly new car unavailable until calendar 2016.  Now, don't get me wrong, my 2014 S4 does have many seen and certainly many more unseen improvements over my 2009 A4. But progress, like time and tide, continues to advance -- and apparently the ""avionics"" are seldom unable to be upgraded, which leaves the last two and sometimes three years of a ""model run"" possibly out-dated.  It's no wonder the A4's sales (see post above) have dropped nearly 15% (and there have been decent incentives on this model, and it still manages to have a sharp sales drop off). The phrase often seen in the enthusiast's magazines is ""long in the tooth"" -- and that term is typically used after about 6 years after an all-new model is released.  Now, I'm not simply or just talking about the styling changes that typically go along with an all-new model, no, I'm talking about the wheelbase, width, platform, engine/transmission choices and technology advances, the features and functions (available inside the car) and even the audio systems and safety features.  Yet Audi, BMW and Mercedes seem hell-bent on this 8-year cycle as if they haven't yet noticed the last couple of years of a model's cycle see a big time sales decline. There is some historical justification for delaying the new model roll-out, and there is, no doubt, an economic reason for doing this -- at least there used to be.  Now, new technology -- which makes its way to cars faster and faster and more quickly than ever before -- becomes available about every 18-24 months, which should translate to cutting the 8-year cycle to 6 years, and, frankly, perhaps to 5 years.  Conversely, the rapidity of available [technology] change could argue for the automotive manufacturers to take a page out of aviation's play-book -- that is to allow us at least some reasonable ability to upgrade our car's ""electronic"" systems. Increasingly, our cars interface with ""us"" via software controlled devices. Furthermore, even when the new software requires upgraded hardware components, we should be able to swap out the old for the new.  I recently upgraded my relatively old laptop by swapping out a spinning disk-drive for a solid state drive and simultaneously was able to move from Windows 7 to Windows 8 -- and you don't need to get me started on the ability to keep upgrading the OS on my Apple devices; and upgrade my home theater from VHS to DVD to BluRay without having to buy an entirely new home theater system.  Airplane owners have long enjoyed the ability to, as I said, upgrade the avionics of their planes to conform to FAA requirements or to add additional functionality to their planes.  I understand the need to produce newly styled vehicles -- but I believe the life cycles have to drop from 8 to 6 to 4 or 5 years, especially if auto manufacturers remain unwilling to allow us to make some in-between model upgrades. Folks who want the newest styling will always want the newest styling would be my assumption.  Imagine if the new iPhone didn't come out for five years after the last one, or if we had to wait for UHD-TV because HD hadn't been out for at least 8-years, and so on.  Audi, BMW, Mercedes and all the manufacturers who have these impossibly long lag times between the introduction of new models need to get with the realities associated with the Law, Moore's Law, that is."
1949,"July  2, 2015  9:23PM",andres3," Wow, Audi is really kicking butt with the A3. Interesting how I found my '06 A3 superior in many ways to the current model, though Americans prefer their sedans to ""sportbacks"" as Audi put it. The sales numbers show that."
1950,"June 24, 2015  3:28AM",graphicguy,tlong...makes sense.  FN...message me and I'll give you the scoop if you want. Most here know it already.
1951,"June 24, 2015  5:13AM",andres3,"  The S4 is available with a 6-speed manual transmission complete with all 3 pedals on the floor! It also amazingly makes the car quite cheap, at under $50K even with extra pricey paint before negotiation. If you have to have all the gadgets and doodads then add $8K."
1952,"June 24, 2015  5:22AM",andres3,"  I agree with your assessment. In fact, I think the TL from 10 years ago is superior in some ways to the new TLX. Although, to be fair, the TLX is available with a V6 too, though they seem to be rare and overpriced.  10 years ago I was able to get a sport packaged equipped Audi A3 for about $30K out the door, nowadays, that wouldn't get me a loaded GTI.  Seems to me you might want to try the Golf R, reviews seem to say it is nice, refined, and should give that tight agile feel your looking for at under $40K, if you can find one. I didn't like the A3 for it's too small trunk, too plain interior, but I did like how light and toss-able the chassis felt."

1959,"June 24, 2015  4:57PM",benjaminh,"  One thing you've probably already thought of is that few brands beyond Acura are likely to give you the 10 or so years of very reliable service that you've had with your TL. If you'd gotten a MB, Audi, or BMW back in 2005, by now it's likely you would have run into some expensive stuff. And I'm not sure it's fair to compare the price of your TL ten years ago with the price of a TLX today. A loaded Audi A3 might suit you better, but it will costs c. $5000 or so more than a comparable TLX.  The TLX really does have some significant features beyond your TL. It's much safer, gets higher mpg, has 4 wheel steering, as well as a lot of other things just being dreamed of ten years ago.  I liked the handling of our Mazda5 too, but it failed the IIHS crash test. Since the Mazda5 essentially killed the dummy inside, we sold it.  Did you like the ILX?"

1966,"June 24, 2015  9:16PM",breld," Well, I don't know how much you want me to go into it.  I'm beyond the ""stepping up the food chain"" with my car purchases, and appreciate what different cars have to offer. On top of that, I change out of cars often enough that I'm only committed to a particular purchase as long as I am enjoying it, thus giving me the ""freedom"" to try different cars out.  When I say I am pleased with the change, it has nothing to do with directly comparing the BMW and the Mazda3 - perhaps that was misleading. For what type of car I was looking for, the Mazda really fit the bill well.  I was sort of in a large sedan mode with the 535i (xdrive), having also just come out of a Passat. But with a nice comfortable minivan as the family hauler, I had the freedom and yearning to return to something more on the compact, sportier side for my daily driver. I also was interested in a manual transmission. Such cars are becoming more and more scarce, and the Mazda 3 is a nice choice for those priorities (I also considered a WRX and Civic Si, but liked the overall balance of the Mazda. And my wife already has a GTI, or I probably would have gone that route). The Mazda is very engaging to drive, requiring driver involvement to best take advantage of its (relatively low by today's standards) 184 hp through the slick 6-speed manual.  I most frequently post on the CCBA forum, and those that participate there know me (and my habits) fairly well. Lest my current ride be taken as speaking out of place on this particular forum, I have indeed owned several ELLPS vehicles, mostly various 3-series. I've also owned three 5-series, one of each from the past three models (E39, E60 and F10). The F10, while superbly comfortable and sharp-looking, just didn't hit the same notes as my earlier BMWs - that wasn't surprising based on test drives; I knew full well what I was getting into. I just didn't realize how much I'd be longing for the increased driver involvement.  So, I went for the total contrast in the Mazda 3. Within a year or two, I suspect I'll land somewhere in the middle, having my eye on a 4-series GC once they start hitting the used market."

1968,"June 25, 2015  1:40AM",tlong," Andres, thanks for the suggestion. I don't think I'm inclined to spend that much for the S4 although I'm sure I would enjoy it. Also isn't the A4 due for a redesign in a year or so? I'm curious to see what changes. Unfortunately I'm sure it will go up in price some more."
1969,"June 25, 2015  1:44AM",tlong," Breld, thanks for the suggestion and I would be interested in your thoughts. Feel free to PM me if you don't want to post a lengthy story.  I'm sure after 10 years with my TL I would find some things lacking in a smaller car like the Mazda (I suspect noisier, tinnier, etc.). Of course my TL is tinnier than my A4 was. But boy it is nice to have high reliability and reasonable parts cost. I suppose we are all looking for that German feel with the reliability of the Asian makes. I'm sure for those who lease or keep a vehicle a short time it's not so important, but I'm a minimum 100K miles type of guy and so reliability is kind of important."
1970,"June 25, 2015  1:50AM",tlong," I sort of liked the ILX. It was nice and all but actually the car I really used to like was the original TSX, before they bloated it up. I had those as loaners a few times and liked the interior, size, and agility. The ILX is nice but the styling inside and out isn't motivating me. I'm sure they are good reliable cars which would be the plus, but I'm thinking not very sporty. Honda/Acura seems to have lost that sportiness that they had in the 80s and 90s."
1971,"June 25, 2015  1:55AM",tlong,"  Roadburner, who has been on these boards for, lo, these many years, did a similar thing.

I've been up the ladder to the '98 A4, bought new, sport package, 6 cyl 5 speed. I STILL miss that car - but out of warranty at like 60K I started having cooling issues and the dealer of course could not figure it out, to the tune of a few trips of $800-$1200 each. Intermittent on warm days, only when the car was under load like climbing hills, etc. So I got rid of it at 88K, which is the earliest I've ever gotten rid of a car.  I've also been up the ladder on the TL - 150K, very reliable, pretty luxurious, but kind of too big and a bit of a wallowy barge.  ""The ladder"" of course is many things to many people - it could be cost, acceleration, badge, handling, economy, reliability, any combination of those. Thank goodness we have so many choices. I wouldn't disparage anybody's choices or priorities and so I can completely understand why those who owned BMWs would want something less expensive, or frankly, more involving. In the old days BMW was the high end ""involving"" make and Honda was probably the low end ""involving"" make. Nowadays I'm not so sure it's BMW at the high end and it is certainly not Honda at the lower end any more. Which is why Mazda is appealing if you are trying to be economical but still get some involvement."
1972,"June 25, 2015  2:27AM",roadburner,"  I was initially looking at a GTI back in 2007, but the local VW dealers all proved to be hopelessly inept. I checked out everything from a Mustang Bullitt to an X5 4.8is to an E39 M5. I finally decided to go with a FWD car since we were seeing so many Civic Sis, GTIs, Minis, etc.at our HPDEs- I figured I should have some actual seat time in that drivetrain configuration if I was going to instruct those drivers. The Mazdaspeed 3had received extremely good reviews from Automobile, AW, CD and R&T and was reasonably quick so I figured, why not? Funny thing: at my first BMW CCA HPDE with the Mazdaspeed(dead stock, OEM tires) it was raining a bit during the first instructor session. I lapped every car on the track. Twice."
1973,"June 25, 2015  4:17PM",markcincinnati," The V6 SH AWD ""version"" is, if you axe me, not a version at all, it is an entirely different car. Whatever additional tuning is performed on the SH AWD ""version"" gives it transformed handling (reminds me of an S4) -- and it is not (or perhaps I should say it can't possibly be just because of) the torque vectoring rear differential.  Perhaps, in response to someone's question regarding why the Q50 isn't setting any sales records, I suggest driving back-to-back-to back the following: Acura TLX SH-AWD Advance, Infiniti Q50S AWD and the Lexus IS 350 F-sport AWD. Of the three, the Infiniti Q50S is the least impressive.  I used to say the BMW 3 was the German version of Infiniti's G37X -- somehow,they (Infiniti) lost their mojo with the new Q50S -- having said that, however, I have confidence they will find it again.  I liked the Lexus so much I ordered one, fully loaded, thinking even a Premium Plus S4 wasn't ""within reach"" -- but the magic discount offered due to my membership in the Audi Club of NA, plus some very impressive money factors, made the S4, as they say, within reach of us mere mortals."
1974,"June 25, 2015  5:03PM",graphicguy,"Mark...I concur with you. SH AWD, even in the TLX, is a ""horse of a different color"". While not the performance beast the S4 is, it's not far off the mark in many repsects.  I vascilate on the IS 350 F Sport. On the one hand, it's a fun drive. Not a ""bahn burner"" by any stretch, but peppy, with divine steering. Love the seats, too.  On the other hand, it's cramped. Certain features are just confounding. Overall, for high $40s all oaded up (and low-mid $40s discounted), you could do a lot worse. That puts it in the price ballpark of the TLX SH AWD ADVANCE. That's a tougher decision when you factor that into everything.  That C CLass and the interrior, and the ""smoothness"" of how it drives and operates, while giving up little in the way of ultimate performance can be had in the mid $40s range, too (loaded up and discounted).  Now, all of a sudden, I ask myself ""is a 335i worth $10K more?"" No immediate answer comes to mind because I'd have to ponder that one long and hard.  No disrrespect meant for those who like the Q50. But, my opinion only, it gets left by the side of the road amongst these others mentioned above. Even the Q50S feels crude by comparison."
1975,"June 25, 2015  8:06PM",markcincinnati,"One of the things about the Q50 that I noticed -- having come from an FX with the same motor -- is a certain, er, ""coarseness"" (the pros call it thrashing) that the other Japanese and Germans lack. Now, having said that, the 3.7L motor in the Q50 seems to have been given a extra shot of sound deadening, but at full-cry the engine, which is still good, just shows its more unrefined side.  The Lexus, especially compared with the Acura, was a bit cramped inside; but after having had a TL, everything seems a bit tighter, and I would quickly forget the relative girth of the Acura. Yet, the Lexus had a nicer interior than the BMW 3 -- of that I am certain.  I am finding out that I am not a fan of the north and south display screens (e.g., in the Q50 and Acura), it makes the interior look a bit chopped up.  To each his/her own on that count, though. I hate the pop up nav screen that is all the rage these days -- looks so much like something from the aftermarket (Pioneer in-dash head units come to mind)."
1976,"June 26, 2015 12:52AM",flightnurse," For MY16 a similar options 340i is less then a MY15 335i. On the 340i LED headlights are now standard, BMW has shifted many items around, option packages have changed,"
1977,"June 26, 2015  1:36PM",graphicguy,"FN...looked for the 340 on TrueCar last night. They don't have it listed yet. I would imagine the lack of discounts on them is still going to put it above where I would want to budget a car/if I get a new car. I mentioned before, I like these new turbo 4 motors. They are torquey and it's amazing to me how they've almost removed any turbo lag. But, some are a little coarse. BMW falls into that category (as does the one in the CTS).  Looking at the 335i xDrive equipped the way I want puts me well into the low-mid $50s. The ""5"" in that number is a place I don't want to be.  Mercedes 2.0L turbo is smooth, as is the one in the Audi A4.  Still not as silky as say the 6 in the S4, IS 350 or TLX SH AWD, though. Ideally, Acura would slap a urbo on their 3.5L V6. For some reason, except for the previous RDX, Acura has shied away from turbos.  Thursday night, passed by the local Acura dealer. They looked dead. Hooked up with my favorite sales person to get an extended test drive of a TLX SH AWD Advance. You can immediately tell they shaved weight from the previous TL for that car. Much more refined, too....especially the suspension. Handles well. Great leather sports seats, as always. Tight as a drum...even the door slam sounds expensive. Pushbutton trans would trake some getting used to. Stereo, as always was ""killer"". Not sure what to think of the dual screen layout. Again, seems like the answer to a question no one asked. Relatively quick....thinking mid-high 5 sec range in the 60 romp according to my buttometer...about the same as my previous TL.  Sticker said 46K. Haven't looked at pricing since I'm not in the market. I dunno...thinking it would land somewhere in the low $40s. Very nice car for that kind of money. Performs well. Has all the ""stuff"" you could possibly want. Built well, as always. Looks good (finally). But, I've always liked the looks of previous gens."

1980,"June 19, 2015 12:37AM",flightnurse," If you bought the S4 to hold it's value you made a big mistake. I have 30K on my 320i and it's not even 2 yrs old, if you are worrying about mileage on your car, then next time purchase a Dodge Dart. Since your S4 has been in an accident, the value has has been depreciated already."
1981,"June 21, 2015 10:27PM",andres3," Well, I'd have to trust the wife with the pricey S4, and she doesn't have a long commute, but she still works 5 days per week so it would still be gaining miles. She's a good driver but I wouldn't trust her 100% with the S4 until she completes a HPDE weekend (which so far I've been unsuccessful in getting her to try). Even with me behind the wheel, someone managed to get into a wreck with the S4 by being just horrible.  I'm not sure the WRX STI would depreciate slower than the S4; especially considering the S4 now has 25,000 miles whereas I'm assuming you meant get a brand new WRX STI. The first 25,000 miles are the biggest.  If I could live with a stick for a daily driver on congested freeways, The STI would be right up my alley. Since I don't want a stick for daily duty, Subaru is out until they develop a good dual clutch auto-manual transmission. At least they don't' embarrass the STi with a CVT option. The Golf R would be a good alternative...., but even if the S4's extra weight keeps it from handling as well, the tuning options on the S4 are quite extraordinary. You can basically turn it into an AWD muscle car that handles reasonably great considering its weight.  The other consideration is the wife is starting to itch for a new vehicle after 8 years with the Civic. Something roomier would be nice since we have a 19-1/2 month old now, and possible wishes for a 2nd in the near future. The Golf SportWagon just surpassed the Forester in the running... TDI; great mileage, and right now diesel is cheap. It is ""JUUUUUSSSST"" big enough with the significantly elongated rear end, and I'm not sure any vehicle is as space efficient as the new Golfs/GTI's.  The S4 has performed exemplary as the Sport Sedan disguised as a Family Sedan thus far. 2 kids is pushing it though; but maybe not until at least one of them is much older. The worst thing is being told you should go rear-facing with the car seat up to 2 years. Rear-facing takes up MUCH MORE room than front-facing, and I think the statistics that say it's 5X safer are skewed by really bad drivers."
1982,"June 21, 2015 10:38PM",andres3,"According to the small claims judge the accident's diminished value was only worth $3K That being said, it is still twice as much as the insurance company wanted to part with. $3,000 could pay for some nice modifications and improvements to increase my enjoyment even more.  I just didn't plan on racking up so many miles so quickly. I'll be at 30K before you know it. Isn't there data to figure you've spent at least .25/mile? I'm probably overreacting, but I don't hate the Civic. I need to put a better sound system in it though."
1983,"June 21, 2015 11:05PM",flightnurse," I think your priorities are askew, the accident will be the big issue not your miles when you go and sell it."
1984,"June 22, 2015  6:06AM",tlong,"I guess I always figured that unless somebody was leasing, I bought the car so I might as well enjoy it. I keep my cars a long time so I don't worry about limiting my miles, I intend to use the car to the maximum. Currently at 152K on my '05 Acura TL and will probably keep it another year or so. I would say drive the car and enjoy it (the S4) and don't worry about resale value unless that is something critical to you."
1985,"June 22, 2015  7:26AM",andres3," I agree, I'm an Audi buyer and I wouldn't touch one that has been in a moderate to major accident with a ten foot pole. Not without a big steep discount. Luckily I can just keep mine long term as it turns out it has been extremely reliable not only before the accident, but after (less one coolant hose debacle). The problem is (and the big difference is) you have some control over your miles (move your residence or buy an extra car), but you have no control over an accident that is in the history books, nor future accidents (not at fault) for that matter."

Of course, I don't have much fun doing the typical route on the freeway being stuck behind mind numbing traffic. However, as I've previously mentioned; I've found a very fun route home that doesn't cost much extra time but most definitely costs me extra fuel, brakes and tires.

1993,"June 23, 2015  3:54AM",tlong," Well, I'm underwhelmed by some of the cars out these days. While I could afford a quite expensive car it is not in my current desire to spend more than perhaps $35K or so. My preferences are mildly sporty but nicely appointed smaller cars. So I'm thinking either a fully loaded Mazda 3 which handles really well and can have a pretty nice interior; or perhaps a used C-class. I don't find the Bimmers nice enough inside for my tastes. I'm ok with the current A4 but frankly don't want to spend that much - I found my '98 A4 at least as appealing as the current model. And I really lament the scarcity of manual transmissions and that is probably one reason that I'm not overly motivated by a lot of the available choices. I might consider something like a VW GTI but I'm not inclined to deal with VW and their parts and service again. I find the current Jetta a bore-fest.  Part of the reason I've kept the TL so long is that it is really reliable and I've not found anything that moves me a whole lot at a decent price point. So I keep driving the TL while waiting for something more interesting to come along."

1995,"June 23, 2015 12:22PM",nyccarguy,"  It is funny that you say that. I feel the same way: ""underwhelmed"" by not just some, but a lot of cars out there these days. Nothing jumps out at me in the looks or driving department that makes me start thinking about how long until I'm even or have equity on the loan of my Subaru. I look at the price I paid for my Subaru, the features it has that I really like (AWD, Heated Seats) and also what my monthly payment is. No my car isn't perfect, it could use more giddyup. I look at different cars and say to myself, OK this is nice, but not worth $X thousand more than my Legacy and definitely not worth $X more per month.  You are going to have a tough time going from your V6 powered TL to a 4 Cyl Mazda 3 though."
1996,"June 23, 2015 12:30PM",Michaell," I don't know about that ... didn't that iteration of the TL have 225 HP? The Mazda, in ""s"" trim, has 185 HP. And, the power to weight ratio might be pretty similar.  Yeah, you're giving up the smoothness of the 6 for the potential buzziness of the 4, but the better mileage may make up for that."
1997,"June 23, 2015  1:13PM",graphicguy,"tlong....good points. Only for a different reason, I keep crossing off cars off my list that might be interesting, but could be potentially a hassle to own. My CTS comes immediately to mind. Good looking. Has all the ""right stuff"". But, just a nightmare to own."
1998,"June 23, 2015  2:47PM",tlong," One thing I forgot to mention is that I also looked at the A3 - while I do like my cars a bit smaller (I find my TL borderline too big), the A3 was just too tight for me to like and seemed a bit too cheap inside.  Regarding the Mazda, we do have an '07 Mazda 5 and I find the 4 cyl quite refined for a 4. Of course it is not a hot rod but it has a tighter turning circle, better steering feel, and is way more agile than my TL, which is probably why I would consider the Mazda 3. A fully loaded 3 is almost like a baby Bimmer and fully loaded seems to be just as nice from an interior POV, an area where to me the 3-series has always fallen a bit short."
1999,"June 23, 2015  3:51PM",sandman_6472,"Funny how we all have different tastes in vehicles. The wife really likes her A3 even better than her old Mazda3s which she really liked. As to being cheap inside, seems fine to us but it's the most expensive vehicle we've ever owned and our first German make...to be honest, if I had the funds, I would've gotten one instead of my Golf but feel like I got a 2/3 A3 right now. The smaller size of both vehicles was a major reason for purchasing what we did as we both like a small vehicle and we both got what we wanted here! Reliability wise, her A3 has been stellar unlike my Golf with 2 unplanned dealer visits in 5 months...can't blame the rims/tires issue on them really as I wanted the swap in the first place. Driving near the VW store this morning, saw the TDI wheels I originally wanted and still a bit pissed that they didn't listen to me but like what they substituted as I only see them on Jetta SEL models. Just wondering what'll happen once the warranty ends on both of them...if any major problems crop up and if we'll both keep them over the eight to nine year plan, Plan A. Time will tell but being the optimist that I am, I'm saying that we'll both make it to year eight...and possibly 9!  The Sandman"

Breaking news. Is it 2015 or 1995? His CTS is outgunning my Neon right now for Lemon of the Century. At least my Neon didn't become a complete lemon until after year 3 was over by 1 day. Even worse when I hit 36,000 miles probably just before year 4. That being said, it did need to be towed the first morning after it's first night in the garage at home. For balance, Dodge never told me they couldn't fix it."
2004,"June 23, 2015 11:09PM",andres3," How's the mileage with the TDI? Strongly considering a Golf SportWagen TDI for the wife. It is winning out over the Forester, even the Forester XT with leather.  Regarding another post about Mazda's and Audi's, I too, find the new A3 interior to be a bit of a let down, but only as compared to what is expected of Audi interiors. I think the '06+ A3 interior was superior. Of course, a GTI today can cost more than my A3 did in 2006, so inflation is a factor. I would say the A3 still has a better interior than any Mazda, but of course you pay for it. Nothing against Mazda, and not trying to bash them, but this is my impression from the last Mazda 3 rental I had a few years back:  1) All-around good economy car. 2) Coming from then being a current A3 owner, it felt like it had really thin sheet metal. Experience felt like I was driving a tin can car down the road as compared to the A3 being a bank vault or tank. Tin can is a bit harsh, probably more appropriate to use that term on the late 90's Kia Sephia rental I had. But there is a noticeable difference."

2008,"June 24, 2015  2:37AM",tlong," Perhaps when I mentioned cheap inside, I'm also subconsciously adding ""...for the price"". I could get a stripper A3 for the low $30's, or a max loaded Mazda 3 for the high $20's - and the 3 has more equipment by far at those respective prices, as well as (I think) a bit more space inside but still a small package. I might also consider a manual on the Mazda 3 if I could get one fully loaded - something not available any more on the Audis.  I think I favor a bit more of the luxury side compared to some of those on this board since obviously if I wanted pure speed/handling I could go BMW. To get decent luxury in a BMW you pretty much need to add $10K for all the options and even then IMHO the Audis are nicer. But the prices on the Audis have gone somewhat stratospheric since I bought my '98 A4 brand new. At that time the Audi was pretty loaded for the same price as a low end 3-series that was a lot more stripped. Nowadays Audi (to their credit) is seen much more positively than they were in the late '90s."
2009,"June 24, 2015  2:42AM",tlong," I did sit in the TLX and ILX recently in the showroom. I was surprised to feel that the TLX is really not so different in size or style than my '05 TL - a full 10 years older! The shapes are familiar, the interior still looks familiar, with the expected tarting up of LEDs, different fascias, bumpers, etc. My TL is like 250hp v6 and why would I buy a 4 cyl TLX for the same price or more than I paid for my TL? Too similar for my tastes and although the TL has been a great car, I guess I need a change and the TLX isn't it. I also find the TL/TLX just a bit bigger than I like and I want something a bit smaller and more agile. My TL is nice but a bit too much of a barge for me - which is why even our Mazda 5 feels so nice even though much less power. I'm looking for that tight steering and agility with some luxury. Power per se isn't critically important but refinement is more important."

2015,"June 12, 2015 12:58PM",graphicguy,  Mark...asking you this question given how much you love Audi. Am I reading correctly that the new A4s are dropping HP and torque to go to a less powerful 4 cyl motor? That seems to fly in the face of everything the other ELLPS competitors are doing.
2016,"June 12, 2015  4:35PM",markcincinnati,"I have been told by my rep at The Audi Connection that HP & Torque of ALL the [US] Audi power-plants will increase. We saw, already, the 2016 A6 3.0T adopt the S4 tuning (raised the A6 to 333 HP, just like my A4), and the S6/S7 cranked up the HP or Torque or both, too.  The little engine that could (the 2.0T) has had its power bumped from 200, to 211, to 220 and I believe will be again goosed to 240. Under the four-rings, the torque was always pretty strong at 258 at sub 2,000 RPMs.  And, without breaking a sweat, apparently, Audi really goosed the 4-cylinder to just south of 300HP for the S3, even though there is a lame-o 2.0T (at 200HP and 207lb/ft) in the Q3 (this, I am assured, is temporary, the Q3 will soon come with the beefier 2.0T).  My dealer rep says, too, that ""it just won't do"" for the A6 and the S4 to share the same power rating -- if only for marketing reasons (which is not the case), so the S4 (upcoming) will have more HP and Torque. Of course another reason for the bump in power for the S4 is to make sure that as one aspires to the next Audi up the ladder -- say from S3, to S4, to S6/S7 to S8, etc. -- that the S3 doesn't outgun the S4 (which either it does currently or can, according to the test reports in the big auto magazines). The S6 has to beat the S4, too, in terms of power and measured acceleration times. And so on and so forth. . . .  I would look over a couple year period for the performance envelope to be pushed (upward) by increases, across the lineup, of HP and Torque.  Now, of course, we will have engines other than gas and hybrids and so on -- my assumption is that if the diesel SQ5 were to be offered (in the US) even though it's HP would be down, its torque would be up and through tuning and transmission choices, the ""S"" - ness of the vehicle would not be compromised.  Probably wishful thinking on my part to imagine Audi of America would actually bring the SQ5 in diesel trim to the US.  Look for all of the Europeans, Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Volvo and VW to name just a few, to continue the march upward in HP and Torque achieved using 4, 5 and 6 cylinder engines and dropping or reducing the number of and application of V8s, V10s, V12s and W12s.  I have not heard anything about decreasing the power,  Of course, you could be thinking of the smaller displacement engines Audi (among others) offers in markets other than the US. There are smaller (than 2.0T) engines offered by Audi in some of its cars in Europe, for example -- both in gas and diesel configurations.  My answer assumes you were talking about US bound Audi engine offerings."

A nice performance advantage over other cars in the 50K arena if you ask me. Is the S3 really going to outperform the S4, or just maybe keep up?"

2031,"June 18, 2015  6:49PM",markcincinnati,"I did like, very much, my TL SH-AWD, also liked my wife's Infiniti FX -- the engine in the FX did seem a bit more coarse than something that had an MSRP of $50K ought to have had, however. Both of us wanted to love our Japanese vehicles. There was really nothing wrong with either one of them, but they could not hold us since they lacked that je ne sais quoi that even a stripped Jetta is imbued with.  You can -- and some folks here do -- remark on either the reliability or durability or both sometimes associated with owning a German car. Our experience with German cars has been very positive overall. Yet, we know about the rumors swirling around about the eventual breathtakingly expensive maintenance and repairs that we surely will face if we keep our Germans beyond, 60,000, 70,000 or even more miles.  I can't argue that these dire consequences don't await us, for the highest mileage we've ever kept a German car has been 66K miles -- and that Audi felt ""new"" to me the day I traded it in (on another Audi).  The European cars, most notably the German ones are, somehow, addictive to drive. I would suspect the Japanese cars still haven't cracked the code of how to be a driver's car -- no matter how highly contented or carefree they may ultimately be.  For instance: The Golf R or GTI seem to be quite the bargains, and the car magazines do shower them with many positive comments and pounds of prose extolling their driving virtues. It seems to be that the same is said less often about cars from the other continents.  I do understand, support and agree with everyone's right to choose to drive what Automobile or Car & Driver, et al, magazine would call 'boring cars,' but I do wonder if those who decry my critical comments about said 'boring cars' have actually spent much time behind the wheel of one of the German cars (from Audi, BMW, Mercedes and Porsche) so often fawned over by enthusiast magazine journalists? If I have misread this, I apologize without further ado.  You may love your fill-in-the-blank and think my [admittedly] biased perspectives elitist or even ignorant, and that is fine with me -- I leave this post, however, once again urging you to test drive, test drive, test drive and keep test driving as many cars as possible. Makes the weekends very interesting, that much is certain.  A friend of mine always ends up buying/leasing KIA's and/or Mazda's all the while waxing darn near poetic on the virtues of Audis, BMWs, Mercedes, Porsches and even a few of VW's offerings. He always wants to ""test"" my cars -- and then ultimately goes for the KIA Optima or the Mazda 3 or 6 citing that he is ""too frugal"" to go for the ""superior sports sedan""-- electing to go for the Optima which he says is better than they used to be in the suspension department and since they poached the car's designer from Audi AG, well, ""the KIA Optima is great looking too.""  I can't find fault with him for wanting to be frugal -- I really don't find fault at all with his designation of what to spend his money on, of course. I do find myself confused -- I would think he (or anyone who seems to say one thing and do another) must suffer from chronic cognitive dissonance, however.

Perhaps in addition to being confused by my friend's decision to go with the thing he thinks is inferior to the BMW (or whatever) he really wants, I am made somewhat sad that he -- a very close friend -- seems to have such passion for something that is not the thing he will go ahead and spend on.  There is always somewhat of a tone, a lament, as he apparently rationalizes not going for the ""thing"" about which he waxes oh so poetic and is also very knowledgeable about. He cites chapter and verse the performance stats and specifications of this, that and the other Porsche or BMW, etc, then apologizes for the KIA. This is a very successful and well educated guy. Perhaps it is that this behavior seems out of character.  He has no need to apologize -- to me at least -- for his decision. Our friendship is not based upon his possessions -- and there is no way he could think that the case. Had I the means and a spouse who would permit, I'd get him an M3 or 5 series for pity's sake and hopefully enjoy -- vicariously -- him drive it.  I guess a perspective could be that we all settle -- but I don't think that is the planet you are referring to. I do believe most people, most of the time, seek out and acquire the best ""things"" they can.  If we all hyper-extended ourselves, we all could -- for a time -- live well beyond our means. I believe most of us with decent incomes and relatively to very good credit scores could ""score"" a $100,000 car. I assume, considering that most of us here are discussing cars that have a median or even mean cost of $50,000+/-, we could ""get a $100K car done."" By that standard, I would have to concede I have settled. I don't live or think that way -- in the particular case of the car, every mile I drive in my car has, so far, been better than the last. I'm driving what I want to drive (not that I don't also have interest in something better).  Actually, it was the emotional impact of my friend, rather than touting the virtues of his new Optima, chose lamenting that it wasn't a BMW (5 series, as I recall). That's what got to me.  Every mile a smile, as my wife says. If someone willfully, knowingly and deliberately starts down a path that they think will be every mile a ""frown"", well that too would be some other planet than the one I've lived on for some six decades."

Going in, I knew this could happen so I wasn't too unhappy when they came and let me know they'd be sending me home in a loaner. Today, I tried to charge my cell in the two power plugs and nothing happened, tried multiple chargers and nothing worked so will have to stop over tomorrow and see what's up. Thinking it will be a blown fuse at this point and hope it is...if not, we'll see how they handle it. Must say this kind of issue never happened with our Toyota's, Honda or Hyundai's but again, I knew going in with any VW product that there might be some issues to deal with. And with both the A3 and Golf being first year models, things do happrn!  The Sandman"
2043,"June 10, 2015  1:43PM",markcincinnati," I do like German cars -- but I also liked my Acura TL, often comparing it favorably to an S4. Assuming you're correct regarding the ""popularity"" of VW for the reasons you cite (and I am taking your assertions as accurate), it is a shame. Since the cars' reliability and/or durability and the dealer experiences apparently suck, I can understand their waning sales. Yet, this Jetta is solid, the transmission is great and the steering is communicative. Now, in the course of 700 miles, assuming I have no reliability issues, my perception of the greatness of the car will probably remain unchanged.  VW should be ashamed of itself if the reliability and dealer experience isn't corrected sooner rather than later.  Speaking of perspectives, I also enjoyed our Infiniti -- kept it 39 months, and other than a new set of tires, the thing was as close to flawless (in terms of the driving experience, reliability and durability) as one would expect. I did test the Q50S, the Lexus 350 F-Sport (and even ordered one) -- so I can understand and support several non-German cars as great. My specific rant pertaining to Toyotas was just that, remarks pertaining to Toyota, not all non-German cars.  I do test drive a lot of cars, and I rent a lot of cars -- the rental experiences typically allow me to drive hundreds of miles in a given example. The Toyotas typically and specifically are a huge disappointment -- which confuses me considering their apparent sales successes. Hondas, to name another Asian brand, on the other hand, do not suffer from this good enough approach. The Hyundai Genesis, and Kia Optoma too are examples of cars that certain seem to not be satisfied with a good enough approach.  A few days ago when I started this ""I'm disappointed in"" Toyota thread, I did only mention Toyota and that still stands. The phrase, ""I hate Toyotas"" is simply my way, in this forum of supporting the notion that good is the enemy of great.  The good news is, it certainly seems that a lot of folks are participating and voicing their opinions on this and other subjects, which, from my perspective is a good thing, what this ""tool"" (the Edmunds forum) is all about."

Even if you were to go over your lease miles by 700, that's what $175 at $.25 per mile.  You're most likely going to get another Audi, so they might wave the excess miles or the dealership which you've bought 29 of your Audis from will do something for you to make it right.

But equipping an R/T with Tech, Premium, and Nav gets $43,595 while a Scat Pack is $45,175 with Tech ... but I can't get Nav in that car?? And somehow leather seats are bundled in the Tech pack with the Scat Pack but not the Tech pack in the R/T. SSSOOOO confusing.  Oh, wait, found the Nav as a standalone option on the Scat Pack.

And Dodge has a few performance pieces that add about 20 hp without affecting the warranty. I still have the CPO '15 WRX STI to check out. I didn't know that the vanilla WRX got EPS while the STI tiller is still hydraulic. A BIG plus for me(along with the Brembo Brakes, no hole in the roof, and configurable torque split).

2063,"June 11, 2015 12:38PM",markcincinnati," This trip was a business trip -- a second demonstration of software my company sells to a large prospect. A very good revenue opportunity. I am one of the owners of the company and the CEO. The CTO of the company and I were going to make a two-hour presentation and move the needle toward ""buy."" When we travel for marketing reasons we figure any flight takes about 4 hours all in. Chicago, drive. Cleveland, drive. New York, fly. Nashville @ 3:45, drive (and besides the cost of 2 round trip tickets was over $2K). We pay $.55 per mile for using ""your"" personal car. The rental plus gas for this trip was about $150, hotel another $240 (we stayed at the ""Maxwell House""). At over 600 miles total, there would have been a significant cost increase in using a personal vehicle.  What kind of example would it set if I used a personal car and charged the company @$.55 per mile x 600+ miles? The next trip to, er, Pittsburgh where I am not going would cost what?  So, driving it like I live is EXACTLY what I did.  Now, were I to return to Nashville for a pleasure trip (and Nashville is worthy of such a trip if you axed me), I would take either the S4 or the SQ5.  By the way, the return trip, at 85mph further solidified my opinion that even a bare bones Jetta really is in no danger of being called the enemy of great -- this car IS great.  While in Nasville, I saw and looked into a new Maxima -- in some kind of deep red-wine metallic color with sick wheels. Wow -- this is a looker, I'll give it that. And, afterwards I went on-line to ""build"" one -- they can be had fully decked out in sport trim for an MSRP under $40K. Actual prices, I would assume would be less. Of course, looks can be superficial -- but to repeat, this car has the looks.  In any case, given the circumstances, would you have said to your colleagues, ""the most expensive way to get to and from Nashville, by car, is the way we're gonna do it?""  Not if you drive it like you live, you wouldn't."

Dealers within a 3-4 mile radius of the Grinder place.  Observations...  -As big as the new Chevy Tahoe is, it's a looker. -Escalade must be doing well. We saw 4 of them turnaround with dealer tags....big and lit up like Christmas -saw one Mercedes CLS (very sharp), 2 CLAs, and one C Class that hooked like demos pulling in and out of the parking lot -numerous A4s, a6s and whatever the small SUV is that Audi is selling pulling in and out of their dealer"
2070,"June  6, 2015  6:07PM",tlong," Interesting numbers that show the power of brand equity. BMW may have softer steering but their reputation will take decades to unravel even if they don't spiff up their latest 3-series. Audi is arguably nicer but look at their sales.

It takes a car company as long to crawl out of the hole it dug for itself, as it did to dig it in the first place. So if Cadillac went on the skids 1975-1995, then it's about time for a rebirth. But don't count on this company ever reclaiming its former glory from the 1950s. The market has expanded too much and the competition is a lot more fierce.

2077,"June  8, 2015  9:08PM",markcincinnati," Counter-counterpoint:  With a smile on my face and malice toward none, this seems somewhat of an apology on behalf of Toyota. My point and question is why not build a great car at every price point. I do think the Toyota is probably a good car -- and, as someone says (not just someone but Voltaire, born in 1694) -- ""good is the enemy of great.""  I would agree with something here -- ""95% of the buying public has no . . . need for an ELLPS."" Their interest level is harder to ascertain, but, assuming you are correct that 95% have no interest, I would be made both sad and fearful. I assume you assume they -- the 95% -- have no interest because . . .um, they have never been exposed to greatness (at THAT particular price point)?  Let me give you an irrelevant comparison -- while growing up, my mother fixed this nasty-tasting ""entree"" she called salmon patties. They looked like a cross between a hamburger and what, today, I think of as a mostly-crab, crab-cake. The taste, after frying was, well, horrible. But, hey, it's Friday so well it was either fried smelt or salmon patties; so after a while I actually ate the salmon patties entirely. I don't think I ever liked them, but I did learn to tolerate them. Eventually, in a sentimental, not logical or rational, moment I was told I actually said (I deny this) ""salmon patties are good."" Perhaps, salmon patties are good compared to, er, hmm, DIRT!  Time and tide, time and tide -- and I eat (in college) at a nice restaurant and the special of the day is salmon. First off, when it comes, I barely recognize it, and then when I taste it, I know for sure ""this sure as hell isn't salmon!"" Salmon is great, I love salmon -- I had grown to accept canned salmon [allegedly] as good.  How much is an Avalon or a Camry? Don't answer that, the point is not how much it costs it's that for THAT much money, it ought to be possible to build a great car, not just a good one that has a lot of stuff for the money. Now, if the stuff is what actually makes it great -- and NOT the driving experience or its capabilities -- well, then I don't know what we're all talking about here. We COULD add navigation and blu-tooth to a Trabant I would assume, but that wouldn't make it even a good car, it would still be a bad car that just happen to have sat-nav.  I don't think everyone needs or wants or should need or want an ELLPS -- I do think we all deserve to know what real salmon tastes like, so to speak. These super popular ['good' car] brands, Toyota being the one I chose to exemplify my point, are just one of the contributors the great dumbing-down we're ""enjoying"" these days."

When I worked for a government contractor, we had to continually stress to our design engineers that the customer asked for a Chevy and we shouldn't build a Rolls Royce.    Mainstream cars (in my case Hondas) are good enough for 95% of US drivers.  I have had fresh salmon - two Mercedes bought new - but Honda/Toyota/etc serve my purposes perfectly.  We each should buy what fills our needs, and no one should belittle those choices.  You were not doing that but I have seen others that do so.

Those who don't care about great handling, but just want an inexpensive, reliable, made well-enough transportation from A to B should get their priorities straightened out, or else.  It's a bit like somebody lamenting all those factory-made suits - if everybody just went to a tailor, world would be so much better place, wouldn't it (we wouldn't have to look at cheap suits)?

What or where or when did I suggest that I would compare a Rolls to a Honda. My point has been to start a conversation regarding greatness at a given price point -- any price point. Somehow, however, it seems that we're actually now saying that ""good enough"" is, hmm, good enough.  Do we now tell our children, their teachers, our leaders, etc, that it is ""OK"" to not go for great?  How could it belittle anyone to urge them to strive for ""the best"" (at every price point) -- I've not suggested that the customer who shops for a Chevy is any less entitled to the best (at that price point) than is the Rolls buyer (at that price point).  Everything made and done is not great -- I assume we all would agree to that. I am hoping to spark the conversation to perhaps contemplate that we simply shouldn't settle for good enough no matter how much or little we pay.  I just think that good enough or good has begat an erosion of what we'll accept -- hence the term dumbing-down. We, at times, seem complacent -- we accept good enough, we don't ""demand"" great.  Again and finally -- I keep saying ""at every, at any . . .price point.""  Good enough isn't."

So that is who defines them as being great. I like Mark, but the Camry is beneath he and his wife, he has every right not to call the Camry or Accord not great cars.  Some people look at cars are appliances, and those are the people who look at a 20K Camry and call them great, they don't care about handling or acceleration, they are looking for a comfortable car that starts every time they get into and doesn't cost a lot of money to maintain."

When I was hunting for HTS for our current house, I was amazed on what people wanted to sell me, one place told me for the money, Mirage speakers was great, but didn't like how they sounded. I had a very high end business talk to me about Transmission Audio, I'd never heard them before, but once I figured the the guy was playing with me, I had a good laugh, Price for the speakers, well, if you have to ask you can't afford them, but was told a million for each speaker.. So are they great speakers? To someone, yes, not to me they are not."
2088,"June  9, 2015  6:10PM",roadburner,"I was patient and bought most of my HTS components when they were discounted ahead of newer models being released. My basement gaming system was really put together on the cheap, picking up an Energy 5.1 system for less than 50% of MSRP and using the speaker cables and HTR from my previous 6.1 system that I replaced when I upgraded my main system to 7.1.

2092,"June  9, 2015  8:45PM",Mr_Shiftright,"Reminds me of that YouTube video where they gathered hard-core coffee aficionados to do a blind tasting. I thought that when they told the one guy he had picked McDonald's, he was going to commit ritual suicide right then and there."
2093,"June  9, 2015  9:01PM",roadburner, Funny you should mention that; there have been numerous double-blind tests conducted between different components and interconnects/cables- it seems that no one can hear a difference unless they know what they are listening to.
2094,"June  9, 2015  9:55PM",graphicguy,"Rockin' DefTech speakers, EMOTIVA pre/pro and dual Epik ( no longer in business) 18"" subs. Rolled my own speaker cabling and swear by Monoprice interconnects. Can't say as i've heard anything to beat it so far. Half tempted to go the Dolby Atmos , but if it ain't broke, why fix it?"
2095,"June 10, 2015 12:17AM",andres3,"Do you all follow the conventional rule of thumb or wisdom that says make your HT budget, then use 50% on speakers, 25% on power/processing, 15% on media/disk player(s), 10% on Cabling/wiring.  That's what I've seen and read in multiple places, and I think it's good advice. The equation isn't so simple when a friend already has pretty good bookshelves, and a lame duck Sony receiver. He's like how can Sony be lame? I just say receivers are not Sony's bread and butter unless you have an ES model.  I had him add a good old Energy 8"" sub woofer I sold him for $100 plus $15 for the cable, plus 1/2 of shipping. Then I had him add new 12 ga. Blue Jeans speaker cables most recently, with banana plug ends to replace his 100 ga. wire strands (I use the plural loosely; it was horrible how little wire he was using, but I'm joking about the 100 gauge. Most likely it was 20 ga or so but he had about 20% of the strands connected in the end at best. Night and Day improvements. I think about $200 best spent! In this case, 10 to 15% on wiring was wrong given his existing already installed situation."

2099,"June 10, 2015  1:49AM",markcincinnati,"Today, to save some miles and money, I rented a car from Enterprise to drive from Cincinnati to Nashville.  I asked for a full-size car and was presented with a new gas powered Jetta -- I assume it would be considered the base car. I have only a rough idea of how much this car costs. I have been given Nissan cars, Toyota cars, Jeeps and on and on as rentals. This was my first Jetta rental.  Drove the thing at a steady 80MPH stopping south of Bowling Green for a bio break.  Car's computer says 39.6MPG.  Compared to most of the cars that pass as full size rental fleet offerings, this seems to be the great car I started on about when I was being critical of Toyotas. Now, it has no nav, no power seats, no heated seats and the sound system is strictly AM and FM -- and if it has blu-tooth, well, I can't figure out how to make it work. But the car is competent, no, no, VERY competent at the thing that a car must be competent at -- the driving experience. It is, at its price point, great.  I would assume a stroll through the option list could make this car much more expensive and, yes, it would be ""nicer"" -- but how could it be anything else, starting with a great base car like this.  This is the salmon I wish dear ol' mom would have introduced me to.  My personal vehicles or my personal willingness to dump $X into a car have nothing to do with great vs good -- this Jetta should be purchased by other car companies, disassembled and examined and within reason imitated.  If this car can be produced and marketed for what I assume would be considered a ""cheap"" MSRP by ELLPS mfgrs and customers, there ought to be no reason others -- including Toyota -- couldn't do it, too.  You don't need to equate great with big bucks.  DOH!  Homer."
2100,"May 30, 2015 11:49PM",sweendogy,@robr2 and @graphic_guy - I've driven past the mb dealership and it's amazing - herb decided to shoehorn his mb in Somerville underneath a highway with limited parking and now packaged with a smart car dealership- no ideal for said customers but good for herb because they put a heli pad on the roof so very convenient for big Bruins or celtics games.   My used experience with herb was terrible because they tell you what you should pay- had issues with 2 cars Honda and Audi and bot elesewhere. 
2101,"May 31, 2015  2:46AM",graphicguy, I've heard of Herb....mostly out East. But. I'd never heard of Moreno until he moved into the Cincinnati area. He's done well in the short time he's been down this way.  My guess is he's put a significant dent in the Cincinnati new Mercedes market by takig away business from the established player in Montgomery and West Chester.
2102,"May 31, 2015  3:27PM",robr2," Moreno was an intern at Automobile magazine and then worked for Saturn. Chambers hired in as the manager of his Saturn store and Moreno moved up to VP supervising 9 Chambers' locations. In 2005, MB offered to finance his purchase of a struggling dealership in Cleveland. Since then he has opened up 30 stores - MB, Porsche, Acura, Lotus, Aston, Infiniti.  MB only opens a store if they see potential for increased business. They wouldn't saddle a business with a $20 million building if it was a zero sum game. I'm guessing there was a demand for that open point as south of Cincinnati since the next closest store is in Lexington. His store here in my town was considered an open point. It's equidistant from two other MB stores (about 20 miles). It serves the suburbs NW of Boston and also tens of thousands of potential customers who work in the executive parks in town."
2103,"June  1, 2015  2:32PM",dino001,"We talked here about Acura losing its way, not more precisely never really making it in this category. The latest TLX commercial is a perfect example - lack of its own identity seems not enough for them, they had to invoke that idiotic German (catchy, but meaningless) tune. The visual was actually not bad, but the tune simply idiotic. They should fire those who authorized it. There are many ways I could see TLX advertised, mostly as ""all-included"" luxury with a sporty slant. The last message they want to convey is ""me to"" (as there is enough of existing perception of that), but this stupid German tune does exactly that."
2104,"June  1, 2015  2:51PM",stickguy,At least it is a really nice car. I was quite smitten with the one I played around in last week while at the dealer.
2105,"June  1, 2015  3:04PM",dino001,"I attended BMW's annual drive event (they do those every late spring in my area) at my dealership. I like those, as you get a car without a salesman. I drove 428i Gran Coupe and souped up 335ix with sport transmission and bunch of other options, all M-Sport related. 335 was fast, but I already knew that before, so it didn't overwhelm me with awesome power. The new LCI steering update is just in time, as even souped up 335 still had that soft feel.  The positive surprise was 428 GC. It was Luxury Line. I think they continue working on this engine and it probably improved since the introduction. I pushed it harder this time and it produced a decent low-pitch grunt that I didn't hear before. I also proved fairly quick. I was skeptical for long time, but I'm warming up a little to a possibility of giving up on the six-cylinder for the economy (both price and fuel). The steering in 428 was also a bit better than 335 (there are wider wheeltrack and same wheelbase, also reportedly slight suspension differences between 3- and 4-series). LCI could not have come fast enough, let's hope some of that steering feedback is restored. I anticipate even 4-series will benefit, too, hopefully they'll bring it sooner than full year from now.  I suspect that once the LCI dust settles it will be for me between 328 wagon and 428 or 435 Grand Coupe. There is also Gran Turismo, but it's too cow-ish so far. I have time to decide. Seems it works for my benefit - the deals will get better, as the model ages. The reliability should also go up."
2106,"June  1, 2015  3:08PM",robr2," Well I think the idea is to create an atmosphere that the TLX is just as good as your German sedan hence the tagline ""How do you say your lease is up in German?"""

2108,"June  1, 2015  9:04PM",circlew,"The Q50 lost to the TLX in a few reviews, not by much, however. After a few months, I really like the lower NVH from the last gen G. (They have dealer-installed kit to enhance the exhaust note that a review thought was very effective.)  Also liked the Q style over the TLX. The sport seats are great but I believe BMW is a notch up, IMHO. I could live in the Q for many miles at a time!"
2109,"June  3, 2015  3:13AM",markcincinnati,"It's after 11PM, I'm feeling a bit peckish -- and for some reason I feel the need to post the following:  I, for reasons that would take more explanation that worthwhile, hate Toyotas -- and, after today, I have to say, I really hate the Avalon even more than the Camry, if that is possible.  I'll, for me, net this out -- good is the enemy of great. Toyota's, especially the two noted above, are the epitome of good cars -- and that is what makes them so, er, hate-worthy.  I know these are really very popular cars -- the things are everywhere.  Isn't there any way to make great cars at every price point?  Really, really -- good is the enemy of great and, therefore, perhaps, good is evil as it makes us dumb down our expectations. While these cars may be incredibly reliable, they suck the joy out of driving and will be, in the end, the reason self-driving cars will be here in an alarmingly short time from now.  Not sure, but I can make the case for hating Lexus products (for the most part) too.  I need a sandwich."
2110,"June  3, 2015 11:18AM",dino001,"I would not buy Toyota vehicle, although I noticed they improved their styling and interiors considerably. In its own right, Toyotas are actually great cars, they just emphasize things that are not important to you and ignore those that are. If you ever watched Top Gear episode on Hilux (Euro version of Tacoma), you'd absolutely say that Toyota makes great cars - for those who have particular expectations, vastly different from yours. To hate Toyota the way you describe it, is to hold all those people in contempt and declare your life priorities as the only ones worth considering, which I think is too far. Some people simply care about price, fuel economy and durability, cheap maintenance. Toyota absolutely excels in those. Those people buy their vehicles to keep them for 10 years, they'd rather spend the money somewhere else. Those are valid life choices, regardless how hard you find that to fathom. You may still hate them, but to say they don't make great cars is only an opinion, not fact."
2111,"June  3, 2015  1:45PM",m6user,"dino001, excellent points.  Lot of folks out there don't consider driving to be joyful but a chore in need of a tool.  A cheap but dependable tool.  "
2112,"June  3, 2015  3:19PM",kyfdx,"Counterpoint..  Camrys and Avalons are great... at doing what they were designed for. I'd posit that they are better at their intended function, than most of the cars in this discussion.  As an ELLPS, probably not that great. But, that's not what they are.  95% of the buying public has no interest or need for an ELLPS. They need reliable, comfortable, efficient transportation. The Camry and Avalon are great at that.  Don't see how that has an effect on how great your ELLPS might be. Maybe it's the 95% of people that you have a problem with, not the car companies that give them exactly what they want and need."
2113,"June  3, 2015  3:48PM",billyperks4,Agree KYFDX- had a 1994 Camry that my wife (at the time girlfriend) acquired as a gift-it lasted us for quiet some years with zero issues.

2115,"June  3, 2015  4:03PM",dino001,"BTW, that Hilux episode of Top Gear was amazing. They beat the snit of it, subjecting it to all kinds of abuses. starting ""gently"" by numerous fender benders, escalating to more and more serious peril. They submerged it in the Ocean by leaving the truck on a beach with highest tides in the world and the thing started afterwards. They tried to kill it multiple times and it would not die."

The Toyotas did what I expected of them - Provide good, reliable transportation. The 2005 Avalon was a great highway cruiser. Very solid and comfortable. Fun to drive - Not so much. I get that from the Volvo. I guess it all depends on what you're looking for when you make the purchase. At the time I bought the Toyotas, fun to drive was not high on my list of priorities, as I was building a career and raising a family. I now have the option of indulging my fun to drive craving. I still have a lot of appreciation for what Toyota offers to car buyers."

Then I saw the Arrest me red 2015 Dodge Challenger, first time driving the LH cars with the new 8 spd transmission and updated interior. WOW.. What a fun car, even though it rained the entire time I was in Jersey the car was still fun. Nice thick leather steering wheel, If I was blind folded and felt the wheel, I would have sworn it was the M Sport Wheel from BMW, that is how nice it was. The transmission had a sport mode, which only seemed to change the shift pattern of the transmission to be more aggressive, the seats were very nice, comfortable and supportive. Fit and Finish was first rate, the dash, door panels felt nice..  Even though the LH cars are big, they drive great, I was very surprised on how well they drive...

Now Toyota is running ads proclaiming the ""Bold, New Camry"". Since doesn't look particularly new and has no outstanding performance characteristics I think they're making a mistake.

As for Kelly, he has the north shore Fiat and Herb has the north shore Chrysler/Dodge/Ram. Herb got Fiat in metro west/Worcester because he has the Chrysler/Dodge/Ram there and thus he got Alfa.  IMHO, many automakers are leery of Chambers as they feel he has too much power in such a small area. MB brought in a dealer group from Cleveland for the new MB location in my town - about 1/2 mile from the Chambers Audi/Porsche location. Chambers through his attorney has accused the planning board of impropriety in their approval of the MB store and has stated that the planning board is being too hard on Chambers' parking lot expansion at the Audi/Porsche store. The planning board is simply trying to ensure safety at that location. IIRC, that location did not finish the original project as approved. A building that was to be renovated was ""accidentally"" demolished. No U Turn signs have mysteriously disappeared a few times.

2138,"May 29, 2015  5:33PM",dino001,"Sport suspension IS NOT standard, read again. 328/335 has standard current Sport Line aesthetic elements and seats. You can get previous standard seats on 328/340 by getting premium package and luxury line (which is no cost) To get M-sport suspension (2VF adaptive or 704 regular), you need M-sport package or track package. However, they did say they have ""newly tuned"" the suspension and steering. If that delivers, it may be OK in standard form.  They still had to monkey with option configurations - up to now, whole ""Line"" thing was a mess. Can get this, but not that, etc. It's simplified and more available, BUT now you will be able get black with red stitching (which I love) only with regular suspension. ""Sporty red stitching"", which was the hallmark of the Sport Line is mutually exclusive with sport suspension elements, because it's not available with those M-sport packages. This is nuts.  They increased the price for 340, but the equipment offsets are more than sufficient, so overall value is better than current year. Actually, it's much better. However, there are also couple of slight of hands on 328 to make you believe you get more, but you don't. Premium package no longer has leather, but its price for 328 stays close to this year, because they swapped it for LED lights. 340 has all premium pack equipment standard, so that is not an issue. Leather is no a stand alone handsome $1450 option. I predict it will result in much more fake stuff showing in the dealers' inventories than this year. Now you could get leather as stand alone or as premium package, which was a frequent option. Once it's remove, it will probably be going to be first thing to go, for price conscious customers and ordering managers. BMW went essentially Mercedes way. I hate that.  So if you want 335, you better wait for 340, because it's going to be a better deal overall (unless you get some awesome discount to offset that difference). However, for 328 I see not much value added, just more shuffling to make you believe you're getting more. Good example is that leather vs. LED in premium package. The former has stable pricing in terms of supply, but they will be paying less and less for the LEDs (rapid development of new products pushes supply prices down in that segment), but keeping the profit for themselves.  The whole red stitching thing vs. sport suspension is just my personal disappointment, but not end of the world."

2141,"May 29, 2015  9:07PM",markcincinnati,"dino001 - I would disagree with ONE of your ""is ahead"" selections, and that would be the Acura. The Acura interior, while probably able to be applauded for its tech still seems to show its Honda-ness too much. In fact, the Acura and Infiniti interiors, today, just seem a lot cheaper looking than those from Audi and Mercedes. The slow-but-steady improvements in BMW's interiors since 2010 or 2011 certainly bears noting; but today the two Germans I noted certainly seem to offer best in class interiors.  When my wife and I test drove a Macan recently (to get a sense of just how much Audi SQ5 it retained), we both felt the Porsche interior was somewhat more upscale than the Audi's. I don't know if all Porsche interiors come off feeling that ""high end"" or not -- and it may not even matter since the cars are not typically cross shopped. Friend of our just got a 2016 A6 Prestige -- I'd say its interior does have some WOW factor.  I must say, though, I am not a fan of anybody's implementation of the ""pop-up"" screen. Looks after market to me."

The Sport line is now standard with the old sport line suspension as well as seats, in fact for $700 you can get the old DHP (Dynamic Handling Package) but the Variable Steering can be had on the standard Sport package, but can be had with the Track Package.  IF people do not want the Sport seats, then they just order the Luxury line which is a no cost options that comes with the old standard seats. dino001 said:  They still had to monkey with option configurations - up to now, whole ""Line"" thing was a mess. Can get this, but not that, etc. It's simplified and more available, BUT now you will be able get black with red stitching (which I love) only with regular suspension. ""Sporty red stitching"", which was the hallmark of the Sport Line is mutually exclusive with sport suspension elements, because it's not available with those M-sport packages. This is nuts.  They increased the price for 340, but the equipment offsets are more than sufficient, so overall value is better than current year. Actually, it's much better. However, there are also couple of slight of hands on 328 to make you believe you get more, but you don't. Premium package no longer has leather, but its price for 328 stays close to this year, because they swapped it for LED lights. 340 has all premium pack equipment standard, so that is not an issue. Leather is no a stand alone handsome $1450 option. I predict it will result in much more fake stuff showing in the dealers' inventories than this year. Now you could get leather as stand alone or as premium package, which was a frequent option. Once it's remove, it will probably be going to be first thing to go, for price conscious customers and ordering managers. BMW went essentially Mercedes way. I hate that.  So if you want 335, you better wait for 340, because it's going to be a better deal overall (unless you get some awesome discount to offset that difference). However, for 328 I see not much value added, just more shuffling to make you believe you're getting more. Good example is that leather vs. LED in premium package. The former has stable pricing in terms of supply, but they will be paying less and less for the LEDs (rapid development of new products pushes supply prices down in that segment), but keeping the profit for themselves.  The whole red stitching thing vs. sport suspension is just my personal disappointment, but not end of the world. The 340i is the real winner, I agree, you get a car wtih more standard features for less money then the 2015 335i."
2146,"May 30, 2015 12:55AM",flightnurse,Here is the ordering guide to show you Dino (and I highlighted) that the sport suspension is standard.
2147,"May 30, 2015  1:32AM",dino001,"There are three types of suspensions: standard, M-sport (704) available on ""i"" models with both ZMP and and ZTR and adaptive M-sport (2VF) available on ""i"" and ""x"" models with same packages. S-line is standard, indeed, but it was changed to not include 704, just like it didn't on ""x"" models. I stand by my statement. The standard suspension will be retuned to be more sporty, but that's not sport suspension."
2148,"May 30, 2015  1:48AM",stickguy,"man, BMW has gone off the rails with this stuff. between having about 20 different models, and these endless (and convoluted) option configurations, it could take a math PhD with a cray all day to figure out what to order!"

2150,"May 30, 2015  1:42PM",markcincinnati,"Just curious, what with the discussion about BMW's ""endless"" combination of options, etc: How many folks [here] buy/lease cars ""in-stock"" vs ordering and waiting? In my experience, the only person -- besides me -- I know who ""always"" orders her German cars is my wife.  In fact, our Audi dealer says that AoA's creation for the US market of Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige was created to ""simplify"" car buying (for who, the dealers? the customers?), by bundling options into groups that mirror what customers want.  This argument always confuses me since these option groupings seem to pop up somehow -- who is it that participated in a focus group that allowed the marketing folks to put ""this"" on Premium versions and ""that"" on Prestige, and so forth?  In any case, this BMW approach of offering endless combinations and permutations would seem to be car ordering people's dream come true -- but then I recall I really don't know anyone who regularly and frequently orders their new Audi, BMW or Mercedes. Moreover, the dealers' inventories continue to swell, which also would seem to discourage ordereing.  The question is posed: do more than 50% of ""us"" who participate in posting here actually order their new ELLPS cars, or do we get ""close enough for jazz"" and buy off the lot?"
2151,"May 30, 2015  2:44PM",roadburner,"I sometimes ordered my new BMWs(and once needed my salesperson to go to the mat with Munich when BMW wanted an ""optional"" sunroof to become mandatory), but the crux oof my complaint is that BMW still bundles some options. It's fine to offer packages that combine popular options at a perceived ""savings,"" but I wish that BMW would take a page out of Mini's playbook and make every option available individually. I suppose it's a moot point for me; after 32 years of continuous ownership(not to mention years of service in BMW CCA at both the chapter and national level) I've almost totally lost interest in the marque- I recently sold one of my BMWs and will likely cull at least one more from the fleet."
2152,"May 30, 2015  3:11PM",graphicguy,"Funny thing...I've heard people complain when they don't have enouhg options to craft a new car with the exact options they want, and others who complain about having too many options. Can't win if you're the manufcturer, it seems.  I don't know how BMW justifies all the options, as the cost for having such a laundry list of different possible configurations costs in parts inventory, admistrative overhead, and manufacturing complexity.  But, you pay for all of that flexibiity."
2153,"May 30, 2015  4:29PM",robr2," No doubt, Herb has great business. I bought two Hondas from him and felt the pricing was fair. As the biggest dealer in the Boston area, it's natural for him to be the biggest advertiser. At least he's not pretending to be working in the service department like Ernie Boch. I've looked at some used cars from Herb with smart pricing and checked over at Real World Trade In Values and the numbers are pretty much on target. The service at Honda is reasonable for basic things.  The MB dealership just up the street from Audi Burlington is an even more amazing place. The manicure bar is complimentary and all the sales associates are trained to properly prepare the Ospina coffee. They jumped through hoops in order to please the town in terms of trucks exiting the property and building design and are hosting town events at the dealership - next week is a high school art exhibit and reception. IIRC, total investment in the building was $15 million and they started up with over 100 MB's on opening day.  Bernie Moreno from Cleveland is the owner - he used to work for Chambers before going to Ohio. My understanding is that Chambers is upset about MBUSA for giving Moreno - or anyone else - the location. That's why his lawyer is making noise and veiled threats at the town."
2154,"May 30, 2015  5:07PM",flightnurse," No that is only on the 550i... I sort of laugh at the guys who beat their chest about owning one, then come to find out that the N63 engine has major problems, that can run up to 10K to fix (but BMW has stepped up and covered the cost with a retro fix.) Now the dealer has been replacing the battery in them too at each service.. This is why I believe the 535d is the best choice in the 5 series line up.."
2155,"May 30, 2015  5:10PM",qbrozen,"I'm all for packaging options, as long as it makes sense. I really don't want to deal with all individual options, especially on the used car market.  I actually think Honda has historically done a good job. DX, LX, EX, EX-L. Then just add Nav and/or RES. Of course, that wouldn't work with all the crazy things you can get on a luxo car. What Caddy did with the V Sport is definitely not the right way to go, though. 2 versions: Base or Luxury: $10k difference! But if you are the type of person that insists on a moonroof, then you have to pony up $10k to get it. That's just ridiculous.  The thing that REALLY bugs me is when they force you to get certain packages you might not want to get one that you do or lose other things you like. For example, when pricing a Macan, I found if you want the 14-way power seat, you HAVE to pay an additional $525 for the heated seats option (so why not just add that into the price of the 14-way seat to begin with?!) AND you lose the alacantra inserts, which I would very much prefer."
2156,"May 30, 2015  5:15PM",flightnurse," I ordered my E46, didn't on my 320i, we are ordering Ricks GT, as well as my next BMW. BMW last year 2014, did 22K European Delivery's at the Welt last year (this includes people from around the world, not just in the US.) that number is up from the previous year. BMW BMW does more European Delivery then MB and Audi. Of course BMW dealers really don't push this, as they too want instead sales, as well as the SA... But it appears more and more people are doing it. markcincinnati said:   In fact, our Audi dealer says that AoA's creation for the US market of Premium, Premium Plus and Prestige was created to ""simplify"" car buying (for who, the dealers? the customers?), by bundling options into groups that mirror what customers want.

2158,"May 30, 2015  5:53PM",dino001," It's all relative. In their home world they have more then twice of engine choices, with option numbers just mind-boggling. American price sheet for the 3-series is three or four pages, the one in Europe is a 30 page booklet. So, in fact, American ordering is very simplified when compared with other markets. It's of course reflected in the pricing. I also know they run a system with dealers in full control of the ordering options within allocations, as opposed to many other manufacturers, who often push their choice of options on dealers. This of course means that people like me, who have taste outside of the ""mainstream"" are still at mercy of Joe, the dealer's ordering manager, but at least they allow to order anything that's on the list."

2165,"May 19, 2015  8:59PM",markcincinnati," The issue is not so much the snow (coefficient of friction) but the things that happen to a ""summer performance"" tire when temps drop below 45F. So, while I could probably use and enjoy a summer tire in the summer (I had them on my 2009 A4), well, in the winter, the ride and handling characteristics of the car reminded me of ""driving on the rims."" The car exhibited what I call ""same day"" turning, and the ride and the sounds from the road were, for lack of a better term, ""brittle.""  We have moderate winters here in SW Ohio, moderate in terms of precipitation. But once it gets cold, it stays below 40 -- and, well, summer tires just become hard as a rock."

I don't know what being leased or not has to do with replacing tires -- when the OEM's go, well, you replace them (unless you are within a very short period of end of lease).  My 2009 had Dunlop MAX Performance 19"" 35 series tires on it. They had become substantially ""not fun"" any more at 11,000 miles -- and were said (to me) -- to be pretty much useless by 15,000. I had a blowout (when the outside temp was single digit above 0F) and the tread was so far gone I went ahead and bought 4 instead of the two I would have purchased had they not been those summer only MAX Performance tires. I had a 36 month lease on that one and, well, I was into the lease perhaps 9 months at that point.  When you gotta go, you gotta go.  I am considering keeping this S4 out of lease -- considering. In any case, for the next couple of years, I want the best -- most fun -- rubber I can have on the thing, all things considered.

2171,"May 20, 2015 11:51PM",markcincinnati," ""Normally?"" I'd say that the OEM tires may be good for anywhere between 12,000 and 36,000 miles. In the ELLPS class, often the tires are of the low profile, super sticky and stiff sidewall type which ""normally"" translates to relatively short tread wear. If you lease a German car, these days, it often comes with MAX performance summer only tires and those types have even less tread life since they offer very soft tread in the pursuit of high cornering forces.  SW Ohio leases are typically 36 to 39 months and 15K per year. No way you could keep the OEM tires on the car, at least if you wanted to enjoy the last 6 to 12 months of ""ownership.""  I have leased, now, almost three dozen cars in my life -- I have ONCE kept the OEM tires on for the entire lease -- I leased a 1996 Audi A6 (for one year) while I awaited my 1997 A8 to arrive.  Now, my friend on the other hand, turned in his leased car with the original oil still in it. He just added a quart or two every once in a while and changed the filter a couple of times. It was an Acura that he ended up trading in on a BMW. He did, however, replace the tires twice (he commuted between Detroit and Cincinnati).  Just to make sure I wasn't smokin' sumthin', I called my dealer and asked how many customers replace the tires on their leased cars -- his answer was ""all of them.""

A few relevant quotes:  With absolutely no feedback coming through its steering wheel, the 228i is a bear to manage at its limits with stability control off, first understeering considerably, then flinging itself sideways at inopportune moments.  ...more Buick than Bimmer. Every time we stop, the 228i's driver begs to get into something else.  The Mustang meanwhile, feels more like a BMW than the BMW.

The reason why GM was failing was the bean counter ran the company, it was cheaper to build one platform and have all brands use it, Caddy was dying because the generation who bought them where dying and people who had the money didn't want a front wheel drive Caddy that didn't drive well. That is why GM imported a Opal that could zig. Buick was dying for the same reason Caddy was, in the past 5 yrs both brands are enjoying a come back and I hope they continue, it only makes the competition better.  Chrysler (really Dodge) is doing the same thing, when MB bought them people were waiting for good things to come from that marriage, and it finally did the 300, but that was too late for MB, MB wanted Jeep and didn't care about everything else. Out of the that marriage MoPar got the independent suspension from the E class and their 5 spd transmission which made the 300 the success it was/is. Sure the Crossfire was an american version of the SLK.  I'm not too sure why you have to harp on GG, he has every right not to like Audi right now, allow him to do that.

For purposes of our discussions here, think of these distributors as your friendly local auto dealers.  I have come to learn that the distributors and suppliers have a love hate relationship. I must assume there is some similarity with auto mfgs and their retailers. Since I have been dealing with German car dealerships for the most part since 1977, my observation does not support this assumption. My Audi dealer seems to have a very positive relationship with Audi of America. My beverage alcohol customers seem to have no love lost relationship with their suppliers, however.  So, I do believe that my only matter of recourse, should I have an issue with my German car, is by dealing with my Audi dealer (at least first off). I have no issues with my dealership and we also had no issues with our three BMW's and the local BMW dealership. When something needed attending, the Audi and BMW dealership have always greased the skids, so to speak, to get the issue taken care of.  My few dalliances with American cars have, on the other hand, almost always had issues that the dealer wanted to get argumentative with. The same was true with Acura, but not with Infiniti. If someone says they have had issues with a GM or Chrysler car that required ""much"" effort to achieve resolution, well that seems, to me, to be justification for not patronizing American car dealerships. I've had the same experiences way back when I was in college and was trying to become a life-long Chrysler products customer.  My somewhat recent experience visiting a Chrysler/Jeep dealership in search of a new car, really did but one thing: I would, at this juncture, NEVER buy a Chrysler/Jeep product, as the experience made me feel the need for a shower -- and that was just going in for a test drive.  My preference is to work with what I have come to call ""horizontal"" car dealerships. The salespeople at such dealerships seem hell bent on discussing everything BUT the cars they presumably sell. Talk about zero pressure, zero stress, the German car reps seem, on a scale of 1 to 10 to place selling a car as number 11 on their list of things they want to do. One being the #1 thing they want to do.  Of course, the cynic in me assumes this could be part of a well studied act to make me believe they [the German dealership] really do care about what I want, rather than making a sale TODAY. In any case, I do respond to the negative pressure to buy. And, truth be told, I am not really all that concerned if this is all just contrived to manipulate me.  The guy I buy cars from is on my ""list"": you know the one that has a doctor, dentist, barber, accountant, lawyer, vet and a few other key individuals on it that we all rely on to keep us safe, sane, legal and well.  In my case, I happen to love German cars, Swiss watches, Italian shoes, and mostly Japanese electronics, and so on -- I have come to build relationships with folks who sell and support these products and services.  Nothing is perfect -- and I assume every product has lemons -- and because of this, I believe in relationships. If you buy into the notion that the stuff we buy we buy because of the service and support afforded us as consumers by the retailers, you should be shopping for the purveyor with as much care as you shop for the product itself.  My experiences -- after 33 Audis all from the same dealership -- have convinced me nothing else even comes close.  If you have an experience that you will -- on purpose -- repeat, I would urge you to at least consider doing so.  Most of the cars we discuss in this forum are more alike than not, if you find a great BMW or Cadillac dealership, I would urge you enjoy the benefits that you can glean via loyalty.  Finally, I'll leave you with this: one in a row is not a trend."

The A4 as we know it now will enjoy a SHORT model year (sort of).  The B9 A4 sales training (US) is scheduled for November with 2017 model cars arriving at dealers approximately in February of 2016.  My buddy at the Audi Connection here in Cincinnati showed me the email ""from corporate.""  The discounts on the 2016's will be, one would imagine, compelling -- how else will they be able to sell 'em?  Having said the above, the A4, even ""long in the tooth"" is a great place to spend miles and miles in. The S4 even more so -- with a bunch of incentives (my guess is the price will include a bunch of 'packages' in the Premium+ versions -- standard Nav, standard B&O, etc -- so for your $45K you may drive off in a $52K S4, which would be a helluva deal.)  Or perhaps for your $39K, you'll drive off in an all singing, all dancing loaded A4.  There will be those among you, however, that just won't be able to take the leap knowing that in some very few months later, the new and improved model will be for sale, meanwhile you've still got 42 months to go on your lease or note.

2222,"May  8, 2015 12:44PM",graphicguy,"I saw the BMW announcement yesterday with regards to the drivetrain bump in the ""new"" models. I always felt that the 6 cyl twin scroll turbo was uner rated to begin with. That said, I had the performance pack upgrade in mine, which according to BMW, upped the HP and torque ratings by about 20 each. So, not sure if they just applied those engine management changes to the current motor, or they did something more ""physical"" to massage the engine..  The thing that will haunt the 3/4 series is the continued interiors they design. You look at the ATS, the A4, the C300, and the BMW interior needs some serious rework. I liked mine (2011). But, it could have used a shot of style. Even with the new models, the interior could use more panache, especially considering what the competition is doing.  LD....my sister, who traded her 8 year old Jag in for a Mercedes was bemoaning not going back to Jaguar for her new car. She likes her Mercedes. She liked her old Jag more, though.

I can offer you a few pieces of advice. 1st, if you like the way the Legacy drives, then stay away from the Infiniti dealership. Just thinking about the 153 horsepower difference makes me want to head down to my local Infiniti dealer and see if I can trade in and break even on my Subaru (13K miles since 9/27/2015). Power from the Q40's 328hp V6 is plentiful while I'd describe my Legacy's power output adequate.  The Legacy will definitely be roomier inside. The interior is very well finished with high quality, soft touch materials everywhere. The legacy will ride smoother. I got my Legacy before the Eyesight was available. I originally wanted it the package is somewhat of a bargain at only $1200 or so, but I couldn't wait. I've also read that depending on your market, eyesight equipped cars are selling closer to sticker than non eyesight equipped cars. I really like the 18"" wheels on the Legacy Limited. I have cloth seats, but have driven a Legacy with leather and it was very nice."

2235,"May  8, 2015  5:19PM",markcincinnati," The above is the spirit and some of the actual words I wrote. Most of us have to make choices -- a new fill-in-the blank appliance, car, house, sofa, TV and so on. More important than ""things"" are the other choices we make -- perhaps it is children, college funds (for your kids or for your MBA or JD or whatever). The thing is very few of us can ""have it all."" And, even some who literally could have it all, don't want it all. My best friend worked hard at a manufacturing company and eventually became the president of the company -- he never, in his entire life, has owned a new car. He searches -- it seems like all the time, to me -- for the ""cherry"" car. He finds the mythical little old lady or little old man who has a 2005 Cadillac with 15,000 original miles on it and that's what he goes for. He is as passionate about cars -- subscribes to ALL of the magazines -- as I am. This guy knows chapter and verse specs about new cars, yet is always driving a car over 5 years old.  His ""settling"" on these rare cream puff cars allows him to spend lots of time on the west coast of Florida on a houseboat, sailing, fishing and sitting in the sun drinking a cold beer.  Whenever I get a new car, I take it to him and we go out for a long test drive -- with him behind the wheel. I can tell he loves the car and probably he hopes that when I get rid of it, he can be the next owner.  My wife and I work (long hours, typically), enjoy fine dining, wine, European travel and ELLPS cars. We probably could afford (that is the deal could be done) for an Audi RS7 ($120,000 MSRP). We'd have to settle on other things were we to go for the RS.  Instead we decided to set our sites on far less expensive cars (mine was $57K, hers $65K), we bought hers and leased mine. The burden for both is $1,400 per month, all in.  Our next door neighbor has a new 750 BMW -- and a Camry -- the Bimmer costs as much as both of our cars combined. The guy across the street has a Hyundai and a Yukon but also owns 1/5th of an airplane. We're all settling in our own ways. Cars are, for me, slowly, very slowly, beginning to be less important to me at 63 than they were when I was 50. My wife, oddly, seems to be picking up the slack -- wanting the highest HP she can get (within reason, of course).  Priorities, compromises -- settling."

Of course some people over on BF are splitting hairs on what the press release says. Not everybody wants those sport seats, so to force people to have them, would drive people away from BMW... One thing I'm waiting to see is how much is this new Premium package going to be, since it now comes with LED lights. LED lights on other BMW's is a $1900 option, and currently the price on a 328i is $3100. So $5K is very steep, and some people could careless about the LED's for $1900,,, I would have liked to see Xemon being standard on all BMW's, even the El Cheapo 320i.

Like you said GG, their world is about 8 blks from their apt, and the subway line in half a blk away, no need to really drive. They had their car from when they lived on Long Island, they have been in Manhattan now 8 yrs, and have put on about 12K miles on those 8 years.

I also have a concern about premium package pricing (and 340 as well, since premium pack features will be standard there). LED prices went down, but I'm sure BMW would like to keep the margins, if only let by the market. Seems like they're going away from HID lights altogether, for obvious reasons - green commies from Europe and America hate those, as they'd rather you poison yourself with mercury from CFL than use couple of kWh more; CFL doesn't work for headlights, so LEDs are next ""best"" thing).

There is, far as I know, no new ordering guide for 2016 A4's available yet.  But, this is the time of year, typically, that you can order a NEW A4 and what will arrive is the NEXT MY. Far as I know -- the operative phrase -- if you go into an Audi dealer and order up a new S4 Prestige with a bunch of options on it, what will arrive is a 2015 B8 version, not the eagerly anticipated B9 morphed model.  At the rate of change that is POSSIBLE, it would seem to me that an 8 year model to model cycle may now be too long. No wonder the A4 is selling poorly -- at this price point, folks want THE NEXT, not THE CURRENT, especially if the CURRENT is, literally, 8 years old, no matter how effective the mid-cycle refresh has been.  Now, I have had my 2014 about a year and a half. I have 25K miles on it. I love this car. I am thinking about replacing the tires thus enjoying the car for the next 35K miles with improved shoes.  I am hoping on a major evolution in the A4 model line as it goes from B8 to B9, and I guess the thing to do is to get the NEW version within the first 2 or 3 MY's into the -- apparent -- 8 year cycle.  I assume my current S4's durability is not in question -- thus far it has been bullet proof. I will be having the car ""rejuvinated"" at a local detail shop next week. I an assuming this process will do what the name suggests. And, I am looking forward to keeping the car beyond the end of its lease term.  Subsequently, I plan -- plans are nothing, planning is everything -- to buy the next time out, but who knows, things may change. Yet, I still assume I will have to order the car to my specs, but there's the fun, it's like getting a new car TWICE within 90 days.  And, BTW, someone wrote that cars on the lot are less expensive than ordered cars -- I guess there are exceptions to every ""rule"" -- but in my experience an ordered car is typically hundreds less than a car on the lot; and I've never had a dealer or dealer sales rep indicate anything other than a great willingness to take an order. My rep says he would be fine -- financially, I assume -- if everyone ordered and used the dealership for test drives; this way, he says, he could have more variety available for prospects to test drive.  I don't know anything about ""ordering"" Hondas, I would no more do that than I would order a new electric can opener, however. I'm partial to Oster's, if you care."
2255,"May  5, 2015  7:35PM",robr2,"I'm the one that wrote about VW's long product cycle. I have a B5 Passat. It was available for 1998 to 2005 - 8 model years with only a minor facelift in the 2001 model year. In today's competitive auto market, a car can't stay the same for that long.  Honda used to follow the 2 year minor facelift, 4 year major overhaul, 8 year new car. They have now stretched that to 3 and 6.  My understanding is that the 2016 Audi A4 B9 will be introduced in Frankfurt this September and will probably hit the US in early 2016.  I don't recall anyone saying it's cheaper to buy off the lot versus ordering. For the dealer principal/management, they would prefer you buy off the lot as they have an asset that is costing them money everyday. Just like any inventory intensive business, turning that inventory is key.  As for Hondas, your comment makes you seem a bit elitist. True, they aren't soul filled Teutonic machines with such tight tolerances that failure is inevitable . But they are fine automobiles that must be doing something right as they sell hundreds of thousands every year."

Some of us would rather drive Honda's and retire early than drive fancy-schmancy cars.  To each their own."
2257,"May  6, 2015 12:08AM",dino001," It's a ""wisdom"" often repeated in self-help books and websites, based on math of an individual unit cost (no financing cost), not considering overall inventory management economics and psychology of here and certain vs. future and maybe. It also ignores dealer cash incentives that are tied to inventory and taking a delivery in a specific time frame, usually within a month or less. No dealer would commit to a price reduced by a dealer's cash that expires in fifteen days for a car with 8-10 week lead, not eligible for that cash. The incentive may or may not be extended. This alone can put order in a thousand plus dollar disadvantage."
2258,"May  6, 2015  3:43AM",markcincinnati,"I have nothing against Hondas -- I did have an Acura TL SH-AWD for a time and thought it the Japanese S4 alternative.  Honda sells an incredible number of units per year -- they offer, apparently, a large number of customers and prospective customers what they want or what they are willing to settle for. That last declaration can be applied to Hondas and Acuras, VW's and Audis and Nissans and Infinitis and Toyotas and Lexus cars.  To some extent, we all settle.  My opinion, and it is a ""data point"" opinion, is that folks who go for Hondas instead of Acuras, etc, etc, settle more, probably, because they just aren't into cars that much. I work with folks who lease new Corollas every 24 months -- they proclaim in word and deed that their 8 mile per day round trip drive isn't worth getting a Lexus IS350 F-Sport AWD. They see no merit in cars, hoping instead for public transportation that would eliminate their ""need"" for a car altogether/ Across the hall is another ""cars are a necessary evil"" individual who is happy to buy a well worn but reliable mini-van opting instead for a new fridge, dishwasher, range and washer and dryer. We also have an empty nester two high income couple who love Acuras. The last player in our small group loves Minis and is as passionate about the brand as I am about Audis.  It takes all kinds.  I would not, on purpose, go to Honda for a new car -- I did dip my toe into Honda in 2012. The Accord line is nice -- but personally, I found it bland, uninvolving but well built with a smooth power train.  I am 63, at this point in my life I find myself repeating ""life's too short"" whenever I consider any purchase over some at the time appropriate sum.  Every appliance we have purchased -- if we settled too much -- fails quickly, either literally or in its utilitarian aspect. We bought three Whirlpool dishwashers (top of the line) and the damn things kept breaking (thankfully in their warranty period), then when they broke again out of warranty, the repair costs were often about 2/3rds the cost of a new dishwasher. Dishwasher number four was a Bosch -- the thing is a tank and is so quiet its damn near impossible to know if it is running or not.  The point is settle on the things that are not important to you, settle less and less on things that are important to you. If you are ""into"" (whatever that means to you) cars, you'll probably be compelled toward the ELLPS and LPS models many of us go on about here. If you'd rather have a new Viking range and a new Sub-zero fridge and so on, and aren't made of money, well your choice is much more clear -- go for the great stuff in the kitchen and the good stuff in the garage. I have no quarrel with that.  If you want a larger portfolio and are willing to drive something less than an LPS car, go for that.  Settle on the things you don't care about and don't settle on the things you do.  This is not the entire extent of what I have learned in 63 years, but it did, at the time (way back when) come to feel like an epiphany.  That is why I say: Drive it like you live..  So far, I do not have to settle on a Honda or a Toyota -- but it doesn't mean if you do that I don't respect your decision (unless you are ""over-settling"" -- you'll easily recognize this if you constantly complain about your new car or whatever)."
2259,"May  6, 2015 11:52AM",m6user,"Millions buy a Honda or Toyota because it is all they can afford, they are not ""settling"". It's hard for some to understand that it seems.  Some even aspire to same."
2260,"May  6, 2015  3:23PM",graphicguy,"I live near a Mercedes dealer in the county just north of the Greater Cincinnati area. As such, I receive mailings all the time from the dealer, given they captured my contact info when I was helping my sister buy a C class several months ago.  Knowing that the ""NEW"" C Class was on its way, I told her to hold on for 6-8 months to look at the ""all new"" 2015 C. But, everyone knew the new C was just around the corner, so the dealers and Mercedes were really aggressive pricewise in selling the '14s.  Anyway, got an email from one of the new sales people at the local Mercedes dealer that was obviously culled from my company's database showing what I'm sure is the only person who works for my company within a 250 mile area (probably bigger). They were having some private showing of a GTS. I ended up on the list to attend a ""look see"".  Clearly, they didn't have access to my salary info if they thought I was a target customer for the AMG GT-S. But, I had heard about it, read about it, thought it was ""cool"" so yeah....I'll eat free canapes if they let me sit in it. IF they let me drive it....even better.  I'll cut to the chase. They didn't let me drive it. Got to sit in it, though. I hate the new ""flat"" paint jobs these cars have. But, I guess the very high end cars are all getting them, Mercedes AMG is no exception.  Can't really see paying as much for a car as a starter home costs, but if you have the disposable income to do so, you'd probably be hard pressed to find a nicer car.  As I wandered from the hoard who was engulfing shrimp cocktail and pate, I spied a humble C-Class outside. Steel Grey with Red Leather (the real stuff....not the fake stuff Mercedes tries to tell you is ""better than leather"" (it's not). This wasn't the 400, but the lowly 300 with a turbo 4 cyl. Sales guy spots me, asks me what I thought. Told him I liked the color combo better than any I'd seen so far.  At the Autu Show this past winter, they were showing one that was black on black without the sport package....pretty dour. This one, was quite different. Very pretty. Sales guy has keys and a dealer tag before I knew he had left. ""Go for a spin?"".  ""I'm not in the market"".  Sales-""I'd rather take you for a test drive and hope you remember me when you are in the market.""  ""Fair enough"".  It's taken me awhile, but I've finally wrapped my head around sports sedans with 4 cyl. Actually, these turbo motors really do amaze me. They're torquey. More fuel efficient. Lighter. And generally, they may not be faster, but just more fun to drive than the recent 6 cyl cars I've had recently. Truth told, they're pretty damned quick in their own right.  This one is no different. I don't know the specs, but it's typical. No turbo lag that I could ascertain. Quick off the line. Pulled hard over a broad RPM range. It was quieter than the growl my CTS gives off (which I like). 7 speed trans that you have to goad a bit to downshift, but steering wheel paddles help with this. It's smoother than my CTS trans, but I've got one less gear and my trans is already pretty smooth already (GM KNOWS how to make a good automatic trans).  C Seats I really liked...even better than my ""go to"" sport seats in the TL SH AWD. The Benz felt tailored to me. I think most of that is due to the very soft leather (again, no hard ""pleather"") and the crazy amount of adjustments you can make to them....including power thigh extenders.  My CTS seems faster, but again, the C is no slouch. CTS suspension is geared more towards handling. C is geared more towards ride, but certainly could hold its own. At least that's the first impression over what was a 20 minute test drive.  Now, my CTS interior is no slouch in the build and materials category. Real wood, leather, suede, aluminum, is well put together, inside and out...probably the best GM has ever done with any car they've built........EVER!  C Class is over the top, especially at the price point. Again, real leather, aluminum and the switches were the same as I just had seen in the AMG just 30 minutes earlier. They felt the same, too. Mercedes leather is better than Cadillac leather, which is really good in and of itself. Porous wood, is better than CTS polished wood (which again, is really, really good).  I didn't like the new trend of the ""screen as an afterthought"". Cadillac does a much better job. I don't like the trans ""stalk"", but understand that's a Mercedes trade mark (really?). My CTS is bigger, but hte C felt more comfortable.  Final thoughts. The C stickered for right around $50K. Their discount, my corporate discount, probably put it somewhere in the $44K-$45K range. At that price? A very compelling car. The interior is what would sell it. It's competitive everywhere else...drive, handling, performance...with the 3, A, etc. ATS is edgier (as is my CTS).  Maintenance? Included with Cadillac for 4 years. Way cheaper than Mercedes after warranty period, too.  I'd consider one on my next pruchase...probably put it near the top."

2267,"May  7, 2015  3:49AM",markcincinnati," We all settle -- it doesn't mean it is a bad thing. And, most of us make choices -- the person who goes for the Honda is likely to be able to extend themselves to go for an Acura. They settle for the Honda because of priorities more important to them than having a ELLPS or LPS. Things like kids, houses, pets, home appliances compete for limited funds.  The family that has $50,000 to live on is little different from the family that has $100K to live on -- if you ask them, they will somehow tell you how they choose to live within their means (or they mortgage everything to the hilt, cars included).  I have lived with a relatively small income up to a ""middle class"" to ""upper middle class"" income -- at every way station, I have always felt I had to ""settle"" on something, either the cars or the home appliances or the monthly mortgage.  I am not suggesting that settling is somehow a bad thing. If one had a cushion of $10 million in the check book, I would assume it would be possible for that person to see virtually no barriers to a car purchase,  Personally, I couldn't see spending even $100K on a car, even with the financial impunity to do so.  I'll settle at this point for cars costing no more than a number beginning with a 6. In ten years, I assume the number will be smaller as my needs, like my hairline, continue to recede."
2268,"May  7, 2015 11:55AM",m6user,"You just don't get it.  I know we all ""settle"" or make compromises, but many people actually buy used cars until they can afford that shiny new Honda which they have wanted for years. And no, they can't afford an Acura.   Saying they can afford an Acura or maybe an Audi but have settled for a Honda makes assumptions that reflect a real disconnect.  Isn't it possible that some have ""settled"" in other areas just so they could buy their new Honda?"
2269,"May  7, 2015  1:07PM",graphicguy," Mark.....all good points.  I was just having this conversation with my best friend. He has a $70K '15 Corvette, that for the most part, sits in his garage gathering dust. He drives a new Suburban every 2 years....I'll assume those are at least in the $50K range with discounts...probably closer to $65K with the new version. His wife drives an Infiniti M something....assume mid $50s on that. So, in short, he has roughly $185K tied up in vehicles,,,,,,,RIGHT THIS MOMENT.  He's in my tax bracket. Not Soros money, nor even failed Silicon Valley start up money. But, enough that we're not too worried about going into a dealership and buying something like a brand new Corvette as an impulse buy.  His philosophy? Spend it all while alive and healthy. He has no kids. He was an only child. So, outside of his wife, he really has no other outlet to spend his money (or even save for college tuition, teen insurance rates, etc). In short, the only thing he has to worry about is staying relatively healthy.  Some worry and sweat every purchase, whether it's that new leather recliner, or whether to buy a Honda or an Acura. They have kids. They have huge tuition bills staring at them. I get that. I've been there.  I'm 10 years before I think about retirement. So, that's something I think about, but certainly doesn't occupy a lot of my time. I think I'm good, but who knows what will happen over the next decade.  Would it make a major financial lifestyle change if I bought a Z06 Corvette? Nope. The only question I'd ask myself is ""what else could you do with that money?""  I see my son, who has a good job in IT. He works for a major University, so his job is secure, probably as long as he wants to stay there. He's wanting a new WRX. He's fretting over how it will affect his lifestyle currently. As I told him, budget it up. If it would get in the way of your savings plan as it stands right now (I actually showed him how to budget for just about everything and anything), then don't do it. If you can do all the things you're doing now, put all the eggs in the baskets you've set up. then go for it.  Who I feel for are the folks who are busting their tails to make ends meet. Their budget is sliced so thin, that tomorrow is only a hope that they've got enough to feed their family healthily. If their 10 year old Caravan has a major issue, it will mean a large change in a lifestyle that can ill afford any negative changes and is begging for anything positive. They can't afford a new car (although dealers would love to get them in and finance them at their high rates). They're the ones who need a new car the most.  On the other end of that spectrum, there's my other colleague, who has a 12 year old TL....250K miles. We both get a healthy car allowance....BUT...only if the car is 3 years old or less and is on their ""list"" of approved vehicles. He bought the TL used a decade ago and is having fits about how much ""cars cost"" today. If he could drive a used Tercel and pocket the car allowance, he'd be happy. And yes, he can afford any car he wanted....including those $100K cars you speak about.  I fall in the middle. I like the nicer cars. but have my own definitions on what I'll spend money on. I like nice cars, but not ones that cost $60K (unless that $60K car was an overwhelming value at that price). I'll put a limit set at $55K. I've long given up the notion of any car as something that's anything more than an expense to me. It's a depreciating asset. Truthfully, it's not even an asset in my mind. Plain and simple, it's an expense."

2275,"May  7, 2015  5:26PM",robr2," You find that in many major cities. People don't own a car because they don't have to. Everything you need, including transportation is right outside your door. In NYC, you might consider having one if one lived in Brooklyn, Queens, or Staten Island. The further away from Manhattan, the more likely someone may own a car.  Here in Boston, they are encouraging NOT owning a car. The newest residential projects are expected to have limited parking and easy access to T stations, ZipCar locations, and Hubway bike sharing stalls. The newest neighborhood under redevelopment is the Seaport district. What was once a desolate area of piers with a couple of restaurants is now a vibrant area with offices, pharmaceutical labs, restaurants, shopping, apartments, museums, and a convention center.

2276,"May  7, 2015  5:26PM",dino001," It's not just that. It seems they are repackaging things.

They get Sport Line aesthetic features standard into 328 (SEATS!!!!), saddle brown now available across the board. There will also be track package, not really my thing, by I understand why some will go for it. I bet they'll still keep the sport suspension away from x-drive, unless you get the ""adaptive"" option.  I like the changes. I have no illusions on pricing, it will go up, but at least so will content. This is a typical mid-cycle refresh that adds value to a model. I'm sure 4-series GC will get it, too at some point, hopefully also in 2016, perhaps just a few months later. It will be between 440 GC and 328 wagon (I'm sure there is no 340 wagon coming). I bought my current as last year of the model, where some optional things were added to increase the appeal. Seems similar thing is happening again. The option schemes and packages was one of things I didn't care for in the new model. Now they gave me a reason to wait."

2282,"May  1, 2015  8:45PM",dino001," It's probably both, self-feeding feedback loop. Because dealers have large inventory and expensive infrastructure to support they will always prefer ""bird at hand"" (aka instant gratification), they push more for it. The consumers know it, so they adjust behavior accordingly. Of course then dealers claim ""it's what customers want"". The gratification of actually driving the car the same day and having the interest payment stopped helps, of course."
2283,"May  1, 2015  8:50PM",dino001," Honda and Acura are at least honest about it: some things simply don't even exist in their catalogs. I can deal with that - if it's not there, it's not there. The problem is, others (Toyota, Ford, Mazda) have myriad of combinations ""available"", but units on dealers' lots are ""what sells"" (understandable) and salespeople are not very receptive to order talk (not understandable). BMW and Benz will usually gladly take an order. It seems VW dealers stay more on the ""popular brand"" side, i.e. it's as Roadburner said, ""cold fusion"" difficult.  My other problem is, if not a single lot unit has certain type of option (like suspension) that is essential to the way the vehicle feels, how in the world can know whether or not I want it?"

They complain about Mexican or US made models and cars targeting at the American market. But they don't get the fact that a German car made in Germany is going to cost more.  The enthusiasts are worse. They complain about the lack of MK II Golf type car. They want the Polo to come to the US with a diesel, 5 sp, crank windows and no airbags. And they want it for $10K. They want the Bulli. They want the Amorak. They want the Caddy. Oh, and they will only buy them used.  The current US Passat is a fine car. The problem is that VW didn't bother to upgrade it every couple of years like the big Asian companies do. A manufacturer can't sell the same car for 8 years anymore with a minor facelift at year 5.  VW also has missed the boat on crossovers. They need a Tiguan replacement and a 7 seat crossover right now.

2291,"May  2, 2015  4:26PM",henryn,"  I remember, clearly, the first time a dealer sent me home in a new car the very day I signed the papers. It was in the evening, I was financing through my credit union, which of course wasn't open. I was like, ""How can you give me the keys and let me drive it home when you haven't been paid yet?""  And then there was the first time a dealer told me to take it home for the weekend, see if I liked it, bring it back on Monday (or sign the papers if I wanted to keep it).   ""The world has moved on"", as Steven King kept repeating in the Dark Tower series. The older I get, the more I like / appreciate / resemble those words."
2292,"May  2, 2015  4:30PM",robr2," The strong dollar does make exporting the Polo cheaper but would it be cheap enough? What happens when the dollar weakens and then VW is losing money on every Polo imported from Spain? Perhaps if the next Polo (MK VII) moves onto the MQB platform, then it can be made in the US or Mexico and be profitable."
2293,"May  2, 2015  4:30PM",henryn,"  ""The current US Passat is a fine car."" Yeah, maybe. But the 2008 Passat that I bought new back in 2008 was a much finer car. Much."
2294,"May  2, 2015  4:33PM",robr2,"  Honda has been well known for that since the 1980's. Honda is well committed to the minimal trim lines within a model and then options are dealer installed model. It seems to work for them just fine and in reality, I find that most people would rather have that than a dizzying array of options to choose from. Further, it makes driving it home today much easier."

But Honda has been this way for a long time, so not likely to change. Very efficient. And frankly, now that sticks are pretty much out of the mix, about the only issue is regarding the moonroof (mostly wanting leather, etc. without one). Other than that, you can get pretty much what you want."
2300,"May  3, 2015  2:09PM",robr2,"        So why not consider building the polo in Mexico?  Because it would require a dedicated line to build the Polo. It's on an older platform. In fact, VW sells the Vento in Mexico - a Polo based sedan. They import that from India."
2301,"May  3, 2015  2:10PM",robr2," If that were to actually happen, which we all now is highly doubtful, Honda might change - or they might not.  Buying cars of the lot goes back to the beginning of the auto industry."

Anything from EX-L up is limited in color too.. Not too sure what you mean by, "" you can get pretty much what you want."" In the domestic market you can order separate items, but the trick is finding a dealer that is willing to do it.

What I'm tired of (and I owned a Jetta in the late '80) is the ultra high cost of parts and even more so the poor dealer service network and poor reliability. High parts cost is ok if the experience of the car is good and they are reliable. So I really liked the late '90's/early 2000's VWs and nearly bought a Passat as it was much like my '90 Audi A4 - just a bit bigger but still almost as nice in size - practially an ELLPS. Fast forward to the later 200x's and the Passat is bigger, relatively cheaper, and softer. It's more like an American car but still poor reliability, expensive parts, and VW service network. That IMHO is why VW has missed the boat. And also agree that they are slow to respond."

2311,"April 28, 2015  4:39PM",markcincinnati," I did not say a ""million per year"" -- but that technicality was not really the point. The spirit of what I was saying was simply that cars, like houses, are very expensive purchases, yet we seem (to me, and I am only speaking for me) to buy these expensive durable goods with (what I perceive) not much discriminating thought put into the expenditure.  But, perhaps the system is set up that way -- folks go to the auto dealership thinking they want a dark blue metallic car with an ecru interior but, for the sake of -- what? -- expediency end up with gloss black paint and a light gray interior.  All I am saying (about myself) is I grew up in the 1960's when a brand new Chrysler Newport was under $4,000 -- which, for my parents, was a HUGE purchase. Since it (the 1963 Chrysler Newport) was my parent's first new car ever, they wanted (god knows why) seafoam metallic (a kind of medium green with a shiny tinge to it), automatic transmission, an AM radio with a rear seat speaker, a rear window defroster and power steering and power brakes. My parents thought (I assume) since they were ""spending a young fortune"" they should get exactly what they wanted, not necessarily just what was on the lot.  That mode of thinking stuck with me. Me -- not you, not other 'mericans, apparently.  My way is not correct for anyone else but me (but it might be, for all I know) -- it is, however, not incorrect.  Considering it would be less expensive if we ordered cars and considering that ordering a new car is almost the only way to get exactly the car you want, I simply struggle with the notion of ""test drive and buy today."" Clearly cars are bought in less than logical or even financially advantageous ways. Makes some sense, though, since cars are very emotional ""things"" -- or, better said, ""cars make US, emotional and irrational.""  Here's another ""shocking"" data point -- my friend who owns several car dealerships claims that less than 50% of people even bother to test drive a car anymore. I assume (doesn't make it so) this must have something to do with the age of the Internet.  I leave you as a product of my time -- which had its formative years in the '60's and '70's, apparently."

What he doesn't see, or account for, are customers testing first in any location, then going home, sending emails and setting up transaction with the best offer, which may not be the place they actually test drove."
2313,"April 28, 2015  5:10PM",markcincinnati,"dino -- good point, I would, however, say that his observation perhaps at least suggests folks don't test drive as much as they used to (or as much as my wife and I do NOW.) I'd say my wife and I are really oddballs, in that we test-drive new cars as serious hobby-ists. I like to think, however, we don't test drive cars we're pretty sure we'd NEVER buy. Of course there was that one test drive of a new Lincoln crossover, what were we thinking?

2315,"April 28, 2015  5:17PM",dino001,"Yeah, I'd like to test drive more than I do. But I'm too considerate of the dealer's business. I have a friend with no such limits. He goes and pretends to be interested in a new S-class just so he can ""experience"" it. Too me it's embarrassing, but he doesn't care. He always creates some fake justifications, how this pretending is not in conflict with his proclaimed christian faith (like ""I may be interested in this car in 20 years"", or equally ridiculous notion).

2318,"April 28, 2015  9:53PM",markcincinnati,"My wife and I certainly are regularly and frequently entertained by test driving. But there is actually a legitimate purpose too. Now, remember I said we -- broadly speaking -- don't test drive cars/SUV's that we are pretty certain we would NEVER buy. For instance, much as I might be entertained by driving a Corvette, I know in my heart of hearts I'd never buy one (even with your money). I just don't bother test driving them, therefore.  I have test driven an X6 -- and NOW, I know I wouldn't buy one, but at the time, it did seem like it was possible. Also test drove an Acura ZDX, for the money, it was better than the X6, but, for the money, I'd go with an MDX and pocket the $10,000. Likewise, I just CAN'T justify an Audi A7 or S7 when, since I have driven both, there is an A6 and S6 that are as far as I am concerned identical. Now, I do like the looks of an A7, but not $10,000 more than I like an A6, and so on.  I tested a couple of Jeeps (even the SRT 8 version) whilst we were shopping for the SQ5.  I can't see myself testing a Malibu -- just not interested, nothing against the car, per se, just not for me.  Same with a KIA Soul (is that spelled correctly?) -- but I would try (and have) an Optoma and am interested in a Genesis as a possible old-fart's alternative to an A6 for when I am 73, not 63, perhaps. And so forth.  I don't want to waste the dealer's time nor my time -- but test driving is both good education and good fun (or at least it can be both).  I'll not be testing a VW bug anytime soon, but I have tested the Toureg (and the Cayenne) and the Q7, too -- a VW CC sure is purty and in AWD trim could be #11 on my top 10, so to speak.  Within reason -- REASON -- I would think dealers need as many folks of means testing their cars as they can get their hands on. My wife and I test drove an Acadia a number of times -- came moderately close to moving on it, instead went with a 2011 FX35 (Infiniti).  If ""y'all"" want to comment with both an informed and entertained perspective on this forum, I would think that, plus your love and passion for cars would make you want to carve out at least one weekend every other month or so for test drive after test drive after test drive.  But, on the other hand, kids, in-laws, dogs and cats, broken pipes and blown A/C compressors can sometimes get in the way of the 'serious bidness' of test driving cars [for a living].

But we all know that American want that ""instant"" gratification, of walking into a dealer test drive, deal, and drive off with said car. Waiting 4-6 weeks is a life time to many Americans.

2326,"May  1, 2015  3:22PM",dino001," It's the same instant gratification. The salesman gets paid when he sells stuff today. The order is in the future. It can be canceled. The owner is paying for bunch of iron on their lot so this future order (that may be canceled) is not paying off any existing unit yet, but if you had bought today one out of those on the lot, the bank gets the check and interest stops. The system is absolutely geared toward here and now and the players adjusted to it. The benefit is lower prices, the drawback - limited selection and reliance on guesses from dealers' and regional reps' what will sell in what proportions. They essentially already decided for us what we want.  The German brand salespeople are usually well trained to accept orders and act like they're happy about it (even if they preferred to sell us something from the lot). Moreover, they generally have a system where every car has an order behind it (it usually is a sales manages, sometimes actual customer). They even have some ""special order"" options (like colors) that require actual end customer for production (managers sometimes create a virtual Joe Smith to work the system).  Try make an order at a Honda dealer - you get rolling eyes, laugh, dismissal, or even anger. Not to mention that Honda itself simply doesn't build ordered cars - it builds whatever it thinks will sell and then MAYBE you get lucky when one of those cars will be what you ordered. There is some chance, as they generally limit possible combinations.  BTW, those who make argument that order should be cheaper because it doesn't cost as much (no financing), it's true only in theory. In aggregate, all cars pay for the financing, including those that did not bear that direct cost. Also, if that logic was correct, a ""lot queen"" sitting there for months should have a premium sticker slapped onto it to cover that interest - but it's quite the opposite, isn't it? Because pricing decisions are only loosely linked to actual cost. The other parts are demand, psychology, planning, volume incentives, etc."
2327,"May  1, 2015  3:47PM",roadburner, Back in 2007 I was planning on buying a new GTI for my next HPDE instructor car; the local VW dealers acted like ordering a car was more difficult than achieving cold fusion so I walked and ended up with my MS3. A true blessing in disguise as I've since heard that the local VW dealers have a firm policy of refusing to hire service technicians with opposable thumbs...
2328,"May  1, 2015  3:54PM",dino001,"LOL, Roadburner. I think VW had one of the most inconsistent dealer networks out there. From absolutely horrible to first class and all in between. My observation is that it all depends on the parent corporation. If it belongs to a same place where premium German cars are sold, it's usually a very professional and nice place, not necessarily cheapest, but pleasant. Cross-pollination with fellow BMW or Audi usually helps. However, if it belongs to one of those Hyundai-Kia-Toyota-VW-fill-the-blank stores, the experience is not so great, probably for the same reason. Attitude toward order may be exact result of that - if company culture had already ordering on premium brands, it's no big deal to do that on lower end brand as well. However, if special order has never been on vocabulary of a Kia manager (not picking on them, just an example), when he moves to a VW store, he is not going to change his habits."

Then the US marketing decided they were going to make the cars bigger and softer and cheaper - just like a Toyota! Except that with Toyota you at least get inexpensive parts, a better service experience (usually) than the horrible and uneven VW experience, and much higher reliability! At the time I said that was a mistake, as why would you buy a Jetta turned Corolla when you could just buy a more reliable Corolla?

Same deal with ABS, the high zoot Germans had it long before the more pedestrian offerings, yes?  In any case, the statement that the customer makes the decision is one that I totally agree with.  Sunroofs must be more ""desirable"" even if they're rarely opened (like mine). I wouldn't miss a sunroof if it didn't come ""standard."" I'd take the sport diff in a heartbeat, instead."

2349,"April 27, 2015  8:26PM",markcincinnati,"If you delete the sunroof do you get a CREDIT?  I've seen some of the ""delete"" options, and while they allow it, they don't change the price.  I purchased an Audi 5000CS quattro some time ago (it had 15,000 miles on it). The window sticker was in the glove box -- the car had wool seats (with a delete leather seats, noted on the sticker). I liked the seats, even though I am not a fan of seats that cannot simply be wiped with a damp cloth -- but I bought the car previously owned, after all.  I assume wool seats must be the default in Europe, but this was not a gray market car -- it was a regular US spec 5000CS with pearl paint (optional) and delete leather seats (a no cost option).  Since sunroofs are only ""standard"" in some markets, I have to assume that the decision to include a sunroof in the US is the fact that we Americans want sunroofs and EXPECT them and perhaps would not like seeing a sunroof (which is a right, after all) with a line item with a charge on it on the window sticker.  I wonder if there is an economy of scale making the bundling of options for a particular market a way to both increase profits for the US (for instance) arm of the company and to somehow suggest that the content of the car is actually higher than competing models.  Friend of my wife just went test driving Audi and BMW. Configured two cars as close to identical as the web site configurators would allow; the BMW's MSRP rose more quickly than the Audi's, even though they seem to be comparable when ""stripped"" (which is due to the fact that the Audi has more content than the BMW in base form). Then the BMW surges past the Audi when the option boxes are checked off in an attempt to keep the cars as close as possible in terms of their equipment levels.  I don't know if anything was actually proven, but her friend ended up with a 2016 A6 3.0T Sline Prestige for about the same price as a 4-cylinder BMW 5 series with a couple fewer options. The BMW seemed to shoot up in price as the attempt to content it like the Prestige package moved forward.  But this may be an example that isn't typical -- maybe the BMW is comparable assuming you don't put ventilated seats, heads up display, sport package and LED headlights on it -- I find the configurators take a lot of work to pull together comparable equipment levels (and maybe that's the point.)  I tried doing this with a Porsche Macaan vs an Audi SQ5 -- the Porsche dealer said the differences in price for content were very small. My calculations came up with about a $15,000 difference. Maybe that is what Porsche figures is a small difference.  Hell, at these price points, price isn't really the main selling factor -- after all, if what we wanted was a lot of bang for our bucks, we'd all buy KIA's, yes?"

2354,"April 28, 2015  1:15PM",markcincinnati," According to my dealer rep, you can delete the sunroof on ordered vehicles. The thing is, however, the thought is you must pay to play when you order a car either in an unpopular color or with options deleted that will make the car, er, ""unmarketable.""  Increasingly, even the German cars are only purchased ""off the lot"" -- as we Americans seem to want immediate gratification -- so cars are ordered that the dealer feels confident will sell within some reasonable time frame, thus not incurring interest charges that are above the planned amount.  The off the lot mentality, too, is why so many cars in stock are black, gray, silver with black interiors, etc. We've apparently decided that we want our cars with black paint and black leather -- it is very difficult to find cars with more imaginative color combinations, or without certain packages.  I don't fault the dealers, though, car buying is: test drive and buy on Saturday and, if possible, drive it home on Saturday.  My wife's friend bought a very nice new car, about $70K before discount. A long Saturday test drive, followed by an offer, followed by a pick up on Monday. Wham bam, thank you m'am.  Now, the car in question looked like the Batmobile (well, sort of) and it is a very very nice ride. But, this method of picking out a $70K car seems like settling. I guess it is possible the car was configured EXACTLY as wanted, so ordering it was unnecessary.  But, why not take the time to ""build"" the car just like many of us build the houses we live in, the suits we wear, etc; and, then wait for the thing to be fabricated to your specifications?  Clearly, there is something wrong with me.  I am thinking that I purchased ONE new Audi off the lot and purchased one ""previously owned"" Audi (essentially off the lot, too) out of 32 of them. I kept the new one I bought off the lot for less than 12 months because it wasn't equipped to my liking. See, something's just not right with me.  The last time I was in Germany was 2005 -- at that time, the Audi dealer in Munich I spoke with said they keep no inventory other than cars for test drives because ""everyone"" orders their cars. Well, sure, I thought, you're in Munich -- but the same thing is true in Zurich. Folks decide to buy a car, work with a dealer rep to order the car, wait 4-6 weeks and pick it up -- getting EXACTLY the car they wanted. Is this still European practice?  Anyway, if you don't want a sunroof, order the damn car without it -- it's your money after all."
2355,"April 28, 2015  1:27PM",Michaell," Mark - interesting points you make. As a moderator here at Edmunds, I help folks with lease numbers (MF and residual). Often the question comes up about picking a car that is a good deal - I often reply with something along the lines of ""when you're looking at a $30K / $40K / $50K / $60K car, why wouldn't you get exactly what you want rather than what the dealer has on the lot?""  When we bought my wife's Outback in February, she wanted a specific color and option group. Fortunately, a local dealer had one coming in equipped exactly that way, so it was a fairly easy transaction. But, should I find myself in the market for a car with that price range, I'd have no problem ordering it to my exact specs."
2356,"April 28, 2015  1:45PM",stickguy,"Most people buy houses and suits off off the rack too. Like cars, the % of people that design, build and wait is pretty small.  Some people also buy because they need a car quickly. Others aren't that picky about ever option, as long as it looks good, and has the important stuff. Or with a Honda, they are all the same!"
2357,"April 28, 2015  2:05PM",dino001," Bingo. There is something in current American culture that prevents people from waiting for anything. That was not how the country was founded, but it is, how it evolved. Instant gratification is so entrenched that people would rather get a different color, no sunroof, or ugly (in their opinion) wheels rather than wait for what they actually want. One would think that products of such high value would be carefully selected and purchased to the specification of the customer, but the waiting seems almost ""unamerican"". I literally had to deal with blank stares and puzzled looks from all involved, from sales people, to coworkers, when I said I (want to or) ordered my car and it will come in couple of months. ""Why would you wait?"", they asked.  I think there is a strong feedback loop in this - people want an instant gratifications, so the dealers and manufacturers adjusted to that world view by taking large inventories of product (nowhere else in the world car dealers have such enormous inventory) - which in turn conditions them to attempt to push for sales of what they already have (financing cost of the inventory) rather some future product that may even get canceled. Sale can be really booked when when the product and funds changes hands, not when order is made and just a small deposit is made. The finality of spot delivery gives a lot of incentives to everybody involved to accept what is there, rather than what may be there. This of course creates sales people with blank stares and puzzled looks when they meet a ""pickey"" cutomer (like me), who wants an exact color, style and options and is willing to wait for it. Customers know that, too and they know their power of instant gratification works the other way, as well as their own. Unit taken off the lot today, is one with no more financing cost.  I always read that an ordered car should be less expensive than one from the lot, because it's not financed. This is true in theory, but the psychology works in exactly opposite direction. The sales people act like they're making you a favor by accepting a future order rather than taking the car from the lot (and for reasons stated above, they may even believe that), which means you should pay for that ""favor"". If you were more ""accommodating"" to their immediate needs (take one unit from the lot), they may be more ""accommodating"", too. As a result, some people who would be willing to wait hear they could get extra $1000 off the car on the lot (even if it doesn't make any sense from cost-plus point of view), so they adjust their expectation and take one with a different color or wrong options, just so they can believe they got a better deal. It even works for them long term, as such a customer, who bought a ""deal"" may be more willing to accelerate next purchase, as they may never get over that color, or those wrong options.  That's how the feedback loop closes - since people are willing to accept ""imperfect"" product, why change the business model that ""works""?"
2358,"April 28, 2015  2:23PM",robr2,"The vast majority of Americans want their new cars TODAY!! Waiting 6-12 weeks isn't the norm.  Now I decided to check out an Audi dealer in Birmingham UK. They have 174 Audis in stock and a total of 896 among it's 4 locations. I checked out a couple of Audi dealers in Frankfurt and Berlin. Each has about 100 new Audis in stock but when you do a search, it returns 5,790 new vehicles available - I'm guessing those are all the Audis in stock somewhere in Germany. A dealer in Paris has 37 vehicles in stock.  So even in oh so special Europe, it looks like it's easy to buy off the lot like a plebe.  My local dealer has 319 Audis in stock. Following is the color breakdown:  Gray 104 Black 93 Blue 49 White 34 Silver 31 Brown 5 Red 3"
2359,"April 28, 2015  2:33PM",dino001,"So even in oh so special Europe, it looks like it's easy to buy off the lot like a plebe.  It's all relative. Don't compare Birmingham to Paris How many dealerships and units are available in all five boroughs of New York City?  Europe has quadruple number of versions and options of same models sold in the US. 3-series had something like 4 gas and 4 diesel engines available, many options stand alone, etc. What here is a four-five page option sheet, there is a thirty-fifty page book. It costs over twice as much, of course. But I'm sure there is still plenty of inventories for those wanting one today. There may me more warehouses there, rather than actual dealers lots. It's quite common there to have a showroom downtown and off-site lot in commercial suburbs."
2360,"April 28, 2015  2:43PM",stickguy,"Also without ordering, many people still pick what they want. Just rpthrough dealer swaps or incoming allocations. So you can wait a few days at most and get pretty much anything.  I think this discussion is more about the small # of fanatics that obsess about certain things like a moonroof impacting COG. Or a stick shift! Very few people track their cars. Including BMW and audi buyers. So not many folks will wait 10 weeks to get a unit without a moonroof. They just keep the shade closed.  So outside of truly custom builds (off the menu). With all the inventory around, you can probably find 95% of anything in a few days."
2361,"April 28, 2015  2:50PM",m6user,"We do it because we can. Simple as history. If there were megalots of cars sitting on every corner in Euro cities they would be doing the same thing. They order because they have to. In Europe the car dealers probably took over the space where carriages were custom ordered. In the U.S., the car dealers just built facilities on the next 10 acre vacant lot in the suburbs. It's just a different way of doing things and for every anal car addict that posts here(and I don't mean that derogatorily) there are thousands of people who look at cars as transportation.....even those cars costing $70k. They just consider them just more luxurious transportation. I'm pretty sure cars a less expensive in the U.S. and people turn them over a lot quicker than they do in Europe on average. If I knew I was going to keep a new car 10-12 years and it cost me a lot more I may be a tad bit more picky too."
2362,"April 28, 2015  3:07PM",dino001," Depends. It may be true for some brands, where options and packages are limited. Not so much in BMW or Benz (even if their options are limited vs. Europe, they still come with plenty of available combinations). Probability of finding my favorite combination within 300 miles is basically null. I'd like 435i Grand Coupe with sport line (but not M-sport - ripoff, well let's say ""too expensive for value"") with red exterior, black upholstery w/ red stitching, dark burl walnut wood trim, premium package, technology package, driver assistance package, harman kardon sound (negotiable), but no lighting package (ripoff), I'm flexible on wheels. No. of cars within 300 mile - ZERO. There is nothing even close, like one option missing/too many. Even compromising on the color and/or upholstery and/or trim still does me no good. So no, ""pretty much anything"" does not apply. Sport line is rare, there may be one or two units per five local dealerships - of course in a completely wrong configuration. It just so happens that my perception of value seems to be completely different than sales managers of those dealerships. I see Sport line as a highest value, because it gives you seats and suspension without all that other fluff - and you get gorgeous red on black stitching (if you choose that color) to boot. They seem to think that if you want the suspension and seats, you must also want all those other aesthetic additions and accents that BMW charges you extra 2 grand. I disagree, but who am I?  Same thing, Benz - there may be 50 or 100 units in C-class on a local major dealer lot (TB Mercedes), yet ZERO (literally) with real leather, all that fake stuff. This is how it were at some point, anyway - perhaps today they have one, who knows. That's what people buy, they say. It may be true. Leather is expensive at Benz and the fake stuff looks ""just as good"" - so they say. I wouldn't know, as there isn't even a single one to inspect."
2363,"April 28, 2015  3:17PM",markcincinnati,"Good point about ordered cars costing less than on-the-lot cars. My wife ordered a 2005 and a 2008 BMW X3 and the sales rep was quick to inform her that an ordered car gets an immediate MSRP discount of $500 (maybe it was $300, I don't remember exactly) since the dealership won't have to pay ""floorplanning"" (a.k.a., interest) fees.  I've not even attempted to order an American car, although when I test drove a new CTS, I got the sense ""it would not be necessary,"" since ""anything"" could be found using the dealer locator software. I didn't pursue this path, so I don't know how accurate that statement was.  At my dealership, my salesrep claims he would rather send people out on test drives of the various models and then sign up new customers to order the exact cars they want. He says this is because so many of their cars are ""on allocation."" Apparently, this means you will allocated so many A7's (for instance) and that is it -- be guided accordingly. This excludes ""ordered"" cars.  The Audi leasing system devalues Prestige Audis residuals, so the dealers, knowing that the vast majority of the cars they sell will be leased, order in Premium Plus models which have higher residuals, hence lower monthly payments. My wife wanted (hold on) the heated cup holder in her 2014 SQ5 -- guess what? Only comes on the Prestige model (of course). The tracking headlights, too, Prestige only.  We got around the lease penalty by buying the car @ 2% APR -- no lease residual hit. I'm assuming, however, that the trade in value will be lower since the car has virtually everything on top of being a Prestige.  Here's another issue with the current American Way of buying: there is virtually no opportunity to experience certain options, since the dealer rarely stocks cars with (for example only) Blind Spot Monitoring or Top View Camera, etc. Also it is virtually impossible to find a car with sports seats in stock since ""sport seats"" only come on cars equipped with ""summer only"" tires and here in SW Ohio, no one wants summer tires, and so on.  The Munich dealer, on the other hand, seemed to have at least ONE of everything (to test, but not to buy) so that the customer could see it, feel it, hear it, experience it and drive it.  I'm not sure what ""oh so special Europe"" suggests, but it seems somewhat of a dis. I'm not saying the [apparent] ""European way"" should be adopted here in the US. Most folks seem happy with buying off the lot -- to each his/her own self be true --and the cars that I want can still be ordered exactly as I want them, so we do have a system that certainly seems like it's working.  As a further point of clarification, hundreds of thousands of people -- check that, millions of people -- build new houses (or they hire companies and contractors to do so). I realize that many of these built houses are from ""Home Building"" companies that offer customers ""The Pemberton,"" ""The Gladstone,"" and ""The Barrington"" (or some such names) that are floor-plans that allow some customization (kind of like a car). There are also custom ""Home Builders"" that will build it entirely your way. And, there are local builders who offer highly customizabel houses based on a couple dozen blueprints. Even those who do not build their houses from the dirt up typically shop until they find the facing and floor-plan that satisfies certain criteria. Some folks take months and months of house hunting before they pull the trigger on a $400,000 house, but will turn around and buy a $40,000 car after a 15 minute test drive (and they buy car after car after car the same way). Some folks probably spend more money on cars over a 20 to 30 year real estate mortgage term than they do on the house they call home -- always settling for what's on the lot.  What a world."
2364,"April 28, 2015  3:32PM",dino001,"It's not about Europe being ""Oh so special"". It's just a statement of fact that in the US we pay much less for cars, but in turn we have to accept limited choices provided by the manufacturers (like only 2 gas and 1 diesel engine on 3-series sedan, even less choice on other body styles, no manual transmissions, etc.), which is even more narrowed by dealers due them stocking only what they believe they can sell quickly - and customers wanting to drive away with the car at the day of the transaction, not in six weeks, not even in next day, or two. It's all part of the system, a tradeoff for significantly lower prices. Again, I don't blame them, just stating the fact. The reason of those systems evolving that way are many, some cultural, some geographic, some legal, some economic. In overall, I'll take lower prices for less choice every day of the week - but it doesn't prevent me from wishing there was more choice, at the same price, of course . But as a realist I know ain't gonna happen."
2365,"April 28, 2015  4:03PM",stickguy,"Dino, isn't the 4 GC by definition a rarity, so easily within the 5% margin? You are likely pretty unique in terms of what you want, so certainly should order. But that doesn't mean the majority of buyers aren't getting what they want by settling.  I guess though this is a board about higher end, more expensive cars. So out of the mainstream!  It also would suck if your car died, and you had to wait 12 weeks for a replacement."
2366,"April 28, 2015  4:05PM",m6user,"One, new home construction hasn't been over a million per year in years. It may be that someone actually pays more for cars than housing over a 30 year period but IMO it would be exceedingly rare. I pay more in real estate taxes alone than I pay for my present 3 vehicles per year. Equating a home purchase with a car purchase is apples to oranges at best. Americans can and probably should be ridiculed for many things but the way they buy cars should be way, way down the list."
2367,"April 28, 2015  4:16PM",dino001," Agreed on that one. Yes, it would suck, if the car died. However, the arrangements can be made, like buying a cheap car for time being (it is of course much more hassle, but I once almost did just that). I also think there are ways to prevent most of sudden deaths of vehicles, at least maintenance-related. An accident or act of nature with a total would be one that may not be fully preventable.  Another reason for European market being the way it is, stems from simple price-to-income relationship. Cost of a new car may be there in similar proportion to our cost of house. People buy and keep them for much longer, they cost more not just in dollars, but even more in relation to their earnings power. When you see that, it's easy to understand why somebody would get exactly what they want. If one trades cars every three years, there is always ""next time"" for the dream car, whatever it actually means."
2368,"April 28, 2015  4:24PM",robr2," Depends as you said. Local MB dealership has:  101 CLA Class in stock - 22 with leather 22% 109 C Class in stock - 38 with leather 35% 91 E Class in stock - 60 with leather 66% 986 Total in stock - 457 with leather 46%  Notice as the base price goes up, more leather in stock.  Dealers stock what people want. It's a $2300 upcharge for leather in the C300. That's 6%. I would guess that more than half of all C's are leased. The C300 leases at that magical price of $399 a month. Add another $50 a month for leather and it crosses that threshold where some folks start to get nervous."
2369,"April 28, 2015  4:26PM",dino001," That is exactly my experience, too. I had to go multiple times just to see how some of those trim colors look like in real life. Another example is dynamic handling package or 3/4-series. Sounds good, especially on X-drive cars that don't get sport suspension with their sport and M-sport lines. NOT A SINGLE unit available with that, across the board - 3-series, 4-series, sedan, coupe, whatever. ZERO. How do I spend, or not spend $1000, if I don't even know what it actually brings? The significance of this one is suspension can completely change ride experience, just like engine, or say type of drive, so it's quite important to know how it will act."

Answer: You take cars out and drive them.  I must admit, I wasn't all that keen on driving a dealer's car, especially since I know and they know and I know they know I know, that neither of us are currently in the market; but my sales rep, Greg, had a 2015 S5 with the Sport Differential option (and 60 miles on the OD) just sitting there, and, well, he knows my wife doesn't have any experience behind the wheel of an Audi S car with torque vectoring (TV). The rest as they say was inevitable.  We went out for a long drive on familiar twisty (and in great condition) secondary roads. I went first at my wife's insistence to somewhat demonstrate what rear torque vectoring added to a rear-biased (60%) AWD car equipped with max performance 35 series summer only tires can do, out of the box.  As I am familiar with the road where a sign indicating 15 MPH (right turn corner) is the correct speed, according to the Ohio DOT, to navigate the turn, I know my non-TV equipped S4 can take said curve @ 45 MPH. Therefore I assume that with the summer-only super sticky tires (I do not have these) and the TV option, the TV equipped car ought to be at least good for another 5 - 10 MPH without drama.  I was proven correct in that I easily took this ""curve"" at 54 MPH with help from what feels like it could be ""The Hand of God."" Entering the corner ""hot"" (but maintaining, NOT accelerating) was a little unnerving at first, but when I reached the apex of the corner, I dialed in about an inch more lock and a like amount of throttle.  The rear end of the car was seemingly grabbed by a giant foam rubber hand and the car ""carved"" right through he corner as if something or some one had gripped the rear quarter panels low to the ground and simply pushed me through the corner, virtually drama free. Speed? Yes? A bit of a rush coming out of the apex of the curve? Oh hell yes!  Next up a left hand curve with a bit of a an opposite (from the expected and helpful) bank meaning the car was not helped at all by the highway engineer's decision to have the apex of the curve have a crown rather than a scallop. Once again, almost counter-intuitively I entered the curve hot, waited for the apex where I cut the wheel to the left (a bit) while simultaneously punching the gas ""with feeling.""  Again, the invisible hand pushed the car, as if it were on rails, through the horribly under-engineered road.  A couple of nice, virtually deserted straight-a-ways where the supercharged engine at full throttle thrilled, rounded out the first half of the ""test.""  Up next, my wife -- our idea was this: I drove the outbound route and she would drive the return route, retracing my steps (in the opposite direction). My left curves were her rights, and so on.  Once she got the hang of cutting the wheel just a bit more than seemed ""natural"" at the apex and punching the gas, she too was calling TV the hand of god.  I guess, other than sharing this with y'all, I would invite you to experience a powerful car with rear biased torque split, aggressive summer tires and a ""sport differential."" Someone once said, ""nothing else even comes close.""  I am ""OK"" with not having a car equipped with torque vectoring -- but, given a choice, I will never get another car (on purpose) without it. The Acura's SH-AWD is a great piece of tech; but, the issue is: It is installed on a car with a 90%/10% f/r torque split and the ability to shift a maximum of power to the rear of just 50%.  So while I admire and recommend only getting an Acura equipped with SH-AWD, if you're looking at the brand, I can attest that, good as it is, nothing even comes close to the implementation of TV in the S5 I drove this weekend.  Too bad I'm not in the market -- for an S4 thusly equipped would be sick.  Drive it like you live.  Mark, reporting from somewhere in Cincinnati -"

2376,"April 23, 2015 10:26PM",flightnurse,"So this past week, the windshield cracked on the BMW, When I got home called the dealer to see what they charge, was quoted $635 for the Windshield, and seal, then labor at $172/hr x 3 hours ($516) for a total of $1,151.. Of course the service manager is telling me how important it is to have the window replaces at the BMW because as he put it, he has seen some horrible jobs which cost the owner thousands of dollars to repair.. We have gieco for insurance company, and have zero deductible, but they will only pay $40 an hour for labor.. So I contacted Safelite, my quote complete with a BMW windshield was $634, this they came to the house and replaced it. It was interesting to hear this guy talk, he and another guy only do high end cars and they are the ones who go the dealership and do them.. So the dealer was going to make $500 bucks by having someone else do the work...  So let you people know that Safelite can get OEM windshields and save some money and hassle, since they bill the insurance company direct..."
2377,"April 23, 2015 10:40PM",robr2,"Very true. Few dealerships have the ability to change a windshield. They just sub it out and mark up the price.  Even getting OEM glass isn't that simple. My understanding is that the OEM parts depots don't stock many windshields because of the time it takes to ship one via truck to the dealer. The aftermarket glass industry does such a good job and does it immediately that it's almost pointless for dealers to try and replace windshields.  I've had 3 windshields replaced, all by Safelite and IIRC, all the glass was Carlite who is a huge OEM and aftermarket auto glass company."
2378,"April 24, 2015 12:50AM",kyfdx,"I just caught a rock a couple of weeks ago... My BMW dealer actually does windshields, which I didn't know until I called them for a recommendation.  But, $1200 estimate vs. $600 for the local specialist... only about $200 of that can be attributed to the cost of the OEM windshield..  Just have a star right now, so I'm waiting to decide what to do.."

So I'm not too sure if that makes a difference or not but I wanted OEM glass installed."
2381,"April 24, 2015  3:28PM",roadburner,"My dealer's service department is one of the primary reason's that I've stayed with BMW as long as I have. My Service Advisor never tries to push unnecessary repairs or service and will tell me up front if a less expensive alternative is available. And, since my SA and a couple of the sales guys are HPDE junkies, I have never had a problem with warranty coverage on the cars I track."
2382,"April 24, 2015  5:07PM",sda,"  I often reflect nostalgically about cars I've had in the past. The driving dynamics, features, etc. of new cars have improved so drastically in the last decade that if I was to drive one of my old favorites today I bet I would be very disappointed. My current 13 Accord is faster than many V-8s I've owned, gets 30mpg plus and doesn't require frequent maintenance and has been trouble free at 38000mi. It is safer, full of modern tech features, a pleasure to own. A far cry from roll up windows and an AM radio!"
2383,"April 24, 2015  7:48PM",nyccarguy,"I know we've spoken at length here about modifying cars via ECU reflashes and such. Certain manufacturers are lobbying to make it illegal to modify your car's computer.  I have a friend with a 2012 X5 ///M & a 2013 ///M5. He's had both cars ""DINAN Chipped"" (as well as exhaust & suspension on the ///M5) and literally has nothing but problems with the cars. When they work, he LOVES the cars (and his wife's B7 X-Drive Alpina). But when he mashes the gas pedal trying to merge and gets a warning chime followed by a ""drive train malfunction"" message on his iDrive screen while his car goes into limp mode, he is less than thrilled."
2384,"April 24, 2015  8:17PM",markcincinnati,"There are ""chip"" providers that do provide a warranty -- far as I know, though, most of their products are NOT approved by the MFG's. Volvo has partnered with Polestar and cars chipped (from the factory, of course) by Polestar are covered by the OEM warranty. I don't know if Dinan has any formal relationship with BMW that somehow protects a customer with a Dinan modded BMW from financial ruin. I don't think StaSIS modded Audis carry an official Audi warranty, but cars so outfitted by StaSIS do have a full warranty and there are actual Audi dealers who retail from the ground up StaSIS outfitted versions.  I chipped an Audi TT (MTM chip) and sometimes under full throttle, the engine would just shut off, requiring the car to be restarted. It did this intermittently, and it wasn't until we decided to trade the car in on a more powerful TT that MTM came out with the ""software patch"" that cured this issue.  Chipping, initially, is an inexpensive way to get gobs of power (mostly torque) from blown engines -- but unless the chip's effects are 100% reliable and predictable, well, I am of the opinion that I will just get a bigger meaner more powerful version of the car in question, rather than trying to patch the OEM's software for engine management. Limp home mode is scary -- worse than that it can be unsafe.  I'll live with 333HP and 325 pound feet -- I know the next one will have more of both and get better mileage, too. Poor poor me -- how can I possibly have the power to pass safely on the highway with such a tiny power package?!?"
2385,"April 24, 2015  8:43PM",roadburner, That's very odd; I believe that Dinan uses piggyback tuners on those cars. I've run Dinan and Conforti chips in pre-OBDII Bimmers with no issues at all. The Hypertech tune for my MS3(when paired and calibrated for the Mazdaspeed CAI) boosted my power by 46 hp and also added 44 lb-ft of twist- @314 hp and 324 lb-ft of torque. No SES faults and no driveability issues- and fuel economy actually increased a bit. No regrets whatsoever.
2386,"April 24, 2015  9:37PM",flightnurse,"  Dinan and BMW work closely together, and if you have any Dinan work at an authorized Dinan shop, it is covered under the factory BMW warranty. My 330 had many Dinan upgrades to it and never had a problem. My piggy back on my 320 has been flawless, not one problem, no code issues. Now if I had a M5 and was having issues after upgrades, I would take those upgrades off and want my money back... No fun having a car like a M5 sitting in the shop.."
2387,"April 24, 2015 10:22PM",flightnurse,"  The other issue I have with Dinan is the price, Dinan just came out with a new line of Electronic tunes for the F cars, starting at a low price of $1500... My tune was $357.. The Dinan tune is to make 237hp for the El Cheapo 320i, the claim doesn't whether it is crank HP or RWP."
2388,"April 24, 2015 11:54PM",roadburner,"Dinan has always been the very high priced option; the Hypertech for my Mazda has a street price of $400. The Ford Racing power kit(tuner, plugs, cold air intake) for the Focus ST boosts torque by 90 lb-ft and preserves the factory warranty when installed by a dealer. It's only $795."
2389,"April 25, 2015  6:39AM",flightnurse," I agree they are pricey but I really think they are crazy expensive these days, I had about $8K of Dinan in my 330, which went pretty far.."
2390,"April 25, 2015  1:16PM",markcincinnati,"How is it that a power-plant that outputs, say, 250 pound feet BEFORE chipping and 340 AFTER not putting stress on the transmission originally designed for the original torque output (with some margin built in for durability)? The thing is, such upgrades of blown engines often do produce massive torque improvements (at low RPM's) -- and initially there usually does not appear to be any negative consequences of the added twist. But, over time, won't the transmission almost be expected to have a reduced lifespan?  My point would be ""let the buyer beware"" -- go with a factory approved chip provider, if one exists. If Dinan does not risk the warranty, go with them for your BMW upgrad; if APR has no affiliation with Audi, well, be guided accordingly and put about $15,000 in a bank account called ""Just In Case"" -- or just get the uprated model usually offered by the manufacturer in the first place.  This (the above) is coming from a been there done that perspective -- my wife was becoming a sitting duck everytime she attempted to merge with high speed traffic. We ended up just getting the high output version of the car -- shoulda gone with that one in the first place.  It continues to amaze me as I read the posts on Audiworld.com made by people who haven't even signed the papers for their new fill-in-the-blank Audi model -- usually titled ""Let the mods begin."" Folks are buying A4 SLines and immediately begin spending sometimes governmental sums in an attempt to turn their SLine A4's into S4's. Why not just buy an S4 in the first place -- about the same costs, sometimes less and no warranty risk.  Color me confused.  Nevertheless, drive it like you live."

If it had been a 3.6L TT, then different story.  But, as the review points out, it seems BMW is swapping places with the old Cadillac....getting softer, while the CTS is becoming more of an athlete in the group.  In truth, I think performance numbers for the 3.6L and the 2.0L for the CTS are just about equal. Some rags have the 3.6L a few ticks faster, some have the 2.0L a few ticks faster.

VW learned the that lesson the hard way; after receiving all sorts of accolades for the Mk I and Mk II GTI, the Mk III and Mk IV were hammered for being soft and uninvolving. VW found the plot again(as the Brits put it) with the Mk V and have not deviated off course with the Mk VI or Mk VII.  I know it is an overused concept, but when a successful automaker deviates from their core DNA, bad things will probably happen. In the case of BMW, the prevalent attitude is: ""Want a BMW that drives like a BMW? It's gonna cost you!""

Unfortunately, it seems that when one refers to the steering of a current BMW as being ""dumbed-down,"" the characterization is-sadly-literally quite accurate:  ...tuning the electric assist to provide more[feedback] is not that much of a challenge.

Audi seems to straddle the line a bit with it's regular A series, and cranks up the performance with the S and RS series.  Caddy is moving more towards the good handling/performing, well built sports sedans in addition to handing with the perennial ""cash cow) Escalade.  Acura, while I've always liked them, admittedly seemed to have been hit particularly hard by the crisis in Japan over the Tsunami and the subsequent nuclear reactor fall out. I think they're just now really recovering from that, Not sure why it's taken them so long to regroup vs their car manufacturing counter parts, but it has.  I've read that Honda is ready to jump back into the fray with Si type products. And, you can see some of that trickling into the Acura space with the NSX, upgraded ILX, and what I'm betting will be a TLX-S not too far out. They're already the ""wagon"" of choice umping the more upscale SUV shoppers.  Funny about BMW. I like them as well as any other brand I've owned. However, they do have a tendency to play the ""ready-fire-aim"" game. Take for instance the iDrive. When it first came out, it was terrible. BMW said we didn't understand it. That was part of the problem. They built an interface that no one understood. Now, we see them moving away from their ""core"" values as a car maker. They're getting further and further removed from the attributes that built them as a company.  They say we want ""numb"" steering....really? Who told them that? Their market research is WAY flawed. Yet, they carry on, trying to convince us the problem is with their customers, not their engineering.

For example, if shoppers who become buyers would buy ""whatever"" you can bet the supplier would provide as much ""whatever"" as possible.  I live in Cincinnati -- Cincinnati surrounds a city called Norwood. Norwood WAS the city that made Firebirds and Camaros. WAS the city. The folks that built the cars did such insane things as put pop bottles in the doors, assuring the cars would be delivered with rattles. Time and time again GM would give in to the workers demands for ""whatever"""" -- predictably and obviously, but not so to the folks who actually built the cars, GM said, to hell with it, and announced the closing of the plant. Millions of dollars of salary and taxes would come to an end. The response? The workers ""threatened"" productivity.  Too little, too late.  I bought and/or leased ONLY stick shift cars through 2003. I couldn't even take my car to a full service car wash, no one knew how to drive it -- once the noise and smell of my gears grinding and clutch melting was so terrifying, I decided, ""I'm done -- the basterds (spelled that way on purpose) have won.""  YOU are the reason the cars are as they are -- I bought nearly 30 manual transmission cars (from Germany, no less) the rest of you folks were buying auto transmissions. Now, after the plant's closing you threaten productivity? Too little too late.  Now, you're being told, I gather, that if you want what ever it is that you want, you can find it in an ""M"" BMW -- well, folks, if you don't buy them, you can be 100% certain whatever it is that you think you want will be discontinued due to a lack of paying customers.  The cars are as they are due to the market's acceptance (measured in BUYERS) of whatever it is they sell.  If they sell purple, green, red and blue and no one buys a blue one -- figure out what will happen to the availability of future blue ones.  You'd think this was some sort of plot against you -- foisted upon you by evil car manufacturers who only want to produce more and more car models and configurations that no one whats?!? Pull the other one.  I don't know what is being taught today at US universities that passes for economics, but it must not include the simple explanation of demand and supply.  Have you seen some of the car ads on TV? Some of them portray the company's cars being driven by handsome men and pretty women zooming off in the ""fill in the blank"" equipped with a stick shift. Clearly some cars with virtually nil up take on the cars marketed, still market the notion that folks lust for stick shifts (for example) -- where the rubber meets the road (where the cash changes hands) the transmissions are rarely manual.  Let's talk about the upcoming reality, more and more driver aids -- less and less driver involvement -- that is where everything is heading. The reason things are heading where ever it is they are heading is MONEY.  If you think we should have BMWs like they used to be decades ago, fine -- pony up the money.  Not gonna happen, not gonna happen.  I took a long test drive of an Audi S5 with the torque vectoring rear differential option and a DSG transmission -- Old School would be run over, chewed up and spit out by this . . . nothing old school, affordable by mere mortals, even comes close to this kind of performance.

I mean, the adjustable magnetic ride control on my CTS is generally regarded as superior in any comparison, so you can't be talking about suspension. I'd give the nod to the BMW sport seats, so maybe that is all you are referring to, although I can't imagine calling 2 cars in different leagues based on just that.  BTW, my CTS's TT 3.6 has far more power over a far wider band than the TT 3.0 in my 135i did."

2449,"April 15, 2015  3:59AM",roadburner," I fitted the 2.3 DI turbo in my MS3 with a low restriction MS intake as well as an extremely conservative ECU remap; while the N55 does produce appreciably more torque below 2800 rpm, from 2800 rpm to 6000 rpm the 2.3 cranks out 20 lb-ft to 44 lb-ft more torque. Which motor is ""best"" depends on one's personal preference. In my case, the 2.3 power curve fits both the car and my driving style- and with a 0-100 time in the mid twelves I can refer to the MS3 as ""quick"" with a reasonably straight face."
2450,"April 15, 2015  1:33PM",qbrozen,"  Well, certainly. But I can at least admit they are in the ""same league,"" sport pack or no."
2451,"April 15, 2015  2:17PM",qbrozen," My 135 was definitely fast, especially after I added the tune, downpipes, and intake. But the curve still wasn't as fat and flat as the Caddy's feels. For example, if I was in the wrong gear in the bimmer, it would just fall flat, while that doesn't seem to be the case in the CTS. Of course, an extra 20% of displacement probably has alot to do with that."
2452,"April 15, 2015  3:10PM",roadburner," Displacement is definitely a factor- and a flat torque curve plays to the strengths of the excellent automatic transmissions we have today. In my case, once you are above 40 mph or so any gear from 3rd through 6th will get the job done- the only difference is how fast. 3rd and 4th or the go-to gears if you want to make really rapid progress on a winding two lane road, but really you can just leave it in 6th from 50 mph-up and still have enough acceleration in reserve to humiliate most challengers.  I've been looking around for a manual CTS-V and they are certainly thin on the ground- good ones are, at any rate. I also wouldn't mind a G8 GXP with a stick, but most of those were bought and stored away by collectors"

2456,"April 15, 2015  5:31PM",graphicguy,"billy...no harm, no foul. I was not enamored with the 5 Series....especially for the price (low $60s). As far as one being nicer than the other? Can't really make that connection. I think the build and materials might actually be a little better in the CTS vs the 5. You don't see it that way. No problem for me. That's why they make all sorts of different cars, models at all kinds of price points. Plenty of choice for everyone.  I do like the 2.0 turbo motors that Cadillac, Audi and BMW use. I like the one in the Caddy a bit better than the other ones, though. INHU, it pulls stronger than the other two. My opinion is the CTS handles better, too. Cadillac really dialed in the suspension on the CTS.  Haven't driven the diesel in the E Class. So, I can't comment on it.  Now, if you ask me about the straight six twin scroll turbo with the performance package I had in my E92, then I'd be hard pressed to pick any of the other turbo 4s over that motor. But, you put that in a 5 Series and you're closing in on $70K.  I'd probably opt for a CTS-V (or even a less expensive CTS-VSport) for that kind of cash.

2460,"April 11, 2015  2:54PM",graphicguy," Mark...if I wasn't known for flipping cars every 2-3 years, I don't know that the CTS would have made it to my garage.  That said, the last GM product I owned was a Chevy Tahoe, which was well put together, uber reliable, and aside from fuel efficiency (which was at best, dismal) cheap to own and operate. But now, Tahoes are a $65-$75K step down from $80K Escalades, So, not sure I can say they're in any way shape or form, economical.  So, if I keep my CTS long enough, perhaps I can really see if GM and Cadillac have changed.  All that said, I mentioned a few months ago that I had tested an S3. Suspension was way too stuff for my tastes (a whole other level stiffer than my previous S4). Ran into one of the guys who originally helped me at the Audi dealership on the east side of town. He recognized me immediately (probably because of all the time spent at his dealership trying to get Audi to fix my car). It took me awhile to place him, but I knew him.  Kind of funny because I think at the time he was the Audi sales manager. He said he's doing something with one of the other dealerships in the dealer group. He was the ONLY one who at least tried to get Audi to swap me out of the troublesome S4, which they refused, preferringto irritate me even more and actually having to pay me to buy the car back. Go figure.  Anyway, he said he was starting at the dealer group's Porsche store next week. He wasnted to know what I was driving (didn't denegrate his Caddy competition saying he thought the CTS was a good looking car). Last day at Audi is today. Starts at Porsche on Monday.  I told him of my test drive of the S3 and that I found it way too stiff. He said he hears that a lot and blamed to high perforamnce summer tires. He said the dealership routinely swaps out the summer tires for high performance all weather tires, which makes a big difference on the ride.  He did have pics on his phone of a new S3 they have in stock that was gorgeous.....white metallic with black and grey leather interior. He said they just put all weather shoes on it and I should stop by for a test drive. He said he wanted to leave the Audi store on a bang.  Told him I was still stinging from my last go round with Audi. He didn't minimize my feelings stating he totally understood. But, he also said that was highly unusual.  Not in the market, but pretty day...might go for a drive."
2461,"April 11, 2015  7:01PM",graphicguy,"So, i actually gave the S3 another test drive. I usually don't go to any dealerships on a Saturday given they're busy and I'm not in the market. But, with the invite, I did.  Dealership had a couple of people in it, but not busy by any stretch.  Sales Manager I spoke to was there. He came over, shook my hand. Told me he was working a deal but got the keys for the S3 and told me to take it for a spin. He asked if I wanted his used car manager to look at my CTS....NO!!!!!!!!!  Onward...pretty car in the metallic white Still a bit cramped but felt a bit aierier than the IS350 I tests drove awhile ago. Ride is much better with the all seasons. Probably give up a little at the edges of handling, but the all season certainly would make the car more liveable on a day-to-day basis.  Seats are good, but not as good as the TL's or the CTS's. Not off by much, though. They were actually better looking than the ones I had in my previous S4. But, my S4 seats didn't have soft leather inserts, either.  Faster than my CTS by a good meadure, although the motor is still a 2.0 Turbo with more HP but less torque. Weight (less on the S3), gearing and the DSG trans are what I attribute that, too. But, the CTS is roomier. In truth, it felt about as fast as my S4.  Nice interior, as expected. Much less in the way of controls, especially on the console vs my S4. Not sure one is better than the other, just different. This one had the handwriting recognition. In my brief time with it, it was hit and miss. LCD Pollping up out of the dash is way cooler than the tacked on screen with Benz or BMW. I'm used to my CTS's interface and have mastered it. I have familiarity with the Audi MMI. Not much has changed from what I remember.  Handled well, rear danced a tad over some bumps, but it wasn't too bad. Never felt that in my S4, TL nor my CTS. LIke the CTS, lots of torque low. I like that. Not much is going to blow by you in the S3.  Steering was direct. I liked the steering wheel a lot, but I liked the one in the S4 a lot, too.  B&O stereo still trails the ELS in the TL and the (believe it or not) uplevel Bose in the CTS.  Stickered for nearly $49K. After a nice 30 minute run, I went back to the dealership, with only one customer taking delivery of an A6. SM asked how I liked it. I told him that for the money, I'd choose it over a 335i or C300. First, that kind of sticker will barely touch either of those cars. And, the S3 will outperform both.  He said he'd entice me by offering 5% off MSRP. Not in the market, and he knew I had an aversion to Audi.  But, if I still liked Audi, and I was in the market, that would be a helluva car for the money."
2462,"April 12, 2015 12:48PM",nyccarguy,"@graphicguy - nice write up. I sat in an S3 at the ny auto show last week and definitely liked it a lot. Just those seats & steering wheel (same with the VW Golf R) alone was enough for me to stroke my chin and start thinking... I also like the fact that one can go light on the options & have a car that stickers in the low - mid $40K range. I also like that the screen pops in and out. I can't stand the ""iPad glued to the dashboard look."" I'd also hate to think what that would cost to replace once the car is out of warranty;)  Kudos to your dealership for recognizing the problem with the car's ride & switching out the tires. What are the OEM tires anyway?"
2463,"April 12, 2015  2:07PM",markcincinnati,"Personal preference to be sure: the current Audi (and others) interior theme uses a pop-up screen that comes out of the dash and goes vertical when the car is started. The screen contains information I would consider to be desired at all times, so the screen is always up.  Years ago, Pioneer offered an after-market head unit that had a similar pop-up screen. My 2005, 2009 and 2014 Audis all have the screens integrated into a sweeping clean looking dash -- no clutter, no pop up screen that looks like something from a SEMA show.  In short, those pop-up screens look, to me, to be aftermarket, not well integrated and, indeed, somewhat fragile.  They are ALMOST a deal breaker. The prev gen Cadillac CTS (2012 for instance) had a much better pop-up in terms of integration.  My prediction, the pop up screens are going to go away (at least in Audis) within a year or two. Probably just the time I'll be back in the market, hoping that there is a new B9 S4.  Dealer noted to me yesterday: ""The A6 now has the S4 engine; and the S3 has equal to or better than acceleration numbers than the S4. . ."" ""Audi will not let this stand, if history is any guide -- the new S4 will bump both HP and Torque to improve performance over the S3 and to show better numbers vs the A6.""  Stay tuned.  The S3 has a ride that, to me, takes firm into the realm of harsh.  Of course one man's harsh is another man's firm -- perhaps that's what Audi Drive Select can address."
2464,"April 12, 2015  3:34PM",graphicguy,"Bradd...you know, I should have looked at the brand and model of tires, but didn't. Sorry!  Mark....the tires made a significant difference in ride. I don't think it had the torque vectoring either. It didn't rotate as well as my car, but ithat certainly shouldn't affect ride.  I should have played with Drive Select more, but didn't. As you say could/should make a difference in the ride, but don't know.  You're going to spend close to $60K to get that equipment level and performance out of a 335i. Not sure about what a C/CLA would cost to get to that level of performance."
2465,"April 13, 2015  3:35AM",roadburner," Just recently talked to a long time BMW enthusiast; he has always owned the latest and greatest M3 or M5- and even crewed on a BMW LSR attempt. He told me that he now drives a CTS Vsport. I asked him why and his answer was: ""The Ultimate Driving Machine has left the building."""
2466,"April 13, 2015  4:55AM",cdnpinhead,So I guess it's not just me.
2467,"April 13, 2015 12:43PM",dino001," That's a devastating statement from somebody who had been a fan and have spent high tens of thousands this often. My thinking is BMW doesn't feel the pinch now, because for one guy they lost, they gained couple of other customers who bought the nameplate and image, had no concept whatsoever what actual car sportiness really meant. The question is whether that sales surge is something permanent to enjoy, or temporary. One big value of enthusiasts is they provide free and most effective marketing. Many of those buying their cars today do so based on reputation built in the past, by guys like your buddy. It's hard to estimate how much that is worth, as some other people may also be turned off as well by the same enthusiast, perceiving them as juvenile snobs. It's clear that BMW has definitely lost the ""ultimate"" side for the sake of appeal to wider audience. We should see the long-term results of the move in ten-twenty years. As I recall, several other brands tried to pull that off and few succeeded.  BTW, I recall a car magazine review (don't remember which one) shortly after BMW and ATS came out. It was the 328 vs 2.0T. Reading it was almost Alice in Wonderland experience - they gave ATS higher score in most ""enthusiast"" related categories, from steering, to road feel, to some standard performance tests. Yet, 328 was still a ""overall winner"" and they really didn't explain why. My thought was they simply ""grandfathered"" it into top position and knocked out ATS on some creature comfort items (like that touch screen interface, they said was a four-letter word). In other words, ATS was an ultimate driving machine of the two, but 328 was better to own at the time - which I find plausible, but it was an ""enthusiast"" test."
2468,"April 13, 2015 12:47PM",robr2,  I'm guessing that BMW's monthly check was bumped up a bit.

2471,"April 13, 2015  3:36PM",graphicguy,"Ray....would love to hear your thoughts. BTW....how's the Charger doing? Every time I see one on the road, I think of yours."
2472,"April 13, 2015  4:34PM",rayainsw,"I like the V8 Charger a lot, thanks. No issues at almost 4,000 miles.  There is certainly much to like about the S3, for me. However, the price is quite high when well equipped, to me \ from my point of view.  For example: Although the motor is certainly a very good 4 cylinder, it is still a 4 cylinder – and does not really make the sort of sounds I associate with the price point. Ultimate acceleration is certainly acceptable, but I prefer more immediate torque delivery from low RPM. It does pull well, once RPM & boost climb. The DCT & final drive gearing requires much, MUCH higher RPM in top gear at cruising speeds than I prefer.  The interior rear view mirror is absurdly small.  The sunroof has only a mesh cover \ sunshade – not a solid one. Here in HotLanta, that is really not a good idea. . .  Although handling inspired confidence, I agree regarding the ride quality. Part of that may also be the S3’s relatively short wheelbase.  The interior materials seemed appropriately high quality, and the seats were comfortable and supportive. With full leather seating, I do appreciate the fact that cooling is available for those seats in the Charger – and it works really well!  I liked the fact that the S3’s center armrest adjusts up\down & fore\aft – a nice touch. I do prefer the nav screen being in the dash, instead of popping up above it.  Clearly, many of these are just a reflection of my own personal preferences. That’s all I recall – last drove one in December.  - Ray Quite happy with my current choice . . ."
2473,"April 13, 2015  4:42PM",nyccarguy,  Check the number and placement of BMW ads in that magazine & you'll find your answer.
2474,"April 13, 2015  5:43PM",Mr_Shiftright,"Well to be fair the ATS is a very slow seller, so the buying public is still hooked on BMW euphoria apparently. An ATS stays 138 days in dealer inventory."

The mags might not always be right but ""monthly checked was bumped""?  Please."
2476,"April 13, 2015  6:13PM",dino001," I read the same thing this weekend. Quite surprising, even for me - and I'm not a GM fan by any stretch of imagination. Another proof it takes so much more than just make a good product once. You have to do it again and again - and again. I guess if it took them four decades to destroy the company, it may take them twice as long to rebuild it - and only if the product quality remains up.  I wonder what kind of deals are out there. Or perhaps, GM reduced the incentives in some major way and buyers, used to them, refused to buy at near the list price. This happens sometimes. Midspring inventory glut is a bad sign - too far away for the ""all new"" model with a new rear spoiler and wheel package, all that metal eating the dealers' financing. Also, GM used to be notorious for overproducing and the doing fire sales. Old habits die hard? I really wonder why is it so bad for a product that ain't that bad at all. Perhaps it all comes down to price.  GM and Cadillac have chicken and egg problem, for sure. They want to be considered equal to the Germans, so they list price their cars accordingly. But because that's not the reality for now (at least in minds of the public), they have to concede on incentives - which perpetuates the situation. They could reduce the production, but the have to sell certain minimum volume to stay in business. It's a tough business, for sure. I think they need to overhaul their thinking in terms of not just product, but sales expectations, production, relationships with dealers, etc and model it more like those German guys. For example, BMW has quotas and allotments, but it's dealers, not the region, who decides on actual configurations within those allotments. There are (or at least used to be, when I got mine) reserved features (like some colors), which require a real customer order (in other words, those are special order only). I heard it's common for purchasing managers to fake customers to get those on their lot. I wonder if Cadillac dealers have similar system, or do they have to take whatever Detroit guys send them (I heard that was the case for lower-tier brands)."
2477,"April 13, 2015  6:16PM",dino001," I'm with you - it's really too easy to throw such an accusation, especially on a board like this. I wonder, if Joe Smith, a poster would say such a thing so quickly and loosely, under their name on camera on national television, so GM and C/D lawyers know where to send a complaint. If so, what would be a length of a legal disclaimer before or after such statement followed of course by another one from the station itself."
2478,"April 13, 2015  6:20PM",dino001,"I just looked at a random ATS incentive. They have 750 loyalty, but 1500 conquest cash. Way to go - tell your current customers they aren't as valuable, that you like these BMW owners more."

Currently, an A6 can be sort of had with sport seats, but, as I noted previously they are called Individual Contour Seats -- they seem to be a cross between the standard A6 seats and my S4 seats, plus massage and ventilation -- but the bolsters are not quite as prominent as in the S4.  I'm with those of you who consider the seats a deal breaker if they aren't what I want.  Most of the above cars that had sport seats that were optional came with a maximum price of $1,000 and a normal price of $500 -- even adjusted for inflation, I can't figure out why not offer the options that people want -- IF YOU ALREADY market them in other geographies.  I wondered for years what the big deal was about NOT offering heated REAR seats -- the cost of the seat warmers is probably quite low and a $250 - $500 up charge seems like a no-brainer. Finally, with respect to Audi at least, heated rear seats are at least offered for an extra charge.  I signed onto the Audi Exclusive web page, and there are many optional choices for interior treatments that can be had -- yet, it is clear it is very difficult to order sportier seats via that exclusive program if they are not normally offered in your market. The Audi Exclusive program seems more like a decorating option than a functional one -- not that that is a bad thing.  While I am ranting, I really don't get why so many things are bundled together into one mid-four-figure ""package"" -- if all I want is a top-view camera, it appears I have to take automatic cruise control, w/stop and start, lane keeping assistance and pre-sense plus. Now, I'd gladly buy top view and pre-sense plus, but paying for lane assist and cruise control with full-stop, start capabilities does not, today at least, interest me.  My belief is that folks do things based on what is marketed to them within certain cost parms.  I am not keen on paying for a seat massage function, when all I am after is bolstered chairs in the first place, so, I am likely to pass on the expensive option, and, without that option, I am likely to pass on the car and HOPE that the next gen A4 line will amp up both the L and the P.  I hope and pray that the explanation for all this bundling isn't to reduce the cost of certifying the cars for sale in the US -- stranger things, I imagine, though."

And, conventional wisdom at the time (read: The Europeans) scoffed at the idea that anyone would pay $20k for a Honda! I'm sure Acura's success further emboldened Toyota and Nissan to proceed with their plans to further humble the Germans..."
2506,"April 10, 2015  6:00PM",markcincinnati,""". . .to further humble the Germans . . ."" The word I honed in on was ""further,"" which would assume they had been previously humbled.  It would seem that everyone here appears to have an opinion that, to me, reads something like (speaking of the Germans): The way fill-in-the-blank"" (usually filled in with BMW) cars were during the fill-in-the-blank (usually some year or range of years that is at least 5 years ago, often as much as 15) is better than they are today. The author of said opinion/perspective will usually attribute their reasons for stating the ""fact"" of better then than now, to be the current difficulty in getting today's version with a stick shift or the increase in luxury content at the expense of performance, the selection by the manufacturer of run flat tires or whatever other dislike is currently popular.  Far as I can tell, however, the German auto makers Audi, BMW and Mercedes (and probably Porsche, but not as often mentioned) were not humbled THEN and therefore are highly unlikely to have been ""further"" humbled by Acura, Lexus and Infiniti.  Current auto review magazine's still typically pick a European over an Asian, and more to the point, typically pick a German over a Japanese. When there is a ""comparo"" report between the Japanese ELLPS or LPS and the offering from Germany (in the same class), the German's usually finish ahead of their Japanese rival (the one glaring example to the contrary is when the Lexus IS bested the BMW 3, and that was over a year ago).  Generally, the German examples rule the category -- far as I can tell if there is any humbling, it is the exception rather than the rule.  I so wanted to love the Q50 Infiniti (at the time I was in a 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD) and did end up ordering a IS 350 with the F-sport package when I thought I would be forced to ""settle"" for a Lexus to replace the Acura, thinking, at the time, an Audi will be too expensive to be considered, compared to the IS 350. I was mistaken -- an S4 was ""within reach.""  The point or better said, question, is, when were the Germans in humble mode and when were they further humbled by Lexus and Infiniti, to quote laurasdada's previous post?  Driving it like I live . . ."
2507,"April 10, 2015  7:00PM",dino001,"I don't know if they were better. I liked them more, for reasons you so eloquently stated. I would add the steering feedback as first and foremost reason. Then it will be followed by the usual laundry list, such as said RFTs, lack of manual transmission, or nicer sounding engine (pertains to lower end 3-series) and less expensive (which is true for all cars and brands). Now, that may not be ""better"", but I liked it more. Doesn't preclude me from buying it again for simple reason that others don't make what I like, either."
2508,"April 10, 2015  7:11PM",stickguy,"Well acura came out in 1985. Audi was pretty humbled back in those days. I'm still surprised that audi survived the dark era, never mind reinvented itself as a high end brand.  And circa 1990 when the Lexus LS arrived, MB was not doing sport. Big tanks and diesels mostly (exception being the SL, a convertible tank!).  To me, BMW is the only one that really evolved from the original ELLPS days, since the other euros weren't in it back then. To a large extent the 1st legend and Infiniti were it along with the 3 series."
2509,"April 10, 2015  7:25PM",andres3," Maybe, but I although I can't speak to the ILX (though the interior pics did make things looks less than luxurious), I can speak to the TLX with an extremely similar drive train; which I've test driven twice now.  I have to agree with her review for the most part though, and I'm a Honda fan. I think Acura is now overpriced, and/or underwhelming. The car feels slow, but maybe adequate, just not inspiring. The car handles nicely, but again, not inspiring. The interior is fine, but I remember preferring the TSX's interior. I much preferred the TL-SH-AWD models I test drove last year. For closer to $35K than $40K (sticker overpriced, but real deals were to be had), the TL SHAWD made a compelling case. For nearly the same money, the TLX does not IMHO.  I would say the car does everything pretty well, but anytime you give the car a compliment, I feel you have to put a qualifier like ""pretty or fairly"" before the words ""good and well"". No significant glaring weaknesses, but no real strengths either. I probably should have insisted on test driving the 3.5 V6 the second time, but I can't get over that you get an even more flawed transmission than the already flawed but improved at least 8 speed in the TLX.  I think I'd rather buy an Accord Sport model, and save/invest the money saved to buy a future true performance sedan."
2510,"April 10, 2015  7:31PM",markcincinnati,"dino - I guess I should add, too, that I don't actually know that the Japanese LPS brands have previously been humbled, either -- but I think (my opinion) they have, or at least they should be since they so frequently are NOT the winner in comparos in the BIG, IMPORTANT car magazines.  I saw MotorWeek on TV this week and the Lexus GS was tested (not compared), things went along nicely as the car was shown on the track and street -- and then WHAM! John Davis pretty much put the car in its place (which was to say, it was NOT at the top of the Premium car heap, based on comments about handling, braking, etc),  Yet, ""everyone"" I know who has a Lexus loves them -- of course whenever I ask why, the reason, THE reason, THE #1 REASON, the ONLY reason I can ever get out of them, is either how reliable or durable they are.  Odd, methinks, how I can't ever seem to elicit a comment about a Lexus, Infiniti or Acura that praises their performance, style, switchgear -- oh oh oh, I take it back, once, someone told me how good the sound system in his Acura is (and speaking as a previous Acura TL SH-AWD Advance owner, I agree -- Acura has the best sound systems for mere mortals -- the only one that is better is the hyper expensive B&O option Audi offers for $6,000+).  Don't get me wrong, a sound system is very important in a car -- but, you know, when someone tells me about their 5 series or their new Mercedes E or C, they tell me about the performance, ergonomics, 8-speed or 7-speed transmission, engine, responsiveness, cornering, etc, etc, etc.  My wife thinks that her Infiniti was great -- from a durability (and probably reliability) standpoint. But she ended up with an SQ5 (Audi) because ""Infiniti's ain't got no soul."" She was against my getting a 2014 IS 350 for the same reason -- told me, I'd be underwhelmed by it's appliance-like disposition.  I do appreciate, too, that I've read, here, the comments -- positive comments -- about the recent EL and LPS Cadillac offerings. And, well, they are hardly known as durable cars -- and no one I know who has one claims they got it thinking it would be the new world champion of longevity. OK, so here I am at age 63 -- I'm thinking I'm still gonna outlive any car I get, so I might as well get one that comes with passion, performance and pulchritude.  Got one more data point for you: when I used to have the Acura, I'd take it to the dealer for service and would talk to other customers about their reasons for being Acura owners. Now, get this -- the BEST answer I ever got was ""because I got a good deal."" Meanwhile, over at the quattro cafe (and the BMW store service area, too) the folks talk about how much fun their cars are to DRIVE.  Imagine that.  Oh, and, yes, I know, this proves nothing."
2511,"April 10, 2015  8:08PM",dino001,"To me Lexus has been traditionally perfect car for people who don't care about cars (don't get excited about them, don't want to know anything about how throttle or gears work, don't watch any motor sports, etc.), but need a car and want one that is going to be comfortable, well designed, high quality today and five years from now, reliable, low maintenance and yet tell everybody they have both money and taste. BTW, I remember one guy stating repeating couple of times low depreciation as a primary reason he got a Lexus. I have always bought a car for myself, not the next guy, but I understand his thinking - if all he wanted was to minimize the cost and maximize the content, Lexus was just perfect for him. Just like Toyota is perfect for the same kind of people with less money. BTW, this is probably 80% of the population, if not more.  I'm not looking down on those people, not at all - they have their busy lives, they don't need or want to know anything about weight distribution, cornering ability. I'm sure they have other passions that I could not care less about.  However, over time, Lexus noticed that they left that over 20% of those with means to buy their cars wouldn't even give them time of the day - so they change their product (a little) and advertising (a lot - most of their ads are about ""F"" lines even if they actually sell small fraction of those). BMW did the opposite - they have owned those 20% for decades - the 80% majority would stay away, unless the lease payment was right and even after then they would constantly complain about small back seat and ""harsh"" suspension, or road noise, tire wear, or all those things we know sporty cars do (including higher maintenance). So in order to grow, BMW changed their product (unlike Lexus, they changed it a lot). They don't really miss that 20%, because those guys still have nowhere else to go and all they can do is grumble. And judging from sales figures, BMW is now losing much sleep even if a few of them did go somewhere else."
2512,"April 10, 2015  8:09PM",markcincinnati," Whatever humbling happened to Audi it certainly was not at Acura's hand if that is what your comment suggests -- Audi was humbled because they were first maligned by a 60 Minutes story that made the preposterous claim that an Audi 5000's 5-cylinder engine could overpower its brakes (which it couldn't); then it was hobbled by its own hand because it was so ARROGANT it its response to the 60 Minutes piece (which Audi knew was false but didn't have the ability to see was the PERCEPTION the Minutes piece left the viewers with) that they said, American drivers are so ham-footed that they can't press the right pedal (or, the lie, that if you pressed both the accelerator and brake pedal of an Audi the engine was sooo powerful it would make the car lurch forward).  So, yes, Audi was humbled [perhaps] -- but NOT by Acura, Audi was humbled by Audi. Their reaction to the fake news of the day was what nearly done 'em in.  The Lexus LS may have -- in hindsight -- captured the buying public's eye for a ""cheaper"" and ""similar"" [to a Mercedes S, well, sorta] car -- today a top o' the line Lexus attracts shoppers for the reasons I noted, then, well, no one knew they were going to be so durable, but they were cheaper (but the Hyundai Equus is cheaper than an LS is today, too, though). Then, I don't recall that Lexus actually took too much out of Mercedes pockets. The only country Lexus was sold in was the US (OK, North America). Even today, a company like Audi sells 175,000 cars in the US (out of total sales of over 1.2M). So while we're important for the image (which is huge), we're not so much important in revenue -- and then, well, most folks couldn't even spell globalization.  I would think the Germans and the Japanese alike are always looking at the market, their direct competition, their indirect competition and what is looming on the horizon that could be trouble.  I assume they're all a bit concerned (too strong a word?) by the product coming out of Korea -- and even the American manufacturers are no longer to be ignored.  So, my retort is pretty much that Audi, not Acura was the cause of the dark days (with an honorable mention at least to the inaccurate 60 Minutes story Unintended Acceleration) for that brand -- and far as I can tell Audi's behavior could hardly have been more opposite to humble if it tried even harder.  Mercedes, even when they were somehow supposedly threatened by Lexus wasn't really put out much by the product, as much as they were put out by the hype -- and even so, the US (at that time) was still a pretty small peanut insofar as sales+image were concerned, compared with the rest of the planet's uptake of Mercs.  And, while I pretty much agree about BMW's -- a 1980's era BMW was still a bit of a rarity and were known for being ""breathtakingly expensive"" to maintain and god help you if you needed to repair one or take one to a body shop.  The folks I knew who knew or thought they knew about cars (remember I'm old enough to have been alive then) in the early '80's often would equate BMW's and Porsche's -- and some folks even had the gall (or ignorance) to tell me that BMW stood for British Motor Works.  I'm still of the mind that if anyone is doing any humbling, it's the Germans who be the ""humble -ers,"" not the ""humble -ees.""  Check out the new Car and Driver comparo (spoiler alert, the ""long in the tooth"" S5 kicks butt and takes names AGAIN! -- wonder how the Lexus fares? Hmmm?)  This needs to be updated (to include a Japanese stereotype and to relate it to cars):  ""Heaven is where the cooks are French, the police are British, the mechanics are German, the lovers are Italian and everything is organized by the Swiss.  Hell is where the cooks are British, the police are German, the mechanics are French, the lovers are Swiss, and everything is organized by the Italians.""  Any takers?"
2513,"April 10, 2015  8:10PM",andres3," I think you've hit the nail on the head. If I would have spent somewhere between $10 and $15K less on a TL-SH-AWD from my S4, I would have done so to save the money, get a better sound system, and perhaps enjoy legendary Acura reliability hassle free low cost maintenance ownership.  Ultimately I decided on the S4 because it looked better inside and out (style), drove faster, quicker, class leading transmission system, handled better/sharper/faster, the brakes felt better, the Quattro seemed superior to SH-AWD (less of a FWD with AWD on-demand type thing like Acura), and I could get it with contrasting Napa Leather interior (chose the Magma Red; beautiful). Also, I could choose Misano Red exterior whereas with Acura you have to settle with a purple looking red.  Lastly, I know the S4 is very easily tune-able, as I'm now driving an S4 that is as fast as an RS4 at 395-to 405 HP with just a simple REVO flash software tune. Your power varies based on the quality of gas and conditions like temperature. Get 93 or 100 octane gas and you can easily get to 410-415 HP. I do feel the difference. It is as if the car is doing what it was always meant to do now, performing the way the engine can perform without restrictions, limiters, & regulations being in its way! Without making concessions to the EPA, emissions, nannies, fuel economy, and insurance company charge rates (I think this is why Audi under rates the power in its cars), the S4 is a BEAST. I think 400 HP is a new magical number. Of course, 300 HP would suffice if the car was 500+ lbs. less.  Granted, if you don't have a heavy right foot, you can still keep the EPA happy with your gas mileage. I see no negative effects in daily driving. Just positive effects when you get into it!  I'm going to stop typing and try to find a revenue patrol-free road zone right now! Have a great weekend everyone!."

I'm a fan of the Euros, my first car memory is of Dad's Borgward and my Mom's Mercedes. My first car was a VW Scirocco. My last two cars have been Jags, likely fueled by memories of my Dad's friend's Jag E-Type convertible (and the fact that they are beautiful, fun and reliable cars!). But, I grew up during the era of fuel economy, hot hatches and the rapid ascent of Japanese cars. My father lusted after the BMW Bavaria, but friends that had them couldn't vouch for their reliability and he grew tired of the expensive repairs to the Mercedes and so they went Japanese (including a Datsun 260Z!).

The exterior is that loud red with a hint of orange that VW has had for years. It looks sharp in color but the styling is still very bland. The trunk is nicely carpeted and huge.  The interior is a sea of hard black plastic with touches of fake chrome. The only soft surfaces in the interior are the seats, the carpet, and the steering wheel. All else is hard as a rock - dash, side panels, center console. When started the engine made a horrendous sound in early idle but seemed much smoother at higher speeds. The steering is tight with good feedback. The freeway ride is ok but nothing outstanding. Compared to previous generation Jettas it is bigger and more chintzy.

But a new gen S4 may be a better performer, more fun and quicker through the twisties (and I am NOT speaking about ever tracking any of these). The fact that a new S4 ""nicely equipped"" can be had for under $60K is just a bonus.  My wife and I are ""60"" years old -- we have a Sheltie and we each have a job. We have no kids at home (other than the dog) and life is pretty much low stress, so we have time to indulge one of our hobbies, test driving cars. Having said that, I urge you to go to an Audi dealer and just sit in an S4 (or an S6) and enjoy the seats. I don't mean to persuade you to the Audi brand as much as I am trying to get us all on a level conversation field -- and that is this: good seats are the enemy of great seats. You may think your ""fill-in-th-blank"" prospective ELLPS or LPS car has good seats -- and it may be thus. You may actually find better seats than Audi deems fit to put in its S cars -- and if you do, for god's sake please share. And, I'm already pretty much a fan of Volvo seats and Porsche seats, so those don't need to be discussed.  My point is, if you don't have to find a sitter or arrange your schedules to spend your weekends driving cars, take a detour to the showroom noted and try the S4's seats out.  Were I able to check a box and make these seats available across the ELLPS and LPS universe, I would. Who knows, were seats this good available from several manufacturers, perhaps I could see myself driving another brand.  Of course, if you want, you could even test drive the car to see how great seats make driving all that much more fun.  Remember good seats are the enemy of great seats."
2520,"April  8, 2015  2:30PM",roadburner," The base seats in my wife's E36, E39, and E83 were fine for all but ""brisk"" driving; the E90 base seats are more like park benches. In Europe the sport seats are a standalone option, but in the US you have to get the Sport/M Sport package. Fine for me, but my wife doesn't want/need the staggered summer rubber or the M Sport suspension(which admittedly feels a bit brittle with RFTs)."
2521,"April  8, 2015  4:27PM",dino001," I'd go further - the base seats are proof that majority of 3-series and 4-series buyers are there for the badge. I said repeatedly to salesmen that those seats are deal breakers to me. many of them totally agree that those standard seats are true disgrace. I'll admit that F3x standard seats are improved over E9x standard seats, but still way in a different neighborhood of off what a ""sports sedan"" should have as standard. I simply can't believe they have been selling this crap for this long with no signs of change. What's worse - you can't even get their sports seats on ""Luxury"" line, even as a stand-alone option. That is truly pathetic. Now I hear Audi has gone same way? The world is ending, no doubt."
2522,"April  8, 2015  4:36PM",dino001,"I always made fun at American manufacturers that they had no clue how to make a decent car seat. It was a clear cultural thing - for too long the mainstream here believed that a car seat should look like a couch: flat, unbolstered bench with supersoft, but short cushions and non-adjustable low head restraints (aka neck breakers) was the ""good seat"". Just a look at an old Chevy, Buick, or Ford (GM was the worst though, hands down) made my back and neck hurt. Seems American public learned since then and so did the manufacturers.  However, Germans have always known how to make good car seats. They just don't care enough to give us one in their base price, which is inexcusable, IMHO.  As I keep owning my BMW and really like it, I became quite disgruntled with the way they market and price their product. Not so much about the pricing level (because in comparison to Europe and other markets we have it really good here), but the sneaky way they put the content together and sometimes truly embarrassing configurations. Besides the front seats, my other ""favorite"" is fold-down seats, which used to be $500 option on previous generations and still remains one on 320 line (now standard on 328/335). What was worse, majority of dealers appear to be oblivious to that and ordered cars without them, so I am absolutely positive there were plenty of people shocked to learn their ""luxury"" car lacked a feature standard on the cheapest vehicle sold in the country."
2523,"April  8, 2015  4:38PM",dino001," I believe there is an option for all-season non-staggered tires with Sport/M-Sport package. I don't know if dealers order them, but it is possible to order. You can also get a ""normal"" suspension with those, just get x-drive (in this case, Sport/M Sport turns into pure aesthetic package plus seats). To get sport suspension with x-drive, you need to pony up another $1000 for their adaptive M-sport stuff. So there is a way to get good seats without firm suspension."
2524,"April  8, 2015  5:46PM",laurasdada,"The standard seats in the XF are pretty good. While not ""Sport"" seats, I feel they lean in that direction with decent bolstering on the sides and the seat itself. The ""Bonded"" leather can be a bit slippery, but I stay pretty much in place when the road curves. I really wish the seat bottom had thigh support/adjustments though. I find the cushion just a hair short and I'd prefer more support/adjustment. The XK had the multiple adjustable seats, everything was adjustable. Fabulous. I would have had to have sprung for the $4k Portfolio pkg. in the XF to get those seats, the only option my XF does not have.  Looking forward to the coming years when y'all are writing about how great your new XEs and XFs are!"
2525,"April  8, 2015  5:53PM",andres3," Buick's reputation for being more reliable than other GM cars may have been severely tarnished by someone actually letting the RPM gauge go past 3K or pushing the throttle past 33%.  I'd of been worried about needing a Hertz tow truck. Of course, I've talked about a previous Camaro requiring a new transmission before the weekend was out. They conveniently towed his car off the track and put it next to the adjacent public highway before the ""Hertz"" tow truck got there; to avoid any possible confrontations about why the car broke down. I read all the fine print in Hertz's contract, and it doesn't specifically exclude HPDE's."
2526,"April  8, 2015  6:00PM",andres3," I'd for certain argue about safety, as if I'm killed in a Kia Rio rental I'd of likely survived in an Audi S4. I'd leave instructions for my heirs to sue for everything Hertz and the at-fault party were worth (driver and insurance that directly caused the rental in the first place). I'm certainly honestly concerned about safety, as I hope the **** never hits the fan, but you never know.  You could argue you take trips to the mountains, maybe go on dirt or snowy roads, so you have to have AWD. You could argue you need the creature comforts of a premium car, the nice sound system, and other features you enjoy. There's a reason someone buys a luxury sport vehicle, and you can't just replace it with an old Chevy Impala rental because it's as big or bigger and has 4-doors.  As to being insured for HPDE events, as of about a year ago, Geico specifically has made an effort to exclude it in the policy. However, you wouldn't be suing for insurance coverage while your at the track, you'd be suing for ""loss of use,"" as very few cars are track-suitable, or as fun to drive as an S4. I think it's two entirely different concepts. It's equivalent to if your house burns down and you have (loss of use housing coverage) putting you in a 4,000 SF mansion in El Centro, CA, instead of La Jolla, CA. Equivalent to insurance companies, but not anyone else that lives in the real world."
2527,"April  8, 2015  6:11PM",andres3, assuming the Dodge doesn't break down before the weekend's out......

2529,"April  8, 2015  6:32PM",Michaell," ...by putting him into a Hellcat or an SRT 392 for the weekend.  Heck, RB, if you can make the switch from BMW to Chrysler, I think everyone could!"
2530,"April  8, 2015  6:57PM",nyccarguy," Every single manufacturer has gone through significant changes (for better or worse) since the mid-90's when you owned your Neon. In fact, if things hadn't changed I'd be right there with you. My first car was a 1992 Chevrolet Beretta GT (bought brand new) which had a myriad of problems that concluded with the loeb of the camshaft (2nd from the top) completely wearing down at 61K miles. For years I swore off GM and Domestics in general. I'm sure I even vowed at one point (most likely on these boards) to never set foot in a D3 dealership again. Durability and reliability have increased tremendously across the board. Horsepower numbers are up (and so is weight). Significant weight loss seems to be the next trend. Each manufacturer does make a performance oriented car that given proper modifications will perform very well at the track. There are very few cars out there that are ""no compromise."""
2531,"April  8, 2015  7:25PM",robr2, The part that bugs me the most is that it wasn't even his car. It was his parents'. I figure his grandkids will be the ones to give up the grudge.
2532,"April  8, 2015  7:28PM",tlong," I would rather buy a Mazda 3, fully loaded, for under $30K and have better reliability and a good seat at a reasonable price.  I used to have exactly the same impressions of American vs. German car seats. It looks like the Germans are pandering to the mainstream US tastes and then getting a good seat is another way to nickel and dime those already high prices into higher prices. VW tried to pander to the US tastes with their blandmobiles like the current Jetta and the bloated Passat - and they have fully lost my interest on any of their models."
2533,"April  8, 2015  7:36PM",roadburner,I'll just pour more fuel on the fire; my wife liked the seats in the Fiat 500 Pop we rented better than the E90's seats. Ditto for the chairs in my 1999 Wrangler Sahara.
2534,"April  8, 2015  9:23PM",graphicguy,"Heck...if I can get over my Cadillac aversion, anyone can get over whatever prejudice with any car model/company."
2535,"April  8, 2015 11:10PM",markcincinnati,"Seat update: there is an Audi A6 (not S6, A6) seat option that does, mostly, mitigate my complaints about the flat, slick bucket seats that are standard equipment.  The option is called Individual Contour Seating Package. Please sit down.  It is $3,450.00.  Shut the front door.  Now, the seating package includes magic finger massage and full gender specif catheterization so you never have stop for those pesky bathroom breaks on those long 400 mile stints where there are no bathrooms.  The seats ARE very very nice -- I was hoping for something in the $1,000 range tho . . .  Of course there's always the $20,000 S6 upgrade which comes with the good seats, standard.  Decisions, decisions.  Oh yea, it also comes with stints. Whatever that means."
2536,"April  9, 2015  1:53AM",cdnpinhead," Now that is nicely put.  As I drive my lowly pre-beak TSX, it's interesting to hear my betters discuss this sort of stuff.  Some do it better than others."

2539,"April  9, 2015  2:48AM",andres3,"Case in point, again: The loaner Audi S4 (@$52,200) I have today doesn't have a backup camera, park assist or bluetooth iphone audio integration-- who, in the wide, wide world of sports would spend (or expect to spend) that kind of cheese and not get a backup camera, etc? If my maximum spending ability prevented me from having these ""essentials,"" I assure you I would not look at a German, I'd go Asian or American and probably not be looking at the ELLPS class. Hyundai Genesis anyone?  Since when did ""backup camera's"" become essential equipment? I would say just 5 years ago they were still rarely seen. What the heck is park assist? I can park my own car. People did just fine without back up cameras for decades upon decades; it is far from essential. I got a red S4 without the back up cam and overpriced MMI/navigation, but I do have IPhone Bluetooth integration; perhaps the setup is different without MMI and you didn't know?  Cars are getting more and more expensive, and I believe it is because of all the non-essential ""so-called essentials."" The essentials are getting from A to B reliably. Being a ELPS category means that the L and P are important. My taste prefers my money go more towards P."
2540,"April  9, 2015  2:52AM",andres3," It's not just the Neon that was a bad model, take a look at Calibers, PT Cruisers, Darts (problems in Edmunds' own long term tester) Stratus', Cirrus', Pacifica's, and more.  Hence Chrysler still lives in the basement of CR's reliability rankings (including more recent models/renamed old models); the more you think things have changed, the more they really remain the same."
2541,"April  9, 2015  2:57AM",andres3," First of all, it was a shared car; meaning it wasn't just my Parents'. It was shared ownership. Second of all, have things more than name changes really changed? Neon = PT Cruiser = Caliber = Dart. Yes, lots of name changes, but have the head gaskets and AC compressors improved? Yes, they have more than 3 automatic gears now, but has reliability increased? They still sit at the bottom of any credible source on reliability."
2542,"April  9, 2015  3:04AM",andres3," The jury is still out with your Cadillac though. Let's see if your aversion returns by the time you get to say.... 65,000 miles. Again, Edmunds' long term testers just a few years ago from Cadillac had parts flying/falling off, rattling, coming apart, and generally unacceptable problems."
2543,"April  9, 2015  3:09AM",andres3,"I think the Neon experience was so bad that I have no patience left in this lifetime for an unreliable car. Another unreliable car would quickly vanish from my possession. I am risk averse to unreliable possibilities.  Honda and Audi were not perfect experiences for me, but the fact they stood behind their product and either paid for repairs or reimbursed me for repairs (even if technically after warranty period) went a long way towards gaining my trust."
2544,"April  9, 2015  4:20AM",andres3," I would add more refined sport suspension, possibly better summer tires (not sure on that one; check to see if they are the same size tire too), more quality control which leads to far better reliability, durability, less warranty hassles, far improved interior, improved materials AND fit & finish/build quality, longer warranty? free loaners if you need a warranty trip, more std. equipment (?), better seats, improved looks (subjective), more color selection, more option choices, and different trim level configurations whereas the GLI is pretty much you get what you get.  A lot of my knowledge on this is from comparing the vast and varied superiorities of the '06 A3 to the same year GTI. Also back then you got free maintenance for 50K miles. I would say the '15 GTI has caught up to my old A3 in most ways.  I'm a classic example of purchasing an entry level luxury car, having a great experience, and moving from $30K for the A3 to nearly $55K (out the door) for the '14 S4. If I was an entry level buyer today, I'm not sure the current A3 would do it for me. I feel the '06 A3 was a better value and car for the time. Essentially, it has been 9 years and the entry level A3 is inferior to my '06 A3 in a lot of ways, plus costing more. The 2.0T A3 Quattro is the right ""entry"" level car, but still, I prefer the '06 interior."
2545,"April  9, 2015  4:30AM",andres3," I notice the benefits of AWD every time I stomp on it from a traffic light, or stomp on it making a 90 degree turn from a stop which would cause over steer in RWD and excessive wheel spin in FWD. I especially notice the same things when it's raining or the pavement is wet.  At the track I noticed I had developed some bad habits though, as it's possible to under steer and push the S4 around a turn, and still be able to rotate the car with the rear diff at the same time. Essentially you are forcing the car around the turn and pushing the front tires where you want to go even though they are not helping you accelerate. Not the fastest way to drive, and hard on the front tires. You can get away with it though, as the car is very forgiving to a heavy right foot."
2546,"April  9, 2015  2:54PM",graphicguy," I think that's why I'm anti-Audi right now. If they wouldn't have acted like posteriors, stepped up and taken care of the problems that they admitted to having, instead of jerking me around, they'd be on my shopping list.  So far, Cadillac has treated me as well/better as any other brand I've ever owned, that includes BMW, Audi, and Acura.  The CTS feels so solid, I can't quite see any parts flying off."
2547,"April  9, 2015  4:14PM",flightnurse,"  Mark, BMW allows people to add options that are not normally available on US cars, but this has to get the blessing of BMWNA, example, if you order a 328i Luxury Line, you can get the sport seats for $500. Infact many CA are not aware of this, I just found out that Tanszanite Blue Metallic ( an M car color) can be had on any BMW, for $1950, Rick and I both really like the color, I would assume if we got that color on the 328i GT it would be the only one in the US. What I was getting at, was, contact Audi NA and see if getting sport seats are allowed and if Audi will give you the blessing on this option. Doesn't hurt to ask."
2548,"April  9, 2015  4:17PM",flightnurse," I'll take it even further, the Sport seats on the F30 cars are wider and the bolsters aren't as big as on the E90 cars or E46 cars. I think people need to remember is, not everybody tracks their cars, so sport seats aren't needed. Dino, how many times as your wagon seen the track or driven to the point in which those Sport Seats where really needed?"
2549,"April  9, 2015  4:29PM",dino001,"You obviously never sat in them. Track has nothing to do with it. Good bolstering and correct profile are useful everywhere. I'm not talking about some supersporty Recaros - just decent bottom cushion with extended thigh support (which is probably my most favorite thing about this particular seat) and well-profiled back cushions keeping you in place as you turn the car on signals at any speeds with the back profile having adjustable lumbar support that doesn't kill your back after 200 miles.  I have had cars with great seat profiles for over 10 years no - 2003 WRX, 2008 STI and 2012 328 with Sport Package. Bad seat profile is a deal breaker for me, period.  BTW - I'm quite heavy, so my bottom and back ""fill"" those seats perfectly. It means I'm just perfect size to take full advantage of the bolstering . Perhaps that's the reason I like them so much."
2550,"March 31, 2015  7:27PM",robr2," They'll get over it. IMHO, the Flying Spur has some resemblance to a late 90's A8. The Continental has some last gen 9-5 in the rear as well.  Yes, it will be built on the CD4 platform which will be stretched. 3.0L EcoBoost with AWD and an interior resplendent with chrome. Production begins next year as a 2017 model.

2553,"March 31, 2015 10:15PM",markcincinnati,"I have to assume that the reason these players (and many others) offer AWD options for their F and R drive models is first and foremost a marketing/market penetration decision.  We can (and often do) debate the efficacy of AWD or if a given 911 performs better or is easier or harder to drive if equipped as RWD or AWD, etc etc.  I have to assume that BMW, to pick one, had managers and engineers who were against AWD making its way into the BMW family. Today it is the rare BMW that cannot be had with AWD.  The reason for the proliferation of AWD models is -- wait for it -- because they are popular, they sell well and if you don't offer an LPS or ELLPS with AWD, and all of your competition does, you will lose market share, lose revenue, lose profit, and you will lose your job. It doesn't even matter if it can be proven that AWD is better, the same as or worse than whateverWD. AWD rules the income statement or if it doesn't ""rule"" it certainly is way too large a percentage of sales to be overlooked.  Bring out a new high zoot premium vehicle of the species SEDAN and offer it with only two wheels driven, and, well pretty soon the car magazines will be apologizing to the market on behalf of the company justifying their not class leading sales on the oversight -- no AWD = lower sales.  It's the auto vs stick phenom -- everyone knows and agrees that sticks are superior but they linger on lots unsold and unloved. Go figure.  Sarcasm is difficult to do in these things sometimes.  Because you know It's all about that bass, 'Bout that bass, no treble It's all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble It's all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass, no treble It's all 'bout that bass, 'bout that bass  With apologies to Meghan Trainor for slightly changing the lyrics.  bass = $$$, of course (signed, Captain Obvious)"

2560,"April  1, 2015  2:34PM",graphicguy,"Continental has a storied name. Did a little research last night on the Continental (which is a moniker that Bentley also uses). At different times, the Continental was indeed a separate Ford brand. Mostly though, it was a model of Lincoln (usually the top Lincoln model).  Again, not sure where Ford is taking Lincoln. Aside from what appears to be a very successful ad campaign for the brand with McConnehey (sp?), I'm not sure how they can sustain the models they have if their only differentiation from the similar Ford models is a little chrome on the grill and some interior differences.  I mentioned in another thread that several months ago, I was offered a %75 gift card to test drive a Lincoln. I drove an MKZ and their small SUV (can't recall the model). They were not bad drives at all. And, were nice in most respects. But, they were also about $10K for the exact same drive in a Fusion or Escape, save for a few extra niceties.  Nonetheless, they're pretty cars. Scoff if you must, but if the Continental comes out and is anywhere near reasonably priced, it will do well. Maybe not our cup of tea. But, Hyundai has proven that when you bring a nice car to market, that may have only 90% of the capabilities of the stalwarts in the category, the cars will sell."

2566,"April  2, 2015  2:45AM",markcincinnati," I did say sarcasm was difficult to convey in these posts -- stick shifts are unloved because the MARKET has determined the automatics, NOT the stick shifts are superior. This, however is not said with sarcasm.  Perception is reality -- sticks are not perceived to be as VALUABLE by those who actually buy cars. The ""supposed throngs"" longing for stick shift cars are statistically insignificant and practically irrelevant.  If there are any stick shifts on dealer lots, they have probably been there for a long time.  When I bought my 2014 S4 the dealer did have ONE manual trans version in stock. My wife and I took it for a test drive -- it was a blast. However, my S-tronic (7 speed dual clutch) auto trans beats it by a country mile.  The MARKET has spoken. In some respects, I guess I'm just the messenger willing to accept the MARKET's decision."
2567,"April  2, 2015  2:58AM",markcincinnati,"By the way, for those who poo-poo AWD and say it ia unnecessary of that it contributes to building a false sense of security, why does Porsche offer 20 different 911 models and market most with AWD?  My answer is because the MARKET wants and is willing to pay for it.  But the protests about AWD are about as loud, maybe louder, than those howls about the dearth of manual transmissions that can be had in this market segment.  I would, however, assume that Porsche would not offer so many, nearly all in fact, of the cars they bring to market with AWD if it actually eroded performance.  Ferdinand Piech (hope that is spelled correctly) said he thought all cars would offer AWD someday (and he said that in the '80s) -- those who championed RWD proclaimed ""no way"". BMW lovers said there would never be an AWD BMW; and Mercedes folks said there would never be an FWD Mercedes.  Hmm?"
2568,"April  2, 2015  3:02AM",Mr_Shiftright,"AWD doesn't erode performance-- it actually helps performance, but it's just not related very much to handling and braking--in some cases, detrimental to it.

2569,"April  2, 2015 11:41AM",robr2, I am quite aware that Continental was once a distinct brand tate Ford used. It existed for only two years before being folded into Lincoln in 1957.  To bring it back today would be a financial fiasco. It makes more sense to focus on strengthening the Lincoln brand rather than resurrecting a brand that hasn't been used for almost 50 years.

I doubt a $75K price point would work; that's too high by 1/3."
2573,"April  4, 2015  4:57PM",Mr_Shiftright,Well they could do like they did with the first Lexus--undercut the competition at first by $10K-$15K and then gradually increase it if the model is popular.
2574,"April  7, 2015  5:54PM",markcincinnati,"Someone somewhere once said, ""Life is full of disappointments, get used to it.""  My wife took her 2014 SQ5 to the dealer service dept for the 35K service interval. This dealer typically aligns the car they offer the customer as their loaner car with the customer's actual car. Well, of course they don't have loaner SQ5's (didn't even think they would); so they offer her an S4. She said, ""Since my husband has an S4, could you put me in something that I don't normally have access to?"" Service adviser -- who knows us well -- says, ""Sure, what would you like?"" My wife says, ""How about an A7 or S7."" ""Well the last A7 just left, but we have a 2015 3.0T A6 with sport package that you might find interesting . . . ""  Longer story short: She takes the sported-up A6 and drives it to work, the grocery store and home. Next morning (Saturday) she asks me to return the A6 and pick up the SQ5.  The A6 is, hmm, sublime, it is so smooooth and powerful and almost eerily quiet. The thing accelerates with a great deal of urgency but somehow behind the wheel there is virtually no drama. There's a certain tightness to the suspension (better be, it had the sport suspension and upsized wheels and tires) -- I got the sense this (relatively) large car was proving itself to be damn near nimble.  And, at $59K, it is about the same MSRP as my S4. I could see myself driving this thing -- it has more comfort, but it appears to give up but little in responsiveness to the wheel and whip.  Then I get into a stretch that I know from many years of experience is full of twisties and off-camber turns and those kind of ""liquid potholes"" -- undulations in the pavement that have yet to break through to the substrate. Kind of upside down speed bumps.  In any case, I am seriously looking forward to the ride.  That is, until I take my first corner at speed -- about triple what the posted ""curve ahead"" yellow sign with the big black arrow ""suggests."" The car has NO issue taking the turn, It seems unflapped by my request for it to turn in sharply -- it does not understeer (that I could tell, anyway) and the tires didn't howl.  Damn, damn, damn -- the leather covered driver's seat is a flat as a board and about as slick as a kid's slide. The car takes the turn with great aplomb -- too bad it all but threw me overboard (thankfully I was wearing my lap/shoulder belt and was holding on to the steering wheel with both hands.)  Somewhere I heard, or thought I heard, ""WHOA NELLIE!""  My 2009 A4 Prestige with sport package and my 2005 A6 -- BOTH of THEM -- had sport seats (optional, yes). I returned the car to the dealer and at that exact moment in time, the sales team was sans customers, so I asked (thankful my opinion pertaining to the horrible ""bucket"" seats would not be overheard by any other customers), ""Can I order sport seats on a new A6 with the sport package?"" And, ""Can I order sport seats through the Audi Exclusive channel?""  The S6 (which is another $20,000) can have sport seats, the A6, no matter how optioned cannot.  What a world, what a world. I'm melting, melting."
2575,"April  7, 2015  6:44PM",tlong,"I recently visited an Audi dealer after many years away and took a look at the cars. I noticed thath the ""standard"" seat was very flat and uninspiring. The ""sport"" seats were highly bolstered and adjustable.  Back in time, my '98 A4 had its standard seats that were somewhere in between these two current extremes. It's unfortunate that the standard seats in current models look like couch seats and that there is no in-between level of bolstering similar to what you might find in a Honda or Mazda today. I thought the standard seats were pretty ugly."
2576,"April  7, 2015  6:49PM",roadburner,"The base seats in the newer BMWs are just mediocre, at best. The seats in my wife's E90 are not anywhere near as comfortable as the seats in my MS3- never mind the sport seats in my Club Sport or the E21 Recaros in my '02. My dealer has a CPO 135i stick with every option but the Sport or M Sport package. I'd be sorely tempted were it not for that omission."
2577,"April  7, 2015  7:18PM",markcincinnati,"I am so spoiled, and until Saturday I didn't even know it. The S4's seats (and I have the optional red leather upgraded ones) are both comfortable and grippy. For years the sport seat option was a stand alone upgrade and, as I recall, was priced at $550. Even adjusted for inflation and twice the cost, I'd go ahead and pay $1,000-ish for the upgrade -- seems like about $650 would be ""appropriate"" though.  The same is true, apparently, across the line -- the only way to get the really good chairs is to opt for the ""S"" or ""RS"" versions. Now, I am a fan, but I loved my 2.0T A4 with sport package when I picked it up in 2008. And, my '05 A6 also had the bolsters on it (a $1,000 option in ""dark burnt orange"").  Nothing gold can stay."

Not so, though. I also agree about the seats....nowhere near what I want. But, everything is a compromise. The A6 with the S4 motor is screaming cruiser.  My favorite seats were the sport seats in my Acura TL SH AWD. Comfortable with perfect bolstering.../not too much....not too little....just right. Decent padding, too (which I could not say with the S4 seats which were particularly unyielding) 2nd is in the CTS. Thigh extensions, really nice leather. Could use a bit more bolstering. But for overall use and comfort, they acquit themselves quite well."
2580,"March 30, 2015  8:55PM",qbrozen," I'm sure you just mistyped, stick, but balance and handling are not dependent on the driven wheels. Better acceleration traction in all conditions? Yes. That's it.  There is a reason why the Miata, one of the best-handling cars of all time, is NOT AWD."

I had the opportunity to drive a RWD vs AWD Porsche back to back and I thought the AWD car pushed a lot in the turns. It's more work. For driving pleasure I would have chosen the RWD. Snow is not an issue where I live, so it's hard to justify the weight and expense of AWD in this zip code. The reason I bought a used 4WD truck was for flooding conditions--i.e., the ground clearance. I guess some AWD like Subaru do lift the car, which is nice--but my friend's Mercedes AWD doesn't seem to have any more ground clearance than normal. He doesn't seem to care or notice the AWD--it just came that way."
2592,"March 31, 2015  1:53PM",Michaell," When the wife wanted the Subaru Outback, she wanted something more ""wagon-y"" than the SUV's she'd been driving.  Once she got behind the wheel, that myth was shattered - the Subaru has the same height as our old Mazda CX-7. Same or better ground clearance as well.  If only Subaru had continued to make the Legacy wagon ... that would have been perfect."
2593,"March 31, 2015  1:57PM",m6user,"Let me be perfectly clear.  I don't consider AWD  a need but I find it very nice to have many days during the winter and on some rainy days.  It always seems that the people that are so sure it doesn't help get you around more efficiently in the winter are those that live in Florida or Arizona for example.  I have a rwd truck and have had plenty of rear wheel drive cars.  And like I said, equipped the same and driven with common sense the awd will be much easier to get around on slippery, snowpacked roads.  Ground clearance isn't a big deal for me as it is rarely a factor in the Midwest. But slushy or hardpacked snowy roads are very common and awd makes much more secure footing when in traffic and pulling or merging into traffic.  I never said anyone has to have awd but you guys make it sound like anyone that has it doesn't know how to drive.   Comes off a little arrogant IMO."
2594,"March 31, 2015  2:28PM",robr2, Subaru dropped the wagon for a couple of reasons. First it wasn't a great seller. Second was the fact that it's MPG wasn't that great and affected their CAFE number. The Outback is considered an SUV and it's MPG doesn't count against CAFE.

2600,"March 31, 2015  4:53PM",laurasdada,"I grew up in the era of FWD and ""Hot Hatches."" My first car was an original VW Scirocco, followed by an arrest-me-red Mitsubishi Mirage Turbo. Being a lifelong resident of New England, and a skier, I never had any real issues with FWD and all-season tires (until my lovely '05 Acura TL). I told folks why add the price, complexity and performance/MPG drain of AWD when FWD and snow/winter tires would likely be more than enough 99% of the time? Even FWD with all-seasons got me where I was going. Of course, ground clearance is another factor...  But, my TL was just not as good in the snow as previous FWD'ers. So, I bought snow tires on dedicated alloys (great deal at Tire Rack) and that problem solved. I had plenty of room to store four tires, and the cost of the tires/2x yearly swap was still less $ than AWD options. Of course, then I want nutsy, cuckoo and traded the TL for the V8/RWD Jaguar XK. With Summer tires. My first RWD, a whole new world of no go in snow. I mean, 1/8"" and I couldn't get out of my driveway! Luckily I had the option of an AWD SUV...  But, man plans and God laughs. Life changes and I suddenly-ish needed a 52 week car. Or a second car. Logic and maturity took over, hence adios glorious V8 sound, hello sensible pair of shoes Jag XF AWD. Could I have gone RWD XF with snows/rims? Of course, with the traction/stability control, snow mode tranny and good snows, I likely wouldn't have had any issues as, generally, a good job is done in snow plowing around here (even with 10' of snow this winter!). But, with nowhere to store a set of tires/rims (without paying to do so), I chose the path of least resistance and went AWD. No worries about the freak storm before/after snows have been swapped or storage and charges to swap tires.  So, I pay for my laziness. Need AWD? No. Glad I have AWD? Yes. XF was a champ in the blizzard I drove through last month on my way to ski Maine. Sad said blizzard was east of the mountains and didn't dump any new snow at the resort!  So, understand and choose your poison. No ""wrong"" answer."
2601,"March 31, 2015  5:02PM",laurasdada,"Oh, yeah. And what's cool is that most of the time the XF has a RWD bias, I believe it is 90% of the torque goes to the rear axle. Pushing the snow button changes it to 30/70 with the computer deciding upon when to make it 50/50."

2607,"March 31, 2015  7:10PM",Mr_Shiftright,"Yes, that's right, AWD does not improve handling...it improves acceleration. Which is where I got the idea of ""over confidence"" from---that you might end up going faster than you can safely stop.  I think a car with a good set of snow tires will beat an AWD on all seasons every time in cornering or braking because cornering ability on slick roads or during obstacle avoidance/braking is the job of tires and suspension, not the drivetrain.  Here's an interesting VIDEO from the UK that demonstrates this."

Something with a base price starting with a 6 is not entry level, no matter what it shares its underpinnings with. And, yes, of course a car can be optioned up with a ridiculous amount of gee-gaws, but that's largely irrelevant to the discussion. You can take a $16k Honda and put $20k of electronics, custom paint, and custom interior on it, but that doesn't change its class. Lipstick on a pig, in other words.

2613,"March 30, 2015  4:15AM",markcincinnati,"       Yeah but the magazines don't buy cars. My wife will not have a car without AWD here in Colorado even though we really only ""need"" it about 10-15 days per year.   Here's ""a"" thing -- not the thing, a thing: The list of BRANDs we discuss here (and elsewhere) that do not offer AWD versions of their models has diminished to an incredibly small number. Perception is reality is the phrase we live by, even if we don't always agree. The perception is that the higher performing models from Audi, BMW and Mercedes (just to name the Germans for an example) now offer AWD virtually if not literally and I think we're closing in on literally, across their entire lines. Porsche, clearly not an LPS generally speaking, has 20 different cars for sale all called 911's -- I believe they are all offered with AWD. And, often the ones (of any ilk, brand or type) that achieve the most ""wins"" are the AWD models.  But, even if that were not true -- what really matters is what people buy. Pull into a parking lot of a high zoot country club and look at the trunk emblems on the carefully parked high buck LPS (or, of you ike ELLPS) cars -- the majority of them will be xdrive, CTS or ATS4's, or quattros or four-matics or AWD badged in some way.  Let's assume that my wife and your wife, knowing that they can only actually REQUIRE AWD for about 2-5 days per year (for go power in snow); and that they could probably go if they would use winter tires with FWD or RWD, just fine, were asked if they would give up AWD. I am positive the answer from my wife would be, ""don't take away my AWD.""  The perception and the sales have been pointing to AWD, automatic transmissions, not naturally aspirated engines, more than 6 speeds in the transmission (or at the very least, nothing less than 6 speeds) and more and more electronic driving aids.  Entry level may have started off as meaning ""cheaper versions"" of higher line cars from a given mfg. And, as a practical matter, at base, no options, that is, MSRP, that is still true. But I am today convinced (by virtue of what the dealer folks tell me) that the only reason for a given BASE MSRP is the tv commercial and the lease price. And, even that is changing -- now the tv ads tout the car that is being advertised for $X pre month is ""nicely equipped"" -- if you hit the pause button and read the fine print, the cars being advertised are more and more likely to no longer be base models. Unless mandated to do so, you would be hard pressed to even find a base price model at a dealership.  The reason is no one will buy one of this class of car NEW at least without the ""premium"" package on it, so dealers stock their lots -- since most Americans won't orders cars, cause they have to have it today -- with cars that are popularly equipped. This translates to a lot, but not all, of the options on the check sheet.  I spoke to a German dealer rep who thought we (Americans) were crazy for ""always"" putting sunroofs in our cars since those of us who have them rarely, if ever, open them. Big bucks for a vestigial options. It is virtually impossible to get a German car sans sunroof -- and if you try, well you for sure throw yourself into a class of car that the leasing organizations will not sub-vent, because they have the experience with a market that won't buy a car that doesn't have a sunroof, even if no one ever opens them.  The point of all of this is to say, OK, I'll concede the historical meaning of ELLPS meant ""low cost"" -- but what is now ELLPS, then would have to be A3's, but NOT A4's (the B9's will certainly cost more than the B8's, even at base, strippie levels.) Then we need somewhere to put the A4's, 3 series and C class's -- to say nothing of some of the other ""premium"" offerings from Asia and America.  If you agree about the use of the term Entry Level as not necessarily being about $, the M3, for instance is the Entry Level M car -- and, at this point in time, there is no Entry Level RS car, unless you accept that Audi has chosen for whatever reason to only offer an RS4 as a ""station wagon"" -- and one, even at that, that cannot be had in the US.  We can go on about our business, and as long as we do not violate the terms of use of the Edmunds organization, who cares if we agree or disagree or agree to disagree about size or base MSRP.  I'm interested in speaking with, in print, folks who love (or at least like) luxury performance sedans -- and, here, luxury performance sedans that are compacts -- thus ruling out their big brothers and sisters, the 5's, E's, etc.  Even then, if someone is shopping for a 5 and goes with a 3 or a 7, I would find their thoughts and comments of interest.  If LPS is supposed to include ""I wish I was an LPS car"" type of vehicle, I'm not interested so much.  I think the VW CC or Passat are good cars -- interesting cars, perhaps even desirable cars, but today I don't think they are members of the LPS club. But they certainly are priced lower, for the most part. It's just they aren't LPS class cars. If we're looking to discuss them, we all know where to go.  The reason for the A3 and CLA (for example)? According to the two dealers I spoke with, the reason for these new, less expensive models is that the ELLPS variants typically sell for a number beginning with either a high four number or a low five number -- these new models allow folks who want to be in the Mercedes family to join for $37,500 rather than $57,500 -- and hopefully will trade UP next time.  I believe Mercedes is just following the Alfred P Sloan model -- start them out with a Chevy and hopefully they'll eventually buy a Cadillac. Start them out with a CLA and maybe someday they'll be back for an S Class.  It could work.  I think entry level is a name that needs some rethinking. The lower cost of the ELLPS vs the LPS is, apparently, a function of the wheelbase, length overall and width of the model -- back to the EPA classification, if you will."
2614,"March 30, 2015  4:47AM",m6user,"""these new models allow folks who want to be in the Mercedes family to join for $37,500 rather than $57,500 -- and hopefully will trade UP next time.""  That's exactly what an ""entry"" level car is. ELLPS is the lowest price performance sedan of a given maker. If a car qualifies all the alphas then it should be included. I don't personally see the CLA, ILX and 320 for examples as performance sedans even though they are entry level luxury."
2615,"March 30, 2015 12:55PM",graphicguy,"All good points. The starting numbers, for all cars, are now in the high teens. Those prices are populated by the Fiat 500, Kia Soul, Hyundai Accent, Cruise, Fiesta, etc. Most, if not all, sacrifice one or the other portions or power, refinement, quality of materials, material quality, etc. Sometimes sacrificing a lot of everything. That's how they get to those price points.  Some manufacutrer have become quite clever. They'll wrap their ""cheap"" cars in innovative styles. Look close enough, and it's hard to mask the underlying cost cutting.  When you move up that ladder, into the Civics or Accords, Corollas or Camry, Fusion, Malibu, Mazda 3 or 6, etc., you crack that $25K price, with the best of them hitting the low $30s.  From my perception, that's where the A3, CLA, 320i, ILX, probably a 2.5L ATS want to play (I suppose you can throw the Infiniti G in there, but that's pretty old these days). Not the best those brands can do, but it gets you in the door of the brand. 3 year lease is over, You think, I'm making a little more money, and boy was that C Class ever sexy looking when I was last in the showroom and hopefully, if you had a good experience with the previous car, you're driving off in a $45K C Class, or A4, or 328, loaded up TLX, or an ATS with the better drivetrain, with more options.  All of a sudden, all those promises of having a good portfolio and compound interest are starting to bear fruit. Now, you're in the $50K-$60K bracket. Now, you're looking at E Class, A6, CTS. You wouldn't dream of sullying your driveway with an Impala (even though it's every bit as good as an XTS).  Mark, you're right. That's what Sloan started, and the hope for all these brands, how they want to ""hook"" you from the start.  Where Mercedes and BMW seem to have an advantage, they've positioned themselves as aspirational brands. Cadillac used to be there. I think some of that is still there. Their missteps have cost them some of that, though. I've not driven an A3. But, I have driven an S3. Fun car. To live with it everyday? Probably wouldn't be my choice. Test drove a CLA. That is not a good car. An Accord is better in every way. But, you have a Mercedes, an aspirational brand. And, you're in it for about the price of a loaded Accord.  I'll accept that the 320i is a good car based in FN's reports. But, I've only driven one when my sister was shopping them (she ended up with a C Class.......BECAUSE IT WAS A MERCEDES...320i was the better car, IMHO). Audi wasn't on her radar based on my experience with them.  Audi and Acura are FWD architectures. Today, these platforms are SO GOOD, it really doesn't matter to me. I know for many of you, it does. The Mercedes, Cadillac (ATS/CTS) are RWD platforms. But, Mercedes is bringing their FWD platform here, too.  What does any of this have to do with ELLPS? Probably not diddly....except everyone in here will be in the Audi, Acura, Cadillac, BMW, Mercedes showrooms sometime in the next 24 months....guaranteed."

The only thing the limit on base msrp does is exclude other models that start much higher, such as the M, AMG, S, or V examples. markcincinnati said: The point of all of this is to say, OK, I'll concede the historical meaning of ELLPS meant ""low cost"" -- but what is now ELLPS, then would have to be A3's, but NOT A4's (the B9's will certainly cost more than the B8's, even at base, strippie levels.) Then we need somewhere to put the A4's, 3 series and C class's -- to say nothing of some of the other ""premium"" offerings from Asia and America. So, like I said earlier, the only reason I'm thinking the cutoff is cost, not size, is to allow BMW and Caddy to play here on equal ground. I mean, I suppose its not unrealistic to compare a 328 to an A3, but then folks would be arguing those two don't directly compete. Then we have to say ""ah, but you can't discuss the A4 because its not the entry-level model."" It just makes things more confusing. markcincinnati said: The reason for the A3 and CLA (for example)? According to the two dealers I spoke with, the reason for these new, less expensive models is that the ELLPS variants typically sell for a number beginning with either a high four number or a low five number -- these new models allow folks who want to be in the Mercedes family to join for $37,500 rather than $57,500 -- and hopefully will trade UP next time. BINGO! As m6user pointed out, that's EXACTLY the point of ""entry level."" To get you into the brand and keep you coming back for more. Its a gateway drug."
2618,"March 30, 2015  2:18PM",stickguy,"Q nailed it. These are the models to get the budget challenged into the category/brand. Not the highest performance or most luxurious, but with reasonable quantities of both. Size is not that important. Nor is drivetrain configuration. Badge and price are."
2619,"March 30, 2015  2:23PM",stickguy,"My son is a good example. First job, new car, tight finances. He got a Jetta. SE. Wanted a GLI, but got in fold and hooked on German cars. Already planning next one. Drools on an S3. Will probably settle for an A3. After that, will depend on how his budget (and family if one comes along) grows! But he does aspire to move up the ladder."
2620,"March 30, 2015  3:00PM",Michaell," Other than AWD and a few extra HP, what's the difference between the GLI and the A3?"
2621,"March 30, 2015  4:03PM",m6user,"Nicer interior, better warranty, dealer experience and luxury brand. For a young guy, pulling up to pick up your date in an Audi versus a Vdub could be a game changer. LOL."
2622,"March 30, 2015  4:05PM",roadburner,"Back to AWD, I can understand why you might want one in the mountains or the Northeast; but even in my neck of the woods people spring for AWD.(the reason we have a Jeep and and an X3 truck is because our 1500' gravel driveway rarely sees a plow- but note that my Wrangler made it through over 18"" of snow in 2WD thanks to BFG All Terrain KO tires with the Severe Snow rating).  What I find to be incredibly pathetic are the hopelessly inept souls who say that they can't own a RWD car because they need a vehicle that they can drive in the rain. What they really need is their license pulled in exchange for a handful of bus tokens..."
2623,"March 30, 2015  4:20PM",stickguy," I was going to say ""4 rings"". Though in a performance oriented car, the AWD can come in handy (he does live up in a heavy snow area in upstate NY). Something like a GLI where you are getting into low profile performance tires would likely require snow tires, and he has no place to keep those off-season."
2624,"March 30, 2015  4:45PM",m6user,"Yeah, well since he said ""besides AWD and a few extra HP"" I didn't address the AWD part. But that would be a large factor in that neck of the woods.  As far as people wanting AWD. A lot of people had RWD cars when they were younger and they remember the horrible situations in snow covered streets where they just spun and the rear end kicked out all over the place(I had a 1980 Camaro, loved it but not in the snow) because that was before better all-season tires, ABS, traction control, etc. And after FWD cars took over the availability of RWD mainstream cars is somewhat limited. A lot of people haven't driven a RWD car since then, so the memories are their perception."
2625,"March 30, 2015  5:04PM",robr2, Perhaps the young man should reevaluate his date if that's what the measure she uses....  ...and that brings us back to the reason the vast majority of these ELLPS' are sold - prestige and the look at me factor.
2626,"March 30, 2015  5:39PM",Mr_Shiftright,"Any AWD system can be completed neutralized by the wrong tires and the wrong driver.  These are, after all, the two things that actually keep a car on the road.  Another factor is that many AWD sedans don't offer any greater ground clearance, so deep snow is going to defeat you anyway."
2627,"March 30, 2015  5:39PM",nyccarguy," So many times I hear someone say: ""my car stinks in the snow or my car drives terribly in the snow."" For the longest time I responded with: ""its probably not your car that drives terribly in the snow, if equipped with a proper set of winter tires you should have no problems."" That usually got the ""deer in the headlights stare"" at which point I would just say: ""You are right. you need AWD or 4WD."""
2628,"March 30, 2015  5:48PM",roadburner," Yep- the ""wearers."""
2629,"March 30, 2015  5:56PM",m6user,"If given the choice of driving the same exact vehicle with the same exact tires in a winter snowstorm, I would choose the AWD vehicle every time. People always say ""well if you used the right tires and drove like me you would have no issues"". Actually getting tired of hearing that. And there is a big difference between ""need"" and ""nice to have"". Do I need AWD in the winter around Chicago?.....not really. Is it very nice to have in certain situations where you need you need to get out of someone else's way or get going from a light in slippery conditions? Yes, it is very nice to have. Of course, I can get around without AWD as I occasionally drive my RWD v-8 truck in the snow but it isn't a lot of fun."
2630,"March 30, 2015  6:09PM",Mr_Shiftright,"Well that's an argument that isn't as strong as it first sounds because invariably over-confidence in AWD often leads to mishaps. If you doubt this, I invite you to talk to any tow truck driver who operates in or near a popular ski area. If nothing else, and it doesn't convince you, you'll get some entertaining stories.  No matter how you cut it, your car is kept on the road by four small patches of rubber--if that rubber has no grip, it woudln't matter if you had ten-wheel drive. Same with mud, or sand.  So my advice to anyone with AWD is to choose your battles wisely, and if you do, then you'll have the edge--all things being equal."
2631,"March 30, 2015  6:18PM",nyccarguy,"I have got to tell you, the more I think about it, the more I like the Audi S3 Premium Plus.

2634,"March 30, 2015  6:49PM",m6user,"""Well that's an argument that isn't as strong as it first sounds because invariably over-confidence in AWD often leads to mishaps.""  OMG, really? Never heard that one before. I see yahoos all the time thinking they can drive faster because of AWD. Sorry, but I'm not one of them. Didn't feel I had to put that qualifier in the argument. OK, same vehicle, same tires, same careful driving then. AWD is easier to get around in heavy snow and slippery conditions given the same type of driving. Does it allow one to drive like a maniac. Absolutely not.  And invariably means that it will always happen sooner or later right? Don't think you can say that about all drivers."
2635,"March 30, 2015  6:51PM",m6user,That does seem to be a nice price for the S3. Is that price good for all that equip??

2641,"March 25, 2015 10:42PM",robr2,Well let's go back to my list and note the sizes based on EPA standards:  Acura TLX Compact Audi A3 Subcompact BMW 320i Compact Buick Regal Midsize Cadillac ATS Compact Infinti Q40 Compact Lexus IS250 Compact Lincoln MKZ Midsize MB CLA Compact Volvo S60 Compact  The others mentioned:  Acura ILX Compact Audi A4 Compact MB C Class Compact  So differentiating by size isn't going to clear the water any....
2642,"March 26, 2015 12:00AM",cdnpinhead, Some more than others.
2643,"March 26, 2015  3:36AM",m6user,"I don't pay any attention to what category the EPA puts a car in. Heck, they classify the Bentley 12 cyl as a compact car. Don't think too many people look at one of those and say ""boy, that's a sharp compact car""."
2644,"March 26, 2015  1:40PM",qbrozen,"Actually, the ILX/A3/CLA/1-series are subcompacts. Then you have your compacts (A4, C-class, 3-series, ATS), your midsize (5-series, etc), and your full-size (7-series, etc). There is the microcar class below all of that, but the luxo players haven't ventured there yet.  So, yes, I agree with where I think you are going ... boards that divide by class and forget this whole pesky ""entry level"" tag, since that obviously varies by manufacturer for the time being."
2645,"March 26, 2015  3:56PM",breld,"I like the above take from @stickguy and @qbrozen. Looking at these by class, and including the emerging sub-compact class, makes sense to me.  So, does that mean we rename the acronyms?  Sub-compact Luxury And Performance (SLAP) Compact Luxury and Performance (CLAP)  I don't know - just doesn't sound good to be aspiring to get the CLAP."
2646,"March 26, 2015  3:58PM",robr2, Except that the ILX and CLA are both considered compacts by the EPA. So are we now going to identify by barely a compact and almost a mid-size?
2647,"March 26, 2015  4:15PM",qbrozen,"They are? Huh. Where do I look that info up? Because I tried fueleconomy.gov and they list the Aston Rapide S as subcompact, so methinks that's not a reliable source.  EDIT: So it took quite a bit of searching, but it seems the CLA has 101 total cubic feet of interior volume, while the C-class sedan has 100. Go figure. Oh, and the Rapide has 97?? I give up trying to figure this out. Seems to be pretty apparent that interior volume means a whole lotta nothing."
2648,"March 26, 2015  5:07PM",robr2," Well the EPA is fueleconomy.gov so it is a reliable source. Here is the link:  http://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/byclass/byEPAclassNF.shtml  The EPA measure cubic footage of the seating areas. Based on that criteria, the Rapide is a subcompact. Aston designed the Rapide with 4 tight seats with a huge console running through the middle of the car. Don't blame the EPA for Aston's poor space utilization.  Many people look at a car, see a big exterior, and expect the interior to be large. Hence, interior volume is what is measured by the EPA."
2649,"March 26, 2015  5:59PM",m6user,"I really don't know anyone, myself included, that consults with or cares what class the EPA designates a car. Manufacturers seldom market their cars using the EPA categories."
2650,"March 26, 2015  6:05PM",robr2," I'm sure that not consulting the EPA class is true for the vast majority of car shoppers. But it is something that is common across all vehicles that can be measured. The fuel economy listed on the Munroney sticker uses it as a guide.  As for manufacturers seldom marketing using the EPA categories, I disagree. You will often hear the phrase ""Best whatever in it's class."" That typically refers to the EPA category."
2651,"March 26, 2015  6:15PM",qbrozen,"Agree, now that I know how its done, EPA classes are useless.  Do the euro classifications work? Not sure I have time to sift through them all, but specifically dividing C-segment from D-segment. At first glance, it appears to be CLA/A3 in the C-segment and C-class/3-series/A4 in the D-segment. They don't list Acura since it doesn't exist there, but Civic is C-segment and Accord is D-segment."
2652,"March 26, 2015  6:34PM",m6user,"""You will often hear the phrase ""Best whatever in it's class."" That typically refers to the EPA category.""  I think they use whatever ""class"" they can construe to fit their advertising. I recall a discussion about the Ford Taurus which everyone knows is a large family sedan. I believe the EPA had it as a midsize based on interior volume but Ford markets it as a large family sedan. As it should IMO."
2653,"March 26, 2015  6:41PM",tlong,"Let's not forget that size impressions change over time. The Accord was a compact that went to a midsized and then a borderline-large car. The current Civic is larger than earlier Accords. And so Honda has introduced the Fit, which is larger than the first Civics. You can use the same analogy for the Corolla and then Yaris, or the A4 and then the A3, or the C-class and now the CLA.  The vehicles we used to think of as ""entry-level"" have gotten larger and new smaller models have been slotted in below them. In a lot of cases those new models are made more cheaply than the original grown models, so that adds a bit of additional complexity. For example my new '98 A4 was a similar size to the current A3 sedan, but I've sat in the A3 and I would say that the old A4 was a much more luxurious vehicle than the current A3, and it also performed better."
2654,"March 26, 2015  6:48PM",m6user,It seems like the luxury makers have new entry level cars that are not up to the same level of luxury nor performance of the cars that preceded them. So an argument could be made that they are not ELLPS because they don't have the luxury or performance level expected of the brand. I wasn't impressed with either the CLA or the ILX at the auto show from a luxury viewpoint.
2655,"March 26, 2015 10:22PM",markcincinnati," My head hurts less, now that we can go back to what I presume was actually intended from the get go:  ELLPS - Compact Sized Premium Sedans with Performance capabilities that are not an afterthought or based on trim, badges, decals and chrome  LPS - Mid Sized Premium Sedans with . . . .  Let's keep the Sub-compacts together but differentiate the ""LPS"" Sub-compacts by virtue of pedigree or genuine Luxury and Performance content. If the A3, despite it pedigree, for instance, can't muster anything else than its name to differentiate itself from a Jetta (or whatever), well it would be left out. I think we're all trying to allow, again for example, the ILX to be in a given class but simultaneously exclude the Civic despite the family resemblance.  SCLPS, EL or C LPS and LPS in short.  I would suspect the 3 series and A4 and C class and ATS buyers are more ""birds of a feather"" as would others of the Sub-compact size be birds of a feather. The price range, for example, of the ELLPS is so very wide, but the ""class"" as noted by the original post still seems to my old-fart's brain to be the one that's ""just right."" We've come full-circle.  Thank you.  Signed,  Goldilocks."
2656,"March 27, 2015 12:54AM",sweendogy,I agree with goldie-
2657,"March 27, 2015  3:53AM",markcincinnati,"Coming Soon  Picked up the S4 after the 25K service interval where it received an oil and filter change plus a brake fluid flush and refill. New battery for the smart key and a hand wash and front mat vacuum rounded out the ""no charge"" service. I had a new RED S4 as my loaner for the day. Things are going well, the brakes are said to be at 80% of new.  My rep tells me the new S4 will ""certainly"" have a horsepower and torque jump. The reason? The S4 is ALWAYS more powerful than the top of the line A6 (not S6, 3.0T supercharged A6). The new 2016 A6's on the floor have the same 333HP as my 2014 S4. In my mind, however, it just won't do for the S3 to outgun the S4, just like the S6 ""must"" outgun the S4 and so forth.  So, I'm thinking the new S4 will simply adopt the same motor as is in my wife's SQ5 -- 354HP. Apparently that is a no go -- it won't fit under the hood of the S4. So we're looking at what? 10%; would bump the S4 to 366 HP -- and with a bump in torque to 350, or so, wouldn't that be ""sufficient"" to out gun the S3, be bigger than the A6, but still be outgunned by the S6 and S8, etc.  Well, if my sales rep knows some bump is a certainty, don't you think BMW does too? The 335 is due for what a 15% bump? And so forth?  The horsepower (and torque) ""wars"" continue and continue and continue.  How many speeding tickets does it take before your insurance company dumps you or you end up in jail? Making a lighter A4 line and bumping the power by ""only"" 10% is certainly a recipe for ""license and registration please . . . Mark."" God I hate it when the traffic cop knows you by name.  Can't wait for the new uprated power -- coming soon to a [German] car near you."
2658,"March 27, 2015 12:19PM",graphicguy,"This was a few years ago, but I was doing a little stoplight wars with my (then) relatively new Mustang GT. Not a slow car by any stretch. Until, I got into a little friendly throttle blip war with an F150 in the next lane.  Lite goes green. Throttle mashed, good shift from 1st to 2nd, an even better one from 2nd to 3rd until we both backed off. But, he was 100 feet ahead of me when we did. Ended up he had debadged and chipped what ended up being an F150 Lightning.  From that p;point forward, as long as my vehicles were quick, I was happy.  Loved my time with the Mustang, the S4 and my 335i. Emphasis for me these days is the whole package. If it doesn't go well, if it doesn't handle well, if it's not put together well, if it isn't relatively pain free from a maintenance and reliability standpoint, it's not on my radar."
2659,"March 27, 2015  4:19PM",roadburner,"  Agreed; that's what I like about my MS3 it's relatively quick(especially since I boosted the horsepower and removed the ludicrous top speed limiter), handling is very good(if you don't mind the slow in-fast out point and shoot driving style), and it's still a comfortable cruiser. I also like the fact that it is a true sleeper. Right now I'm trying to decide my next car will be a focused track toy or a more luxurious Grand Tourer. In either case it will almost certainly be a RWD coupe with at least 350 bhp and three pedals."
2660,"March 27, 2015  5:45PM",flightnurse,"I think people are missing the point on price, the prices people are quoting is MSRP, who pays MSRP? So a 320i with premium package, Leather, Sport Package and Lighting Package $41,400. Can be had easily for $38,400 and right now BMW has $1,500 debate on cars on the dealers lot, $36,900. I'm sure you can get said 320i for even less then this. So for under$40K you can have a ELPS this is with manual transmission... Lease Payments for said BMW with mim down of about $1,100 for tax's and fee's would be roughly $350/m. Now a 328i with Sport package, Premium package (includes Leather) and lighting package is $45,500 (MSRP) Could be has easily for $40,800 this includes $1,500 rebate BMW has, and I'm sure you could get this price down even more.. With mim down, lease payments would be roughly $375/m  So when you guys are throwing around prices, lets be realistic, who on this board pays MSRP for their cars? No one... Real world data is showing that people are paying a lot less for their cars."
2661,"March 27, 2015  5:51PM",m6user,Nobody is missing the point. Everyone realizes what you're saying but some deals are better than others for a variety of reasons. That's why people use MSRP for reference. It's like using the EPA MPG numbers. Everyone knows that peoples mpg varies some but for comparison purposes the EPA numbers are best to use. There is always somebody that got $10k off or pays close to MSRP for some oddball reason or gets 40mpg in a car rated for 32. Better to deal with verifiable numbers for comparison sake.
2662,"March 27, 2015  7:54PM",qbrozen,"exactly. And deals vary throughout the year. MSRP is the only way that makes consistent sense.  By the way, @markcincinnati, I still think pricing is part of the equation. I'd like a combination of size class and pricing. B-class cars with starting MSRP under $40k, for example."
2663,"March 27, 2015  8:33PM",markcincinnati,"QB: wouldn't that mean that the Audi S4 (not RS) and the BMW 335 (not M) would be ineligible? I know we can (and do) discuss pretty much whatever we want here (within certain parameters) but we would really narrow the category and the forum(s) down quite a bit if we put a cap of $39,999 as a starting point; unless of course you meant the 335 would be allowed in because there are 3 series cars that do fit this criteria.  Thus: a 320 ""invites"" all ""3"" class cars along with it.  I do not have access to ""unlimited"" funds (as a practical matter, few of us do, even the 2%-ers) -- but my search and the folks I know and ""fraternize"" with (middle and upper-middle class earners) typically buy/lease within a 2 class range. Example: my neighbor says he's looking at BMWs. I say ""what model?"" He says, ""probably a 5 series, the 3 is too small, maybe a 7 series, I'll have to see what kind of deal I can get.""  One day, I see what I presume is a new 535ix with dealer plates in his driveway. As I pass, I roll down my window and stop to ask, ""is that the new ride?"" He says, ""they gave it to me for the weekend, I have to take it back Monday, I dunno."" I say, ""you'll really appreciate the X-drive if we have another winter like this one.""  He says, ""no poop?!?"" (not really).  Next time I drive by -- a few days later, I see a new 7 series in the driveway with temp tags on it. When I see him next, I ask him about it. He tells me, ""the lease payment on this car wasn't much more than the payment on the 5 and this thing is loaded -- I couldn't turn it down.""  Now, for all I know he was set on a 7 series all along -- he is a tall drink of water. But I think he was assuming the 5 series would be fine and fit the financial parms he and his wife had set. Well, when for a ""little more"" he could have a 7 series, well it was probably NOT an agonizing decision.  The thing that cracks me up is what ""always"" happens (and if you don't believe me, spend some time on Audiworld's forums): the new fill-in-the-blank is acquired (purchased, financed or leased) and about 15 minutes later, the proud new owner is browsing Tire Rack, APR, (fill in the blank for your brand of LPS car) etc for ""all the stuff"" that this brand new owner will buy to modify his (or her) new ride.  I have seen -- again, over on Audi World -- folks announce the new A4 they've just ordered, then announce that the car is at the dealer, then post picture of the new car (while it is still at the dealership) with the title of the post ""Let the Mods Begin.""  Folks (broad generalization) buy/lease any of these cars that can genuinely and without qualification be in the ""something"" LPS class and then dump another dump-truck of money on aftermarket tires and wheels, engine management chips, pullies, exhaust systems, brakes, lights, spoilers, coil-overs, audio systems, nav systems, headlights, tail-lights, interior treatments, and . . . (the list goes on and on and on -- thank you SEMA).  It seems to me if you have ""graduated"" to the luxury performance sedans (etc), that you can, practically speaking, pretty much afford anything you damn well please.  The wheels and tires alone ""y'all"" spring for on an otherwise very well equipped 335 or Q50 or S4 cost a young fortune -- yet ""y'all"" go ahead and plunk down the forty-nine, eleventy-twelve thousand dollars on the car and then just for grins put on a $2,400 set of rims with $1,200 worth of rubber on them without batting a freakin' eye.  What really cracks me up is the folks who acquire an A4 and then spend thousands on engine, suspension and tire and wheel mods so that they can create what they designate as an AS4 -- when for another $50 a month they could've had an S4 and be done with it (and the warranty would still be in full force, too).  One A4 buyer purchased one without navigation and then worked and worked until he found all of the parts required to retro-fit the Audi OEM nav system into the thing -- talk about costing a fortune. I often wonder, why not buy an A4 and see how much money and sweat it will take to fit the DSG transmission in place of the 8-speed tiptronic.  It ain't the money that compels ""our"" actions in this class of car -- at least as far as the fan site participants are concerned. Some of the aftermarket audio systems, too, cost more than a new 4K 79"" UHDTV.  AMEX - don't leave home without it.  These are LPS cars we're talking about -- within middle and upper middle class lunacy and normalcy you're just gonna have to get rid of the notion of $40K -- it jus' isn't a thing anymore (if it ever was)."
2664,"March 28, 2015  1:56AM",sweendogy,"I like the idea of a bmw that's sporty for under 40k....but el cheapo with auto (which some herd have ) is not it.

2665,"March 28, 2015  4:00PM",graphicguy,"BMW is all about the lease payment. I was not a typical customer for them, since I don't lease. When I bought my first one, a fair amount of time ago, my sales guy was a little taken aback by me negotiating based on a purchase. He said they always negotiated payment. He's a good guy. Whenever I walk into the dealership, he knows I'm seriously looking and not just kicking tires. We go straight to the ""dealer sheet"", allegedly with his cost and MSRP on it.  Point of all this, you guys are right. The only consistent price point you can depend on is the MSRP. We don't pay that. But, it's the only consistent number you can reliably use, that has no bearing on geography, lease vs buy, demand (or not), etc.  I still say the ""base"" price can't exceed $45K for EL. That means the A3/4 gets in, but the S4 doesn't, for example."
2666,"March 28, 2015  8:02PM",qbrozen,"I could be talked into $45k, which allows the 335i, but not the 335ix. I could go either way, frankly. I think $40k would make more sense after BMW releases a smaller class here in the US to compete with the CLA/A3"
2667,"March 29, 2015  2:44AM",markcincinnati,"What is the issue with the base price? The class of car which means ""who knows"" what the base price will be is what this is all about. The A3 is a sub compact, the A4 is a compact. If this is to be about sub-compacts, well I guess that is OK, but then we would need yet another cubby hole to poke the B8 Audis and the entire lineup of 3's. These are LPS cars -- but a bit smaller. In some instances it is easily possible to have the 3 series priced at more than the 5 series.  Is there a debate about the ""maximum"" MSRP (base) for the full sized LPS's?  It may well be true that a 335 would fit a $45K ceiling (for an RWD only version), but -- according to the BMW dealership here in River City -- over 40%, of all 3 series sold are AWD. And, here in our climate, I was told the number now favors the x - drive versions as the majority sold.  The 3 series -- from bottom to top -- are in the compact class. MSRP ranges from a number beginning with a $3 to a number beginning with a $6.  There are NO 335's with a window sticker under $50K, unless someone has deliberately ordered one totally stripped. There are no S4's under $50K either -- but I have seen S4 manual transmission versions with but one option that squeak by at a hair over $50K.  Likewise, I shopped the IS350 Fsports and they were ALL over $50K (if they were AWD).  We need to talk about either sub-compacts or compacts here. Since the MSRP's (from a practical standpoint) are all over the board, we need to think, for example, 3 series, not 3 series until they exceed $40 or $45K.  Those who lease (apparently the majority) shop mo pay, not MSRP. And those who do buy, well, of course they're welcome too. I am simply arguing to be inclusive.  Spend some time on the Mercedes build your own board and see how quickly the C class heads up up and away. Even the ATS when well equipped goes ballistic with aplomb and ease."
2668,"March 29, 2015  4:10AM",nyccarguy,I think the 320i is going to be a tremendous value once they start coming off lease ans selling as CPO BMWs for the low to mid $20K.
2669,"March 29, 2015  3:15PM",dino001,"  Mark, I think it seems there is a vantage point gap between you and some other guys here. You seem to be getting mostly top of the line, or at least well into the options, whereas a lot if other guys seem to be fishing in much less equipped ponds and get freaked out by anything more than 50 on the sticker. They said so repeatedly. It may be because they live by their memories (what it used to cost), or perhaps by simply how much they could afford. For myself, I don't look at cars at their base. If I can't afford its mid-to-high option version, the car is not for me. I see no point is a stripper, but I understand why somebody may actually go for it. But that vantage point difference is very real. I generally agree with inclusion of 335 in this class, but it barely squeaks into. S4 used to be IMHO above 335, but that was before they eliminated V6 version of A4 and S4 took its place, giving space to RS4/5. I totally disagree on M or RS. There is absolutely NOTHING entry level about it, from pricing, to chassis, to engineering. ZERO. Other than superficial likeness, those are different cars than their lower cousins, essentially from ground up. Small size? Porsches are even smaller, so what? That's not enough."

Based on ""history,"" I would keep the A3 and A4 in separate classes of automobiles. And, how is it that both the ATS and CTS can be ELLPS, does that mean the XTS is now the model called LPS?  One point of clarification, my inclusion of cars in this class that can be optioned to numbers deep into the $60K range is NOT the base price. It is the potential price if optioned.  Just like the 320 can have over $15,000 of options added cranking it to just south of $48K, I was suggesting the RANGE from low to high. Most folks won't go for either end, I would assume.  And, each of us brings experience to the buying of cars -- and also to our expectations of features. I cannot see a car without a backup camera, and frankly, I would think top-view is better still. It is a situation where, due to incrementalism, we get a car with, say, back up camera, and then you miss it when it is not there.  Of course, it will be made mandatory by the insurance institute due to the reduction in claims, so you'd better get one sooner rather than later.

2682,"March 25, 2015  1:07AM",tlong," So adding to the fun, I'd argue that the driven wheels shouldn't matter. If the vehicle performs well and has luxury, the wheels driven are a design issue. It is the performance that counts and there are quite a few vehicles that are fwd that still have good performance - some of them even have better steering feel than the current BMW 3 series which to me is a more important indicator of a sporty vehicle. I'm not usually cornering at .9gs or doing donuts in parking lots, so the driven wheels don't matter to me so much.  As far as entry level, I'd agree with previous posts - it should not be the brand, or the size, it should be *luxury* and *performance*, regardless of those other factors. You could argue that the ILX doesn't have enough luxury and/or performance, and if that is the case (not necessarily agreeing with that; only for argument), then it is the TLX which is the ""ELLPS"" for Acura since it's got a low enough price with the requisite amount of luxury and performance.

2687,"March 25, 2015 10:41AM",benjaminh,"The Acura ILX is about 6 inches longer than the Audi A3, and gets to 60 faster than the A3 1.8. At a little after 14 minutes in this long video Alex on Autos measures the acceleration of the ILX at 6.25 0-60, which seems to be about half a second faster than the A3 1.8. At 12:20 he talks about how Acura's 8-speed dual clutch is in some ways superior to that offered in the Audi A3. The Audi obviously has a lot more prestige, and arguably a nicer interior, but the Acura has more standard equipment—like moonroof, heated power seat, rearview camera, pushbutton start, LED headlights, etc. The A3 does have standard leather, while the base ILX has pleather. The A3 also has a better standard stereo. Overall, a comparably equipped A3 1.8 costs maybe about $4-5k more than an ILX, and yet the A3 is slower and gets lower mpg. I may be the only one, but I think if you're including the A3 1.8 then there's a case to be made for the ILX. But if you're starting with the A3 2.0 quattro, I guess that's a different story...."
2688,"March 25, 2015  1:48PM",robr2," Well based on my criteria of EL - base model that gets you into the brand - and get then be optioned out to give it the L and P, then the CLA is it for MB.  As for the ILX, many would say the inability to have AWD as option precludes it from being an ELLPS. If it were offered with SH-AWD, then it would be the starting point.  Lastly, someone noted that the Fusion and MKZ are based on the European Mondeo. That is incorrect. The current Mondeo was introduced after the Fusion and MKZ. The Mondeo is the exact same car as the Fusion and all 3 were engineered at the same time on a brand new platform."
2689,"March 25, 2015  1:58PM",ab348,The ILX also suffers from the stigma of being perceived by many as a tarted-up Civic. Even though the competing models are also built on existing mainstream platforms. the ILX tends to suffer from that more than most.

So a FWD A4 is not luxo, but an AWD version that is optioned exactly the same other than the driven wheels is now luxo? Doesn't make sense to me. They will both look and feel exactly the same when cruising down the highway, which is what luxo is all about.  And, as for the ILX being a tarted up Civic... if we use that as criteria, then we'd have to exclude many vehicles from this list. I think about half the luxo market is just tarted up versions of lower-ranking cousins."
2691,"March 25, 2015  3:19PM",venture," Sort of.  As I understand it, they were engineered together as you said, but the Modeo was delayed being introduced so the Fusion/MKZ were released first.  Why was the Mondeo delayed? Many opinions, but I don't know if anyone other than Ford really knows. The old version of the Mondeo was still selling well in Europe for one thing. Fitting of the 3 cylinder engines and diesel engines all seem to be possibilities. Plus they get the Estate wagon in Europe."
2692,"March 25, 2015  3:28PM",robr2,"The Mondeo was delayed by 3 years to allow Ford to focus on ""balancing the supply and demand of its industrial footprint.""

2698,"March 25, 2015  8:39PM",markcincinnati,"I guess I'm coming 'round to the notion that -- and this is only for example purposes -- both the A3 and A4 could be called ELLPS vehicles (but if I am doing so it is kicking and screaming). This whole thing is so darned subjective though, since I still harbor the notion that (pre A3), the A4 was ELLPS (even though you can crank the S4 to close to $70K) as [because?] the A6 was an LPS.  The ATS is ELLPS as the CTS is [now] LPS; as 3 series is ELLPS as 5 series is LPS.  Now, when the CLA and the A3 came along (and to a certain extent the ILX) we dropped from ""regular fit,"" to ""slim,"" and then finally to ""petite"" (sort of).  To some here EL is an indication of price -- but even those who go to the trouble can find the $ range for a 3 series to be from $32K to $87K.  I have -- historically -- thought of the ELLPS to be mostly a smaller version of the LPS family. Meaning size seems to (in MY mind) still be a better trait than cost. Hell, for the price of my S4, I could have had a Premium+ A6, but the size would clearly differentiate them.  I had not (and mostly still don't) considered the possibility of an A3 or CLA or ILX ever being considered for entry into the ELLPS class -- because of my [possibly wrongheaded] assertion that as nice (or expensive) as the [top o' the line] A3 family (which is called an S3) is, well, it is smaller than the already EL entrant, the A4.  Just as we bumped the CTS to the LPS class and replaced the then ELLPS CTS with the ATS, we may -- soon -- find ourselves needing to do the same thing with the ILX and A3.  Today, however, knowing only what is out there, it doesn't seem [to me] right to have both the ILX and the TLX called ELLPS cars -- just like it doesn't seem right to bracket the CLA and C Class Mercedes as ELLPS cars.  It seems that base price is the hang up -- not actual price -- for we don't seem to argue that a 5 series is an ELLPS anymore than we would argue an A6 or E class is an ELLPS -- we don't because there are model designations downstream (in both size and price).  We have (or the manufacturers have) blurred the lines somewhat -- and it will be another cycle before the cars are again (maybe) rationalized.  An ILX is an Acura. An ILX is a tarted up Honda A TLX has much more L + P than the ILX There is a car model, not just a badge, below the TLX -- and that is the ILX.  Currently the same breakdown is applicable to the A3 and A4 -- but the new A4 will what? Blur the lines further or sharpen the focus, make the two more readily differentiated? Does anyone think the CTS and ATS are the same class of car -- even though the MSRP of the ATS can be made to significantly overlap the MSRP of the CTS.  And so on.  I'll settle -- internally -- for the TLX to be in the same class as the A4, 3 series and C class. I'll accept the A3 and ILX and CLA as similar classified cars. I just find it difficult to have both the A3 and A4 designated as ELLPS cars if the 3 series is in the mix -- the 3 series is marketed against the A4 and C class, not the A3 and ILX class.  I'm more willing to overlook driven wheels -- but my own money would only go for an AWD vehicle knowing what I know and living in the climate I live in. This rules the ILX out -- but keeps the TLX SH-AWD firmly in the fold.  This is getting difficult for me to keep straight.  I love these forums, and I do not want to exclude anyone from them -- but for the sake of birds of a feather, so to speak, when I want to get into one of the forums, I'm not going to venture into the full-sized pickup truck forum since my interests are probably not going to be well served there (and vice versa).  I want to hear (read) your thoughts pertaining to similar vehicles -- I'm going to gravitate toward forums where the participants are interested in and experienced with 3 series, C class, B8 Audis (A4's), TLX's Q50's, etc, etc. I don't have interest in Malibus (not that there is anything wrong with them or those who write about them) or LaCrosses or 300's or 911's or Stingrays (same). Yes a fully tarted up S3 may give rise to a legitimate question about S3's vs A4's or S4's, but generally speaking these are meant to be separate models within the Audi family.  Besides, Audi will soon be rolling out the B9 A4's which will, probably, crank up both the L and the P (and the price) further differentiating the A3 and A4 lines. Mercedes, BMW, Acura, Lexus and Infiniti will almost certainly do the same thing. Well, I think Mercedes already has with the new C class compared to the new CLA class.  In any case, there needs to be a place to go to discuss the cars that would appear to be competitive with each other. Yes, I guess it is possible for someone to shop for an ILX and drive out with a TLX SH-AWD Advance, just as it is possible to look at a 328 and drive out with a 335ix -- but, using the auto magazine comparison test reports as guides, it would be more typical for the A4 to be tested against the 3 series or the C class not the A3 tested against the C class and 3 series, etc.  My head hurts."
2699,"March 25, 2015 10:06PM",stickguy,"so split out compact entry level and mid-size entry level. still within the EL family, but recognizes different size, mission and competitiors.  ILX/A3/CLA/BMW 1 class (when it arrives) would be compacts. Heck, could maybe slot in a top line Jetta! Oh wait, that is an A3... The ATS goes here too.  the ""mid size"" (probably a bad term) are the A4, 3 series (320/328), Volvo, TLX, Infiniti, MB C class, etc.  To further mess with your head, I don't count the HiPo models as entry level. Call them HP compact/mid-size entry level. that would be the S3/S4, M3, etc.  seems logical to me. And I don't see a problem having a couple of groupings in the entry level category. The all fit the basic criteria: A premium model, with sporting pretenses and reasonable performance to back it up, and a decent level of luxury features. Basically a step up from your basic family sedans or small cars.  and yes, just like with compact to midsize family sedans, there is cross-over in content, performance and price. You can load up an A3 to be fancier and more expensive than an A4, and absolutely people can cross-shop them. same with ILX to TLX,. Still within the ELLPS family.  I put the CTS. E class, 5 series, etc. in the next class up. I think you called them LPS (sans EL) which seems quite reasonable.  Hey, this makes sense to me."
2700,"March 23, 2015 11:29PM",markcincinnati,"Perhaps these cars that we talk about that are in this broad broad category should be called Compact LPS, but also it might make sense to call them mid-size? Entry level and the LP designation if price is the current meaning of EL would seem to be an oxymoron -- and, if price is the meaning of EL, today, where do A3's, to name one, go? Do we ""rationalize"" the naming according to price? The Audi lineup (to name the one I am most familiar with) is A3 (and Q3), A4/A5 (and Q5), A6/A7 (and Q7). The characteristics of these that stands out first is size -- and as the cars get larger, in the progression the price does indeed escalate. But, prior to the current A3, the Audi A4/A5/S4/S5/RS5 were the ""entry level"" cars in the line. They were of a common, more or less, wheelbase length and the other notable characteristics that shared the theme were length and width -- size.  The part that conveys the cost factor is the amount of the content of Land P and a ""certain something"" that somehow we all understand, but like the word ""quality"" is a bit more difficult to define. A Chevy with a 110"" wheelbase is not a member of the ELLPS club. A BMW 3 series, no matter how tarted up or down, however, is.  If the bothersome two letters are EL, well that is beyond our capabilities to modify. These are smaller LPS cars, and generally they cost less than their LPS counter parts. That, I think, is why a strippie 3 and a fully loaded 335 are both ELLPS cars."

I think as long as it hits the pricepoint, it counts. So if that includes more than 1 model from a manufacturer, so be it. Reason being that not all manufacturers have more than 1 model. So just because Volvo doesn't have something smaller than the S60 at the moment, that shouldn't put the others at a disadvantage because they can only put their subcompacts up against it. I also think the price, if positioned properly, excludes the true mid-sizers such as the CTS, 5-series, E-class, and A6."
2709,"March 24, 2015  3:53PM",markcincinnati,"If pricepoint, not size + L+P, is the determining factor for inclusion in this class or nomenclature, can we safely assume that the base price of the base model is ""whatever it is"" and that all modifications to that price based on ""options and packages"" are included in the mix? This, then, means we still have to have some way to account for the ""L"" and ""P"" of the cars (and of course the L+P add both content and cost, even to the base).  Perhaps we can then say that a base 3 series and a fully-optioned 335 are both ELLPS cars because they both start out at a price point of $X.  My car, today, is at the Audi dealer for its 25,000 service interval. Since the dealer has a policy of ""trying"" to match the loaner they provide with the car in for service, I was provided with an S4 for the day. The thing has 1,800 miles on it and is Misano Red Pearl in color (this color is a $500 option); the car also has the B&O sound system upgrade and blind spot monitoring. As a loaner, it also happens to be one equipped with the S-tronic (dual clutch) automatic transmission.  I consider this car below what I would think almost anyone, today, would go for -- but the dealer general manager says no, this car is EXACTLY the base model from a practical perspective, because ""they can't sell"" a version without some level of equipment above ""book"" entry level (what I would call a true stippie).  Indeed, since the car does not have MMI, it will probably only sell because it will -- eventually -- come out of the loaner fleet and be subject to very heavy off MSRP discounting. The ""on the lot"" cars virtually all have MMI+, those that don't were probably ordered specifically without nav with the dealer knowing they would end up in the loaner fleet.  You may or may not chafe at the nearly $3,500 price tag for the MMI+ system, but the take up of that option is, apparently, nearly universal, as is S-Tronic. Yet, sitting on the showroom floor there are a couple of A4's (and one of them, too, is nav-less); I would argue that the base price of these Junior-LPS cars is rarely seen by the actual buyers, since most folks do, typically, go for the ""popular"" option group.  I must note, too, that one reason for the majority going with the popular option groups and/or packages is that the lease calculations FAVOR the high-content variants over the maxed out variants and the strippie variants. Some car-actuary has figured out what will retain the highest residual -- and that, these days, is medium to medium high loaded.  So, if price, not size, is to be the rule of the day, I would have to submit that the price range of cars that fit the bill of ELLPS must be on the order of $39,999 to $69,999; after all it is possible to start out with a BMW 328 ""Walmart"" (or TJ Max) version and max out at a 335ix ""Bespoke"" (so to speak) and spend tens of thousands crossing the chasm from pauper to prince."
2710,"March 24, 2015  5:15PM",dino001,"You forgot about 320i, Mark - even more ""pauper"" version, but according to some here, still spunky enough for their taste. I don't think less than 200 hp is such a problem, if the car is still dynamic enough, so I'd add it. In fact, I'd say that one would be something like ""entry level of entry level"""
2711,"March 24, 2015  5:47PM",qbrozen," Eh, I really gotta argue for a max on base price, as you said in the first paragraph above, not range of max pricing, be the deciding factor. Otherwise, you open the door to comparison of a CTS Vsport to a base 320i, for example, as 2 ELLPS cars. Whatever it maxes out to should be largely irrelevant since different people want different options. I'm thinking either $40k or $45k as the max base price. The $45k would allow for the 335i and V6 ATS, but it would allow in the S3. The $40k would exclude the S3 but also limit the group to the 4-cyl models of the aforementioned compacts. Either pricepoint excludes the mid-sizers. I could argue either way, honestly."
2712,"March 24, 2015  5:55PM",breld, Makes sense - particularly to the extent AWD or RWD is considered a requirement for the segment.
2713,"March 24, 2015  6:05PM",breld,"As for the criteria for what belongs in this segment (and the fact that there is no hard and fast answer is what makes this a fun discussion), how about the manufacturers' intention?  They make it pretty clear what vehicles are the intended competition, or which ones were used as benchmarks. If those include the 3-series, A4 and/or C-class, I'd say it's in the segment. Whether or not they compete well in the segment is a separate argument."
2714,"March 24, 2015  6:08PM",markcincinnati,"I stand corrected ANY 3XX denomination or derivative that keeps the L+P (and the 320 qualifies) does belong.  Of course, that being said, the range ($) is now slightly broader.  E.G,  320i Sedan 320i xDrive Sedan 328i Sedan 328i xDrive Sedan 328d Sedan 328d xDrive Sedan 335i Sedan 335i xDrive Sedan  Even:  328i xDrive Sports Wagon 328d xDrive Sports Wagon  And:  ActiveHybrid 3  Finally @ the top o' the BMW ELLPS pyramid, the :  M3 Sedan  And we now have rounded out the range of BMW's ELLPS offerings. I suspect we would exclude the X3, since it is technically in the Premium-SUV (or in BMW-speak SAV) class of vehicles, even though it is based on the 3.  The range, then (in base MSRP) is:  $32,950 - $62,000, not that you could with much certainty even find a ""base"" version (without special ordering it).  Just for grins: With most options/packages selected, BUT with zero (no) performance options selected, and keeping the car as a 320i RWD Sedan (not ix as more than half of them are configured) a 320i, optioned thusly has an MSRP of $47,325.  My suspicion is that ""no one"" will option a 320i to $47,325 (and if they do and select ZERO performance options from the order-sheet, that would be even harder to imagine); at that point on the food chain they will, see what could be had with the ""28"" option added and a few of the ""L"" options subtracted; and hey, we're at the dealership anyway, ""ya got any 335's we could test drive?""  Remember -- assuming a Cincinnati BMW dealer speaks for the US dealer body, generally -- most of these cars are leased and when sub-venting comes into play and ""fill-in-the-blank"" luxury and/or performance option or package or both are offered up for another $30 a month, well frugal shoppers turn into fanciful buyers.  I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but my data point would be to note: ""most"" ELLPS shoppers don't go from whatever they used to drive to an ELLPS to give up such things as Bluetooth phone and audio integration, a backup camera and parking sensors and many other ""we take them for granted"" features they had in their nicely equipped Accords, Camrys, Nissans, and Passats just for the snob appeal (if there is any) of driving an Audi, BMW, Lexus or Mercedes.  Case in point, again: The loaner Audi S4 (@$52,200) I have today doesn't have a backup camera, park assist or bluetooth iphone audio integration-- who, in the wide, wide world of sports would spend (or expect to spend) that kind of cheese and not get a backup camera, etc? If my maximum spending ability prevented me from having these ""essentials,"" I assure you I would not look at a German, I'd go Asian or American and probably not be looking at the ELLPS class. Hyundai Genesis anyone?"
2715,"March 24, 2015  6:28PM",qbrozen,"Once again, an M3 is not entry-level by any stretch of the imagination. Nobody is spending $60k thinking ""yeah, this is entry-level.""  And, if it does count, then so do the 5-series, E-class, and even XF."
2716,"March 24, 2015  6:32PM",dino001," It will be $50K soon. 335i has now starting price of just squeaking below $45K cap, guess what it will be next year. 435 is already above $45K, both coupe and grand coupe. So, unless we disregard naming convention and not recognize 4-series as a separate model, we would have to be prepared for another price escalation. Also C400 is already above $45K.  Based on a quick look, it seems the top versions of those Germans are pricing themselves out of this segment: S4 starts at $48K, S5 is $52K, C400 sedan is $48K, I'm sure the next generation coupe will me more. It's almost like there is forming a separate segment of ""entry level plus luxury sports sedans"", however oxymoronic it sounds, slotting itself in high 40s/low 50s base pricing, with options running up to $70K. One could add R-Design trim of Volvo S60 and ATS 3.6. One could easily make an argument for adding IS350 F and some may want to add top TLX, but I don't know about that. This segment would be distinguished by elevated performance bolted on essentially the same frame of their basic versions. Some additional differentiations by unique colors, interior versions, or other aesthetic treatments will separate those trims further.  Then M3/4 and RS4/5 with (future C AMG) could be called ""high performance compact luxury sports sedans"". ATS-V, if finally released, will surely be aspiring to that club. This segment will mean not only separate special engines, but special solutions related to suspension, weight reduction, chassis design modifications made specifically to support the performance. They'll usually have their own colors, increased comfort features, special interior touches, on much higher level of differentiation then models above. They are in fact, their own models. Call them ""poor man's supercars""."
2717,"March 24, 2015  6:49PM",nyccarguy,"""$69,999""  No way anything with a 6 in front of it should qualify as ""entry level."""
2718,"March 24, 2015  6:59PM",dino001," I agree. I think it's again in eye of the beholder. Those making middle six-digits (not millionaires, but elite professionals) have a completely different view on entry level luxury than those making $80K-$120K, looking for a premium ride that won't break their finances. Something nice, well above average, with this sporty slant, but within reasonable means. Mark says he can't even imagine lack of backup camera - I don't have it, I do have audible warning system with a colored map picture. I like leather on mine, but wouldn't dismiss those who like that fake stuff - apparently local Mercedes Benz dealers stock only those on their CLA, C, GLA class and even some of E-class. If people buy it, so be it.  I know if I were making twice the money I do today, I'd still be buying compact/midsize, but M4/3 or RS would likely make my list. And in that parallel universe, I'd probably think it's still ""entry level""."

So from one side saying that $70K+ M3 is an ""Entry Level"" , to another being completely in denial on how much prices rose in last 20 years ($40K ""all in"" won't even buy you sport suspension on some of those ""performance sedans""). Then somebody else says A3 is not ""good enough"" for the luxury part of the definition. Classic eat the cake and have it, too.  As I wrote before, to me ELLPS doesn't exists anymore. Its original purveyors (3-series, A4, C-class) moved on to chase higher sales volumes from people with thicker wallets, their imitators moved into those leftover niches, but with their own philosophies and the category was stretched and fragmented.  Basically, any given version of those original brand cars has to lose one of the letters. Their true sports luxury versions are no longer entry level, as they cost easily over $50K, sometimes even $60K, their ""entry sports"" versions lack some features found in $15K Kia or Hyundai, which makes one wonder about the luxury part. The market fragmented into too many sections and subsections for that category to be distinct. Anything that size now can fit.  The closest model to true ELLPS in last 10 years, IMHO, was probably Infiniti G50, especially in its first couple of generations. The engine and suspension made it ""performance"", pricing made it ""entry level"", standard leather and other stuff made it luxury. I'm not saying it was the best car for the money, but I think it was closest to the definition of that category."

I pulled up the Car and Driver test of that car and compared it to their test of an M235i manual. The E90 sedan is three inches longer and weighs only 24 pounds more. The E90 also has a bit better F/R weight distribution- 51/49 as opposed to 52/48 for the F22. Standing start and in-gear acceleration times are virtually identical(and adequately quick). The M235i holds a slight edge in steady state cornering and braking, which I'm virtually certain is due to the E90 wearing Bridgestone Potenza RE050A I RFTs and the F22 being fitted with ""go flat"" Michelin Pilot Super Sports- I can vouch for the Michelins; I run 225/45-18 PSS on my Mazdaspeed 3 as my summer/track tire and I always run out of courage before I run out of grip.

I imagine one would have to parse each manufacturer to determine which model is their ""entry level."" And, then is it luxury and performance DNA? For example, in my distant outpost in the universe known as ""Jaguar,"" I drive the current entry level Jag, the XF. Is it entry level by definition here? Well, if E, 5, and A6 variants are, then yes. IMHO, it certainly has luxury and performance, but is never mentioned here. And, a few years ago, would a BMW 3 really be ""luxury?"" Mercedes Benz was luxury, BMW covered performance and perhaps Audi was the only marque that could be included here, combining luxury and sport.

2744,"March 23, 2015  6:11PM",stickguy,"Well, 10 years ago it was probably the 328i and g35 as the definitive examples. So extrapolate that and see what you get!"
2745,"March 23, 2015  6:14PM",dino001,"""Entry Level Luxury"" in this forum and others usually implied not in a lineup of the maker, but versus wallets of the potential buyers. Those ""ELL"" basically meant ""premium brand plus some, but not all latest premium features"". Something, midlevel professional with decent job could afford, as long as they didn't buy too big house, or didn't have too many other obligations. They also limited the size of the vehicle. The old X-type from Jag was in that category, but they withdrew from that market completely and now cater to what I would call ""full premium to upscale"" segment with a performance skew into it. Those sometimes were called LPS, or ""Luxury Performance Sedans""."
2746,"March 23, 2015  6:18PM",dino001," So the question remains - did the segment move with the car models, or did the segment stayed where it is, and the models ""moved out"" of it. The former means ELLPS is now $45-$60K on the sticker, bigger in size, softer, less raw, more luxury. The latter means the ""founders"" don't qualify today by either being too expensive, too big, too soft, or all of the above. I'm sure there will be plenty of arguments both ways."
2747,"March 23, 2015  6:34PM",qbrozen,"personally, I would say its an ""either/or"" kind of statement.

I'm just throwing a number out there for starters, but the idea is that, for example, Jag's XF was previously their lowest car, and with a starting point of $50k, it doesn't qualify as ""entry level."""
2748,"March 23, 2015  6:55PM",roadburner,"Since the weather has improved I've been driving the 2002 and 318ti on a more regular basis. For me it is interesting and fun to experience the entry level Bimmers of 40 and 20 years ago.  My first BMW was a 1973 Bavaria 3.0 that my girlfriend-now wife of 29 years-found for me back in 1983, so when I bought the '02 by accident(long story) on eBay in 2008 it really was like going home again. The 2002 is lightweight yet feels solid; all the controls are reasonably direct and the 2 liter four does it's best- but with only 100 bhp it can only do so much. Aside from an Alpine AM/FM/CD?Sirius XM head unit all the modifications on my car are period correct-E21 Recaros, Weber 32/36, Delta CD ignition, Bosch Red Coil, Bilstein HDs-so the original character of the car shines through. Even with a direct top gear it easily cruises at 80+. Grip is good but body roll can be unsettling to those used to modern levels of roll stiffness. Still, I could easily see myself using a 1973 tii(with a five speed retrofit, rotary A/C compressor, and a decent head unit/speakers) as a daily driver. No, an E10 is most definitely not for everyone, but for those it speaks to, it is a revelation.  I consider the E36/5 ti to be ""The Last '02"" since it was the final BMW four seat coupe fitted with a semi-trailing arm suspension and a naturally aspirated four cylinder. Unlike the 2002, the ti is much more suitable to use as an entertaining(and economical) daily driver. It has a great HVAC system, adequate power(with a Turner/Conforti chip, at any rate), ABS, and front airbags. The only things I really miss(besides 100 extra bhp) are heated seats and wheel mounted audio controls. It weighs in some 550 pounds less than a 228i- and is 10 inches shorter. When BMW Individual was building my Club Sports they tried to make me take the ""optional"" sunroof but my salesperson stepped up and thus my car was built without a hole in the roof. For me, the car is just about perfect; light, nimble, and a ball to drive. The M42 engine does not suffer lazy driving; if you don't like keeping an engine ""on the boil"" than this definitely isn't your car. And on a winding road what shines through is the car's lack of mass. I've been reading how Mazda's new Miata will weigh close to what a 1994 Miata weighed. It would be nice if BMW started making weight reduction more of a priority. Speaking of vehicle weight, did you know that US safety standards require that the front airbags, side curtain airbags, and interior be designed to protect an unbelted 160 pound male? That's ridiculous, every state has a mandatory seat belt law, so safety systems should be engineered to protect properly restrained occupants. I'd think that would allow a significant reduction in weight and complexity. And anyway, at some point we need to let the Law of Natural Selection take its course."
2749,"March 23, 2015  6:57PM",m6user,"I've always considered ELLPS to mean a luxury automaker's entry level car in the performance category, not what is entry level dollarwise for someone's pocketbook. How could anyone possibly define that?"
2750,"March 23, 2015  7:22PM",markcincinnati,"$45K UPPER limit for ELLPS? I would think that the number $45 is closer to the lower limit. If we're going to say that the car should have a STARTING price of $X, well there are a lot of cars that virtually no one buys that do indeed start at $38,995, but typically go out the door at least at $5K-$8K more.  I would think we're talking about a particular family of vehicles and that if we really mean LPS (as part of the acronym ELLPS), well you are indeed speaking of the entire family of 3 series from the lowest MSRP version (totally stripped, but, virtually never sold that way) all the way to the fully loaded M3. Where else would you put the M3 if not ELLPS? And, for that matter where would you put the ""typical"" 335 if not ELLPS, it certainly isn't going to fit in with the LPS cars (where the 5 series family inhabits).  $45K - $65K does cover about the widest range for all the cars that are generally considered in the ELLPS family. The thing that seems likely to make the number beginning with the ""$4"" as the bottom line number is the inclusion of the L & P, there are plenty of ""S"" (sedans) out there that can be had for $45K at the upper limit, but they are generally not going to be invited into the ""LP"" club. I would assume that Cadillac actually would begrudge a Regal (a Regal GS) the key to the ELLPS washroom, if the comparison is between the Regal and the ATS. Cadillac probably wants the ATS (all variants) in the ELLPS class and the CTS in the LPS class these days. Buick, based on the test reports of the LSS (Luxury Sport Sedan) Regal GS (starting at $40,195), I would think the Regal ""family"" can probably qualify. Where it becomes a bit dicey is that the bottom of the line model probably would be considered to be quite a bit less full of the ""P"" and the ""S"" of the bottom of the line ATS. And the middle child ATS can easily swim upstream to an MSRP of $55K+ without breaking a sweat.  The point, to repeat, is that the EL apparently seems, more than anything else, to represent the size of the vehicle; but the LP seems to classify the vehicle based on both luxury content and performance abilities. The range, I would think doesn't top out at $45K, frankly it probably starts north of $40K and keeps on going well into the $60's and as long as they are utilizing the same underwear (thinking of the base 3 series BMW at the bottom and the M3 at the top), going all the way into the $70s certainly isn't that much of a stretch.  This is the best range of cars, features and costs there is, methinks.

2751,"March 23, 2015  8:06PM",qbrozen,"i really think you gotta have that base price exclude any variants. An m3 does not belong here, IMHO. It is far from ""entry level."" So, for example, you could include both the 320 and 328 because, per my own made up criteria above, they both fall under the $40k base price cap. And by that same reasoning, you can exclude smaller top-spec cars such as the CLA AMG and S3.  I mean, we aren't talking option packages here. These are different models with their own base prices."
2752,"March 23, 2015  8:06PM",stickguy,"Dino, I think that as some of the old time models ""grew up"" (outgrew the segment?) the smaller models came in underneath to replace them. Pretty sure that an A3 is roughly the size (and mission) of the A4 from a couple of generations ago. And would not be surprised if the ILX is close to the original TSX. BMW though has not (as far as I recall) grown the 3 as much, but they are sliding the 2 in that slot, just not a 4 door."
2753,"March 23, 2015  8:14PM",dino001," Oh yes, they did. Quite a bit. Current 3-series is much bigger than mine, which in turn was much bigger then previous one. 15 years ago the 5-series was EPA classified as ""compact"". Today, it would be hard to classify the 3 series as such."
2754,"March 23, 2015  8:29PM",stickguy,"Good to know. I knew it did creep up, but did not realize it was that much.  same thing in the normal sedan class. A Civic today is the size of an Accord from a few generations ago."
2755,"March 23, 2015  8:57PM",markcincinnati,"My buddy has a very nice, well equipped BMW 5 series (circa 2003). It is probably equal to or maybe even a tiny bit smaller than a current 3 series.  Where do the ""more expensive"" versions of a model go if not here -- a 335 or an S4 are certainly very very similar, dimension wise to the 3XX and A4 variant from whose loins they sprung, eh?  EL is, today, a size or internal designation (not price); LPS indicates Luxury (which adds cost and sometimes great cost) and Performance (which adds costs and sometimes ooober cost). I cross shopped an A4 Prestige with most options with an S4 Premium+ with three options, because they were ""within reach"" of each other financially. I did not cross shop a maxed out A4 Sline with an RS5 (sorry there is no RS4), but had there been one to choose from, I presume I would still have considered the RS4 as an ELLPS since there is no way someone would confuse it with an A6, S6 or RS6 (or RS7 in the case of this line, since the RS6 isn't imported to the US).  The sales rep I deal with told me he had ""quite a lot"" of S4's coming off lease (that would be the ones prior to the V6 supercharged version, i.e, V8's) and that a number of these customers just couldn't fathom getting an A5 class without a V8, so they went with an RS5 rather than sticking with an S5.  In this class of cars, I think folks look at the size of the vehicle and determine if ""this is the size car I see myself driving"", then they begin with packages, options and accessories until they have the car customized to their liking.  A fully optioned A4 2.0T Prestige with optional features is very close in price to a somewhat less decked out S4, hence my consideration of both. I assume BMW shoppers do the same thing -- they go in for the 328 and trick one out with the option sheet and then test drive a 335 with a few less options and say, ""I'm going to stick with the EL (size) but forego a bit of L for a dose of P in my 3 series Sedan. Happens all the time.  My wife -- set on a Q5 3.0T Premium Plus with about 4 additional options -- test drove an SQ5.  Katie, bar the door -- the 3.0T was super nice -- but the Performance of the SQ was intoxicating.  She did not, however, cross shop with a Q7 or a Q3 -- she wanted the size first, performance second and luxury third. Some folks probably switch second and third -- but there is a cost regardless.  Know too, that some folks (my wife included) checked out the Q5 2.0T first and was ""this close"" to the buy, until she test drove the 3.0T and was ""this close"" until she test drove the SQ, and so it goes.  We choose not to afford a Macaan Turbo (which was close to $90K comparably equipped), but within the family, the choice was Q5 2.0T all the way to the SQ5 with the OMG engine."
2756,"March 23, 2015  9:20PM",qbrozen," I wholeheartedly disagree. An entry-level job is salary-dependent, as is an entry-level house. Why should an entry-level vehicle not follow suit? If the grouping were dependent on size, the title would use car size classification and it would be called ""Compact Luxury Performance Sedans."""

If there wasn't a market for those cars the Miata, the Boxster/Cayman, the CTS V/V Sport, the GTI, the 2 Series, and the M3/4- to name just a few-would be dying on the vine. I do think BMW knows exactly what it is doing- forcing the enthusiasts to move up the food chain to get cars that actually feel like a BMW from just five years ago. A few months ago I discussed this same issue with Jamie Kitman of Automobile And Sam Smith of Road and Track, and both agreed that it is more than a bit cynical to make customers pay extra in order to get a BMW that drives like a BMW should.  I suppose the question should be, ""What makes a BMW a BMW? If the roundel and the Hofmeister kink become the only things that distinguish a BMW from other cars, Munich will eventually pay the price."

I know my wife for instance DOES NOT like driving her Pilot. She does maybe 12K per year. I'm sure once her truck is paid for in a few years and the principle is paid down on my Legacy, she's going to want something.

I used to frequent this forum ages ago, but just haven't found my way over here for awhile.  Nice discussion on BMWs - old and new.  As many of you know from the CCBA forum, I've had 3 5-series (and 5 3-series - isn't that funny? ) - an E39, an E60 and most recently, an F30. The E39 and E60 were manual transmissions - a 2002 530i sport and a 2007 530xi. Loved both - still miss and regret a bit giving up the E39. I don't have the experience or knowledge to speak intelligently about what makes such a car feel the way it does (like @roadburner and others here), but I do ""get it.""  I went into the F10 knowing what it was, and what it wasn't. I certainly wasn't expecting anything like the E39. I loved the styling (particularly with the M-sport package), the pull of the engine (535i) and the comfortable and luxurious ride. In the relatively short time I had it, I appreciated those attributes for my long commute.  But, alas, my yearning for something with more feel to it (not to mention the manual transmission), won out and I bought my Mazda3 a couple weeks ago.  The look on my friends and co-workers' faces when I say I traded in my BMW for the Mazda is priceless. They're used to me trading out cars on a regular basis, but this switch just has them speechless. I kind of have my response down pat at this point - ""I appreciate all kinds of cars, and was missing a sportier feel, manual...etc. etc."" They feel better when I say I already have my next BMW picked out, but need to wait a couple years for it to come down in price."

The first level that you can basically read through the car's OBC, the second that requires the dealer's proprietary equipment, and a 3rd that only regional reps can access. Even with what they could read, the car had been logging all instances of boost going beyond stock limits. He was pretty sure the regional rep could get much more detailed info than that.  After they read the car, he came right back and said ""OK, so you obviously have a tune. Which one?"" D'oh!! But, like I said, he was cool about it."

Audi A4/S4, allroad, and possibly the Q/SQ 5 derivatives and this includes anything under the heading B8 (and soon to be B9 designation); can't figure out if the A3/S3 has any halo effect, yet, that would allow it to be included.

Just because a car has a bunch of electronic bells and whistles and stitching on cheap leather doesn't make it a luxury brand.  Many cars are luxurious to a degree but it doesn't make the brand a luxury brand.  Most people don't perceive Hyundai and Kia to be equal to Chevy or Ford let alone be considered a luxury brand.  Granted, they may be equal to Chevy and Ford at this point but the majority perception IMO doesn't put them there.  Perception is reality in the world we live in.

2779,"March 21, 2015  4:48PM",graphicguy,"There's a confluence of car brands that are starting to blur the lines of ELLS.  Where previously, it was defined by a 3 series, BMW has been attacked on all sides with worthy (and sometimes better) competitors. Throw in the C Class and A4 for good measure.  Can you really say that a Dodge Charger with a honkin' Hemi with probably the best GPS in the biz, real leather, all the safety gizmos on the planet can't really be considered a compettor to an M3? Just because the Dodge is less expensive, does that mean it isn't built as well, using as good or better materials than the German rivals? It seems Mercedes is trying to convince everyone that their vinyl is somehow superior to leather. Nice try, but I've felt it, smelled it, sat on/in it. It's not as good as leather, regardless of what the marketers say.  I think it's expanded. Buick could sneak in there.  Acura TLX? Sure. ILX? Debateable. Q50? Yep. Q40? Well, that's just a renamed G, which is well past its expiration date.  Lexus IS? Why not? ES? Sure. NX? CT? Not so sure about those last two.  ATS? That's the ELLPS darline right now, so that's definitely in.  A4\S4...Yep!  A6/CTS/E Class/5 Series? Probably slotted above any of those that have already been mentioned.

There is nothing about the ES that could even remotely be called ""performance"" if the assumption includes the ability to (quoting my wife) ""go like a snake in a rat hole."" The ES can't even go like the rat in the metaphor if you axe me.  The possible reason for [my] not including some of the cars in the fold is that they don't offer much ""L"" or ""P"" or not enough to notice. The Buick Regal, was an oversight on my part -- since it can be somewhat low on the P side, but so can an A4 or a 3 series -- I do think the ATS is a better GM example of something that can be included as a full on ELLPS, but I think I will give the Regal at least the designation as a Near-ELLPS.  The action, today, does seem to be in the realm of things that can be called ELLPS or NELLPS -- sure there are better Luxury cars and better Performance cars than those that fit into the universe of ELLPS offerings; but if you have a $45K-$65K car-buying budget, your choices are both deep and wide in the ELLPS designation.  Since LPS cars, these days, seem to have a plus size requirement, I am less and less tempted by the LPS models out there. I do wish my S4 was a bit bigger, but the A6 occupies just way too much real estate these days. I am hopeful the next gen B's from Audi (B9) figure out how to be about 10% bigger overall.

It's not for everyone- Taruffi uses lots of equations and diagrams to illustrate basic and advanced driving principles. On the lighter side, the vintage pictures of F1 and sports car races at various tracks are entertaining as well. And as far as driver safety goes, things have moved on a bit, as there is some discussion of leather helmets as well as the pros and cons of wearing seat belts in an open car.

I'll tell you why  Some idiot in a Lexus RX 350 sidelined my 4-month old S4 by darting out of a parking lot (in an apparent left turn at exactly the wrong moment when I was going straight; colliding his front left with my front right).  He sidelined my S4 with less than a month to go for a track weekend, a track weekend I didn't want to miss being that I had missed the previous one with the club for other reasons.  Hertz (insurance rental) didn't do me any favors, in fact, they pretty much sabotaged my plans, and nearly (after over 3 weeks advance warning and notice) put me in a Buick Lacrosse. Given the choice between a Camaro RS V6 and the Buick, well, it was no choice at all. Really, they should have saved the C250 Benz for me. Most people at the track said a Focus would have been more fun to drive. I didn't end up having much fun, as the Camaro is too heavy. Next time I'll specify a Focus."

It's closest, anyway, to what a BMW 5 series was 30 years ago, except it's a lot safer and has less steering feel.. MSRP in white with Sensatec comes to $33.9k."

I probably will, eventually, maybe even sooner than later, as my car is going out of warranty in six months and I also like some of the aspects of this new 435i GC, but I'm just not nearly as enthusiastic, as I should be - and the one chief reason is that steering. Every time I get into it and back into my car, I just can't believe how much they messed it up.  BTW, it's not about the car not going, where it needs to - it actually does, quite well. Probably all the electronics help it correct when you turn the wheel too much. But it's like a video game, not a real car.

You fought hard (as you should have) to have your car rebuilt back to Ingolstat factory specs as was the right thing to do given that it was 4 months old and still brand new.  Now insurance covers a rental vehicle for usually a set amount $30/ day or $50/ day. That is going to pretty much get you whatever car they want to give you. Now I know for a fact, as others have said here that most rental car companies have some sort of premium collection or dream collection that would have allowed you to rent a BMW, MB, Porsche, Corvette for a premium over the $30 or $50 per day. I don't think it is reasonable to expect an insurance company to provide you with a car to be raced on a track. I also don't think it is reasonable to expect a V6 powered Camaro with an Automatic transmission (from a rental fleet no less) to perform at any level other than a pace car on the track. I could be wrong (it happens a lot) and truth be told, I've never taken any of my cars to the track.

An extreme example is found at my local dealer, which still has one last 2013 (!) Genesis, which I think is a demo. Not surprisingly, they are offering a huge discount on it of almost $11,000. They are also offering $8k off msrp on some 2014s. The 2013 is a fully loaded Genesis 5.0 V-8 ""R-spec"" model with all the options, and it can be yours for just $37k.

2806,"March 19, 2015  4:31PM",andres3,"Now insurance covers a rental vehicle for usually a set amount $30/ day or $50/ day. That is going to pretty much get you whatever car they want to give you. Now I know for a fact, as others have said here that most rental car companies have some sort of premium collection or dream collection that would have allowed you to rent a BMW, MB, Porsche, Corvette for a premium over the $30 or $50 per day. I don't think it is reasonable to expect an insurance company to provide you with a car to be raced on a track. I also don't think it is reasonable to expect a V6 powered Camaro with an Automatic transmission (from a rental fleet no less) to perform at any level other than a pace car on the track.

Although I did recently have all the necessary fluids (oil, brake, trans, differential) fluid along with new front pads and rotors changed on my wife's 2011 Pilot. Maybe I should bring it up to LR and see what it can do:)  I don't carry rental insurance given the limitations and lack of use it would receive from me. This was a 3rd party claim, and the 3rd party insurance is obligated (legally arguable, but I think I'd win in court) a ""like"" vehicle. A like Vehicle to the S4 would be an M3, C63 AMG, 335is, ATS-V, cTS-V. Usually those vehicles command $$$$$ to rent.  Given the guy was underinsured, I was warned to mitigate my costs, and so I settled on a ""premium"" rental at $38/day. Given it was Hertz's insurance side, there's like an electric fence between insurance rentals and the exotic sport or whatever they want to call them rentals. Apparently, insurance companies don't believe you should be given a ""like"" vehicle unless ""like"" just means in size. Either that, or they don't believe premium sports cars are ever involved in accidents  I was willing to pay lots MORE for an upgrade for the 3 days I needed it for the track weekend. I even agreed to pay $75 extra per day (of my own money in addition to the base agreement) over 3 weeks before the event, and still, they couldn't come up with anything worthy. They claimed the C250 was $75/day, but when I needed it, it wasn't available. Hertz is incompetent.  Next time I'll just make another contract with another company and let the $38/day car sit idle for 3 days."
2807,"March 19, 2015  4:50PM",dino001," It's not as simple. Generally, ""like"" vehicle does exactly mean size and arguably some comfort feature content, one could also argue for safety, but that's about it. The other party liability should do reasonable effort to allow you maintaining your lifestyle without much disruption, so if your lifestyle includes some leisure activities requiring driving, then they should in theory compensate for that, but I doubt any jury or court would be too sympathetic for weekend going 100+ mph somewhere. Moreover, are you really insured for going on track in your own contract? I'd check that, if I were you - if you hit something or somebody during such an event, you may be unpleasantly surprised by exclusion on your own insurance contract. So, if you are not even insured for that under your own contract, I can see the liable party easily weasel out of their obligation, at least their insurance. Perhaps you could sue the actual party, but good luck with that, too. It would surely do for an interesting legal precedent."
2808,"March 19, 2015  4:53PM",nyccarguy," ""but to me base BMW 320i with the 6 speed manual and few or no options seems somewhat appealing""  I agree, but if you are going to go that route, you might as well go for a 328i with the extra hp/torque so at least your car is fast. You'll also have to special order something like that and wait 12 weeks for it. Or you could do European delivery..."
2809,"March 19, 2015  9:31PM",flightnurse, The 320i has been dynoed and it was putting 180 to RW... This was done by Terry at BMS. Then add the BMS Stage1 which add's 3 lbs of boost you are talking about 220 RW. Right about where the 328i is at.

2811,"March 20, 2015  2:16AM",nyccarguy,@flightnurse - add the BMS Stage 1 which gets you 3 psi more boost & a voided warranty. Advantage 328i
2812,"March 20, 2015  3:14AM",markcincinnati,"  The fact that I -- to this day -- love manual transmissions and that you ""and others on the more enthusiastic side"" like the ""quality"" that the car under discussion possesses (an older model BMW) makes us, perhaps, nothing more than sentimental, not necessarily correct in our critiques. ""It used to be better when -- fill in the blank -- was the rule of the day,"" is a perspective. It is, apparently, a perspective that is no longer a prudent point of view, however.  The reason is, of course, that BMW and all the other successful brands are doing everything, perhaps anything they can to retain and gain market share. I do believe that today's buyers are actually as enthusiastic, perhaps more so than those of yesteryear. Actually saying that and seeing it in ""print"" is very difficult, but I do believe it is true.  If, on the other hand, the companies that progressively and steadily abandon manual transmissions, steering feel and all the other things we unintentional (and unaware and in denial) Luddites rail on about (when we speak about the good old days from a position on high) somehow all fail, well then we can say ""I told you so.""  Look at the income statements (where and when they are available) of these companies -- if revenue goes up after some period of time after the manual transmission is more or less abandoned, etc, well there is at the very least a strong correlation that those of us who decry the current in favor of the past, are wrong.  As I recognize (and usually don't much care for) about myself: I am often wrong, but never uncertain.  We need to embrace the changes -- I would venture to guess that many, probably most of the changes we complain about are for the better.  Of course, I am certain.  Of course."
2813,"March 20, 2015  5:56AM",flightnurse," Brad, it does void the warranty, and when you write info like that without having first hand knowledge only adds more issues."

2815,"March 20, 2015 12:43PM",rayainsw,"Since I decided against an S3 a while back, I have rarely been to this forum. As usual, I find Markcincinnati’s posts thought-provoking. He mentions BMW [ I had one ] ‘the good old days’ [ I was there ] and steering feel, among other things.  I decided this time around to select a 2015 Dodge Charger R/T with Premium package. I will waste no time trying to fit this vehicle into whatever y’all have decided is the current definition of the ELLPS category. [ It certainly has a level of Luxury and Performance – and it is a Sedan. ]  I did look at & drive BMWs [ M235i ] and the S3 [ really nice ] but decided not to go that way, this time.  The focus and the execution of the Dodge is quite different than those models typically discussed here. It DOES, however, have good steering feel [ IMHO - electric assist, but well done ] and with the 5.7L V8, it has a very ‘good old days’ feel to the acceleration.  I will leave it there, for now – and check in periodically. Perhaps next time, I will be in the market for an ELLPS.  - Ray Seduced by the Hemi’s TQ this time around . . ."
2816,"March 20, 2015 12:47PM",nyccarguy," This is true. I don't have any first hand knowledge. Don't get me wrong, I do think it is cool that you modified your 320i. I'm still sticking with my position that I'd take an X1 for basically the same money with the 240 hp (from the factory) version of the N20."
2817,"March 20, 2015  1:11PM",qbrozen,"  I'm a bit confused. You agree but disagree?? Unless you meant to say it does NOT void the warranty, in which case I'd like to know how you determined that. I mean, technically it does not automatically void the warranty .... but if you have any engine issues, they can deny claims based on the modification. And the folks who claim the tune can be turned off an undetectable are misinformed. Been there, done that. Luckily I had a service advisor who was willing to keep that bit of info off his report to the manufacturer when my 135i needed work."
2818,"March 20, 2015  2:03PM",flightnurse," Having spoke to my SA about this and the coding the SA informed me that BMW is aware of BMS, and the 3+ lbs of boost, it is within the limits that BMW has built into the car, Dinan now offers something for the N26/20 engine which add's 4+ lbs of boost, so I guess that is within the limits of the engine too. When it comes to undetectable codes I can only go by what I have read by many on bimmerfest,"
2819,"March 20, 2015  2:07PM",flightnurse," I'm glad you like the X1, which you could have gotten for about the same price as your current care, but the X1 is just WAY too small for me, being 6 ft there is no back seat room."

2821,"March 17, 2015  3:54PM",Mr_Shiftright,You don't think 5.2 sec is fast? A 2015 Camaro with over 400 hp is sitting at about 5 secs. 
2822,"March 17, 2015  7:44PM",henryn," Most people would consider 0-60 in 5.2 seconds to definitely be a ""ball of fire"". Complete with flames."
2823,"March 17, 2015 10:36PM",roadburner,   5.2 seconds is definitely mid-pack these days. A dead stock 1st. Generation MS3 can do it in 5.4 seconds. Any of the V8 ponycars with at least 400 hp can do 0-60 in 4.5 seconds or less. To be considered very fast these days I'd think that a car has to go 0-60 in under 4 seconds- and 0-100 in under 11 seconds. The goalposts have moved quite a bit.
2824,"March 17, 2015 10:38PM",roadburner," To each his own, my tweaked MS3 is only a tick faster; I can't say it's slow, but it's not a rocketship by current standards."

2826,"March 18, 2015 12:33AM",roadburner," Same here; it really feels different from the newer cars. Contrast that with the X6 I drove at the press intro a few months ago- it was pretty quick but dull as dishwater to drive; a totally uninvolving steer, as the Brits would say."
2827,"March 18, 2015 12:34AM",robr2," You know, we've got it pretty good. In the 80's and early 90's, a 0-60 of under 10 seconds was IMPRESSIVE."
2828,"March 18, 2015  1:08AM",roadburner," I'd say that was true in the '70s, but not in the '80s or '90s. My 1988 M6 could do 0-60 in the high 5 second range with a Dinan or Conforti chip. The 325i and 535i were 7 second cars, easy. The Mustang GT and Z28 were also 6 second cars by the late '80s."
2829,"March 18, 2015  1:53AM",nyccarguy,"  Agree with your assessment. I've driven a friend's F10 ///M5. The car was insanely fast, yet utterly uninspiring. I've told him a few times that the ///M5 wasn't ""the car"" to buy at the $130K price point. He couldn't swing (or should I say, his wife's trust fund woudn't allow) the $150K plus for a Panamera Turbo and wouldn't drive a ""regular"" Panamera 4S because it wasn't the fastest ""top of the line"" model."
2830,"March 18, 2015  1:56AM",Mr_Shiftright,"I kinda doubt one would even feel the difference between a 4.5 car and a 5.0 car. To me, radical speed is something like the Ariel Atom, which is under 3 seconds and probably feels completely different from a 4.5 car."
2831,"March 18, 2015  2:07AM",sweendogy,Would say this 0-6O just a measure - real world passing is where its at on the highway - being able to just blast the gas at 45 and loook down and see 65/70 in a blink is where its at. Did it today just to get around slower traffic: gonzo - pretty good 2/3/5/7 seconds (dk.) 
2832,"March 18, 2015  2:19AM",dino001,"European magazines have additional additional tests, not known here, such as equivalent of going from 40 to 60 mph, or 50 to 75 mph on on highest, or second highest gear to assess flexibility of the engine, as well as its performance. This was especially important for manual transmission cars, to get you feel how much you need to operate that stick."
2833,"March 18, 2015  2:34AM",nyccarguy," Like in my Prelude. Loafing along at 70 in 5th & need to pass? Drop down to 3rd & up shift back up to 4th at 80;)  The Legacy gets the job done. It's far from the fastest car on the road, but it doesn't complain when I floor it at 70 to pass a slow roller and it has to hit 90 to get by:)"
2834,"March 18, 2015  3:02AM",roadburner," That is a good point, since flexibility-as you note-is also an important performance parameter. It's one place my MS3 really does shine; stock it did 50 to 70 mph in sixth gear in 6.7 seconds, and the minor tweaks to my car have dropped that time to 5.9 seconds- a fairly low number that not many cars can match.  Contrast that with my Club Sport; which needs to be kept above 4,000 rpm to make reasonably rapid progress. The Bimmer actually made me a better driver as there's not enough horsepower to cover up mistakes such as over-braking or blowing a corner. Horsepower can cover up a multitude of sins; it's harder for a student to ""get it"" when his first HPDE car has a lot of power and grip. I once had a B student who-driving a mildly modified E46 325i shod with R-comps-lapped an E46 M3, E92 M3, EVO VIII, and 993 in her run group. More than once. Talk about a humbling experience."
2835,"March 18, 2015  4:31AM",henryn,"Back in the day, no one ever talked about 0-60 times. It was always quarter mile times. I had a 69 Charger 440, which could get in the 13's with street tires, and in the 12's with slicks. That was pretty d___ quick for a daily driver in those days.  I remember when Car and Driver did a road test of the AC Cobra 427 (1966?). They did 0 to 100 back to 0 in 10 seconds. (I think I'm remembering that correctly.) I thought that was the epitome of performance."
2836,"March 18, 2015  7:17AM",andres3,"I think if GM wants to be treated seriously by most buyers they are going to have to make cars that don't go into limp mode at a weekend HPDE (track event) when they are extremely low miles and unmodified such as the V6 Camaro I rented. The weather was mildly warm, never got above 85 degrees the whole weekend.  Granted, you might say the V6 Camaro with an automatic transmission isn't GM's front running ""track car,"" but neither is the '06 A3 for Audi, and it NEVER went into limp mode at low miles or being left unmodified. Even modified and higher miles it usually only happened at temps above 90 degrees.  Now why would GM make cars that so easily are put into ""limp"" mode? The answer lies in previous model year rental Camaros likely BLOWING brand new transmissions and spewing fluid on the track. Solution to most car companies would be to build a better more reliable durable car with a better transmission. Solution for GM (post BK by the way) was to apparently create and/or lower threshold of going into limp mode. FAIL."
2837,"March 18, 2015  8:56AM",robr2,"  As I said, under 10 was impressive. I'm thinking more pedestrian vehicles."
2838,"March 18, 2015  2:29PM",roadburner," As I said, the goalposts have moved, 13 second quarters can now be achieved in many cases with a mildly modified hot hatch."
2839,"March 18, 2015  2:38PM",graphicguy," I concur....I think the prevalence of all these blown motors excel once you get them rolling. Even from a dead stop, they have come to the point where there is no turbo lag because of twin turbos and twin scroll turbos. S/Cs are even better.  All of these high technology motors with DI, OHC/DOHC, turbo/SC, etc have come ot the point where they're all pretty impressive given the power AND efficeincy they offer.  I know the 2.0T in my current CTS can hold court with the ;05 Mustang GT I had some years ago. By my seat of the pants, they certainly felt similar in the thrust dept. Handling, comfort, fuel efficiency, features, build quality and materials....no contest. Caddy wins....as it should. In real world $$$$$ it was $15K more than the Mustang (maybe a little less than that, given the differences in today's dollars vs dollars 10 years ago.  On the other end of that spectrum, the old adage ""there's no repacement for displacement"" still rings true....especially in the torque dept.  I wouldn't mind some seat time in a new Mustang GT or a Challenger Scat Pack!"
2840,"March 18, 2015  3:04PM",nyccarguy, Why on Gd's Green Earth would you rent a V6 Camaro with an Automatic Transmission and take it to the track? The auto enthusiasts that track their cars are so few and far between that they barely register on manufacturers' radar. You want a Camaro suited for the track? You local Chevrolet dealer will gladly sell you a Z/28 Camaro.
2841,"March 18, 2015  3:15PM",Mr_Shiftright,"Well torque relates to cylinder displacement, not the number of cylinders, so you could in fact have a very torquey 4 cylinder motor, but building one over 3.0L is not advisable. "
2842,"March 18, 2015  4:14PM",graphicguy,"          It does indeed.  But, when a motor with displacement of only 2.0L and offers nearly 300 ft/lb of torque, have to admit, that's impressive. Actually, the torque figures are better than those found in the 3.6L V6 motor they also use."
2843,"March 18, 2015  4:17PM",qbrozen,"  I disagree. My 3.6L TT CTS has quite a bit more torque than the 5.0L Mustang does, and over a wider RPM band, too. While that Coyote V8 sounds great, runs smooth, revs nicely, etc, I always felt it was a bit weak in the low RPM range.  Check out Edmunds dyno of the CTS Vsport"
2844,"March 18, 2015  5:46PM",flightnurse," I think people like to stir the pot... We have car's that are faster, safer, and get better MPG then we had 10,20,30 years ago, but to call a car that can do 0-60 in 5 sec's, the 1/4 in high 14's and still get 30 on the highway is incredible. As I wrote people use to drool over my 302, but show up in a 2015 Mustang GT and those same people would walk away from the 2015 and stand next to the 1970 302 and say, this is a real muscle car...

2849,"March 18, 2015  6:51PM",roadburner,"Exactly!  What, exactly, befell the new 535i? Steering feel. Rather, lack of steering feel. The new electric power assist has not only rendered the steering uncommunicative—particularly on-center—but, for some reason, it has also become heavier.

At the time, it was selling for high $40s equipeed the way she wanted. I think the Q is selling about $5K less today.

It's a nice idea to have a good naming convention but not IMHO if you tarnish the goodwill and brand recognition of an existing car (G35/37). They could upgrade the current car, restyle as a newer G, and rename to the G39 or something like that. Those original taillights were very distinctive and I could see them replicating something that is similar enough to suggest the old car. And then also address whatever it is about the new car that causes CU and reviewers to not like the new one not so much.  Also, small SUV - they have those but don't seem to sell many.

Cross-shopping data show that customers of the aspiring brands are more likely to defect to one of the big three or Audi than the other way around.  Not since 1998 has any brand other than BMW, Mercedes and Lexus topped the U.S. luxury market in sales. That year, Lincoln led the field. Before 1998, Cadillac held an unbroken grip on the top spot going back to before 1970.  Since Mercedes grabbed the top prize in 1999, imports have dominated the playing field. Lexus ruled 11 straight years from 2000-10. These days, the top three remain locked in a bitter struggle for the luxury title. BMW has taken the crown three of the last four years but is third so far this year, trailing Mercedes and Lexus.  Ambitious Lexus is breathing down the neck of Mercedes-Benz in a bid to regain the top spot it hasn't held since 2010. Through February, Lexus sales have jumped 26 percent, passing BMW to move into second place behind Mercedes. Like its rivals, Lexus is basing its growth on an aggressive product offensive....  Acura finished sixth in the U.S. behind Cadillac in 2014 but has jumped past Audi and Cadillac into fourth place for the first two months of 2015, demonstrating just how hot the competition is among the aspiring brands...."""

The steering and brake feel is spot on and the size is just about right- although it is a extremely porky at over 3800 lbs. 0-60 in 6 seconds is nothing to write home about, but adequate for its intended purpose.

All they tend to bring in are black, white and silver cars with black interiors. Very rarely will they bring in a vehicle without a black interior regardless of exterior color. It is bizarre."
2881,"March  9, 2015 11:33PM",markcincinnati,"White is the new black. According to our BMW store white is the most popular color. Black and silver are also popular.  White and gloss black are often the only two ""free"" paint colors offered by European mfgrs. My wife pulled the trigger on a $1,075 paint color called Panther Black -- yes it is purty, but that just seems like way too much for what appears BLACK from a distance of over 10 feet.  I used to special order Pearl White on all my Audis. Then, one year, the price jumped from $500 to $2,500 and Pearl White became a member of the Special Order collection that Audi offers to anyone who will pony up the money. It is called Audi exclusive -- hell yes it is exclusive, because anything you order -- ANYTHING -- starts at $2,500 -- why? Because they can.  In 2009, I wanted the Ecru (Cardamom) interior color and it only came with blonde wood -- I thought the contrast wasn't there, I wanted the burl walnut wood inlays. At that time, $2,000. Despite the fact that I had custom ordered the A4 Pretige with most every option listed, I just couldn't bring myself to pay $2K for something that was no charge had I not wanted the Cardamom leather. Next year blonde was dropped in favor of the dark walnut.  Much as I favor an almost the sky's the limit, I just can't see something like I have just described as anything other than an option from our ""shameless profit collection.""  BMW seems to charge breathtaking prices for wheels that aren't part of the two or three ""normal"" choices offered -- I know there are certainly differences that justify higher costs, but there was an X6 on the showroom floor with a $5,000 wheel package (tires were another upcharge).  I know a lot of options are outrageously priced, but at least it would seem they kind of bury the charge so that the price gouging isn't obvious.  Now I'll show my ignorance -- the last time I priced an Infiniti, their color palate was ""included"" in the MSRP base. This included both pearl and just clearcoat colors.  I'm the guy who would probably pay MORE for the basic car if all the paint choices were ""included"" -- it just galls me to see $1,075 for an admittedly pretty black color. It is good that I actually prefer white, cause were they to start charging extra for gloss white, I'm sure I'd scream ""I'm mad as hell and I'm not gonna take it anymore!""  Sheesh!"
2882,"March  9, 2015 11:46PM",ab348, Cadillac doesn't even offer a no-charge basic gloss white. The only white is a tricoat that is extra-cost. They do offer a no-charge basic gloss black. But some metallic paints are also no-charge. Go figure.

Both were standard on my MS3 in Grand Touring trim back in 2007. Somehow Chevrolet, Dodge, and Ford manage to make the LSD standard on their properly equipped(three pedal) V8 ponycars that they are able to crank out for $35k or under. Don't tell me Munich couldn't fit a suitable LSD at the factory for $1000- the 25% unit on my Club Sport was priced at only $500($767 in today's currency).

2891,"March 10, 2015 11:53AM",graphicguy,"I don't have many complaints about BMW, but option cost tops the list. Said it before, will again.

Not sure if they're still offering leases that are heavily subsidized or not. But, GM learned that lesson long ago. You can't subsidize forever.  Don't get me wrong. I like BMWs. But, when a 335ix tipped the $60K+ scale equipped the way I like, and the 235i came in close behind, I could see that the threshold had been exceeded.

2893,"March 10, 2015  2:28PM",billyperks4,"""There are a lot of really good cars (as good or better than BMWs) at price points that are much less""  Which???"
2894,"March 10, 2015 11:18PM",markcincinnati," The problem I have with the statement would entirely go away if the words between the parenthesis had not been part of the declaration.  Furthermore, my issue with most of these cars -- but the Germans top the list of offenders -- rears its head because I typically select the top option package and then add individual options on top of that.  A base (good luck finding one) Audi S4 is hard to beat -- but I wouldn't have one unless it had, navigation, B&O sound system, blind spot monitoring . . . and the list goes on. There is no way the technology we (or I) love, voice-activated navigation + bluetooth, etc, is worth $3,500. Hell, I can buy a 75"" Samsung HDTV for about $500 less than that, and that price is dropping 2% per month.  So, yeah, there are very good cars at attractive price points -- we can argue if this or that is BETTER than a BMW or an Audi or a Mercedes, etc, but there are a lot of comparable cars IF POPULARLY equipped. My car has almost $10,000 worth of options on it, and I didn't even get a Prestige model.  The base fill in the blank German fill in the blank is likely to drive, perform and ride better than the ""other guy"" -- but the heck of it is, the German car will be a strippie and the other guy will come chock full of features that just seem out of touch with even a generous gross margin.  Now, having said that, I will prove myself a walking and driving contradiction. I do, to this very day, believe that the Acura TLX SH-AWD with the Advance package (and ONLY that configuration) is Acura's S4. And, it is really damn near impossible to find one that rings up a $50,000 tab. Yet, if you drive the two cars, back to back, well there is that certain something (that my wife calls soul) that the Acura doesn't even seem to attempt to imitate. But the TLX's numbers are, for the bucks, impressive.  So, I complain about the price of the S4 vs the TLX (which makes a good case for itself as being in the same league), but I still put down the extra $6K-$12K for the Audi BECAUSE I test drove it.  We have met the enemy . . you know the rest."
2895,"March 11, 2015  1:06AM",flightnurse, How many of them are RWD and come with a manual transmission?
2896,"March 11, 2015  1:31AM",markcincinnati," At the risk of getting myself in hot water: NONE, since we now have numerous examples regarding performance -- stating that overall, the automatic transmission especially one with dual clutches is generally speaking (for those of us mere mortal consumers) superior AND preferred by a huge number of regular consumers. Only if enough folks spend the money and actually buy a manual transmission car, will they even be available too much longer. Automatic transmissions today improve the performance (or at least the perception of performance) of many, if not most, of the cars they are marketed with.  And, in terms of the utilization and circumstances of use by the majority of consumers (again for mere mortals), AWD no longer needs to have any apologies made for it or by it, other than to say, ""excuse me"" as the AWD version passes the RWD or FWD version. Ask Porsche, to name one, what cars they market are AWD -- the low performance or high performance variants?  I can appreciate RWD and manual transmissions -- but they're not, for the buyers that keep these ELLPS car mfgs alive and well, where the ""performance"" buyers gravitate towards.  The reasons are well documented and even if I did think RWD and manual transmissions were any more than an entry in the bibliography of a glitzy brochure (if brochures actually had bibliographies), the shoppers, buyers and actual consumers believe and behave differently (based on their spending, at least); that is auto trans cars rule and AWD is in very widespread use, often in the cars touted as THE highest performance versions.  The sooner we start recognizing that these companies that build the machines we covet probably don't care one way or another what wheels are driven and how the thing is shifted, the better, because they care overwhelmingly what will facilitate the goals of corporate survival, growth and prosperity. I would assume if BMW thought it could overwhelm Audi by building and selling FWD cars exclusively with manual transmissions, I would assume they would do so.  A dead purist is still dead, after all. Companies are no different -- the auto transmission has or is close to defeating stick shifts; turbo or super or both engines of 4 or 6 cylinders are replacing displacement based engines as each day passes and AWD cars or at least the option to add AWD is well on its way toward total market dominance.  I like being alive -- but, in my case at least, I actually think auto trans AWD vehicles are the best most of us mere mortals can get today. So I think I am a purist, just one who thinks RWD (or FWD) and stick shifts are so 1980."
2897,"March 11, 2015  1:44AM",nyccarguy,"@markcincinnati‌  It is funny. You and I are on opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to options. I think cars are really expensive to begin with. So I choose my options carefully. If I'm going for a BMW, then its going to have the lighting package, backup camera, heated seats, AWD, & a slush box. That's it. My former E90 328xi was loaded up with options that didn't really add that much to the driving experience. Sure the leather seats were really nice & the sunroof let light into its black interior. The Navigation got me 95% of the way to my destination.  Now I definitely like the way sport package equipped cars drive and look. Nowadays they are really expensive option packages that come with low profile, run flat tires that can get expensive, especially around here."
2898,"March 11, 2015  3:53AM",flightnurse,"  Mark, BMW builds the 3 series with a manual, IF people do not want all the bells and dodad's, you can order yourself a 328i w/ sport package, and manual, and be able to get about $36K if one does a European Delivery. Ora 320i w/ Sport Package and Manual, can be had for about 32K. Each are RWD and Manual."

2900,"March 11, 2015 12:55PM",graphicguy,"WE have been down this road before regarding manual transmissions. Yeah, they are fun. But, today's automatics are SO GOOD, I don't know of anyone who can actually putperform one with a manual. Tough to find any manual transmission cars, anywhere, regardless of price. Yes, you can special order them. But, dealers know if they stock them, it's a long road ahead trying to find a customer who knows how to drive one, let alone, finding someone who wants one. They're out there. They're a acarcity, though.  Even something like a Mustang GT or Camaro SS are tough to find in a manual trans. They're a bit more plentiful, but you have to search some to locale them.  I think most of the trade rags give the nod to the Cadillac ATS when it comes to 3 Series, A4 etc comparisons. I've driven an ATS, several times. They are a very fun car to drive that can rock and roll with anything in its price range. Good looking and built well with great materials, too.  I agree with Mark....on the upper end of the ELLPS range, probably the S4 could arguably be preferred over the others. Audi, at least in my exeperience (and some others here at Edmunds) aren't exactly the poster children for reliability, nor are they reasonably budget friendly to keep and operate. Still, can't argue its performance.  Acura TL SH AWD Advance? Boy....I would have a hard time justifying $50K-$60K for a 3xx ix or A/S4, C300/400 4 Matic if I were looking for a level of performance, comfort, build quality, cheap to own and operate for what I paid for mine ($38K and change). I don't have enough seat time in the TLX SH AWD to really render a judgement. But, for $45K list for the advance package, the same applies to it.  If it weren't just a wee bit tight for my tastes, I would have had a Lexus is350 F sport gracing the GG estate right now. It's a lot like the Acura TL. It doesn't lead in one category, but is really good in ALL categories. At the time, I could have plucked one up, fairly loaded for $46-$47K, too. It's design could be polarizing, too. But again, being the ""odd ball"" I am, likeing the TL's previous design, I liked the Lexus' design, too.  I understand people being polarized by the styling. But, no one can deny their trouble free nature, longevity, sport sedan handling and frugality when it comes to operation and maintenance. They are a LOT of car for that kind of money.  So, are their better cars out there than the 3 Series? From my perspective, yes....lots of them. My reasons may be different than yours, though. You start loading one up to knock on the $60K+ door, and that list grows dramatically."
2901,"March 11, 2015  3:23PM",markcincinnati,"  Thanks, but I did know that it is possible to get the BMW you mention (as well as several Audis, etc.) with a manual. The point that I was making is they represent what 1%, 2%, or maybe 3% of sales? They are becoming a ""why bother"" to manufacture feature. WE'VE killed manual transmissions. We're about to kill driving altogether. See my next post."
2902,"March 11, 2015  3:24PM",markcincinnati,"In·ev·i·ta·ble: unable to be avoided, evaded, or escaped; certain; sure to happen.  Our sometimes heated discussions about the merits of manual transmissions vs. automatics or about RWD, FWD, AWD, etc. are – or will pretty soon be – irrelevant. These discussions may be entertaining, they may even be cathartic, but there is plenty of evidence of the inevitability of semi-autonomous and ultimately autonomous cars.  With google, Apple and many others you’ve never even heard of working on technologies whose purpose it is to remove you from the driving equation, it is a matter of years – perhaps so few we could discuss the time frame in months (you know like a 60 month car-loan term) – before we essentially have “individual” mass transportation. By that I mean we’ll have individual containers (cars) that, as far as you’re concerned, provide you with about the same experience you have as when riding a bus, limo or train. You’ll have the flexibility that a private car offers and you’ll be, for the most part, nothing more than a passenger.  It probably doesn’t even matter if you want this technology or not, it’s coming. It’s coming pretty quickly too. Insurance and many other private companies, federal, state and local governments want it. You’ve (or perhaps, better said, “we’ve”) proven we’re not capable, or perhaps it is just that we’re not willing to prevent the inevitable. Just this morning, coming into work, I passed a driver of a late model Mercedes S class – the driver was on the phone! There is no way this Mercedes doesn’t come standard with hands-free, eyes-free, voice activated Bluetooth connectivity and control; yet, there was this bozo with one hand on the road, in rush-hour traffic, with the phone held up to his ear. Now, how does that make me make the leap to autonomous cars?  Well, as I am willing to say, I am often wrong, but never uncertain, we might simply mandate built in jammers that prevent cell phone usage in a moving car. But, think about it, what we really want is for the driver to not use a hand-held phone while driving. We probably don’t want to prohibit passengers from using a cell phone. Even my Audi offers in-car Wi-Fi, so it seems that we’re moving in the direction of greater, not restricted, connectivity. So what do “we” do? Rather than taking away the ability for the driver to use a hand-held phone, we’ll just go ahead and take away the ability to drive the car altogether because we have demonstrated that distracted driving is sometimes actually worse than drunk driving – and if you bother to look, you’ll find there are a lot of drivers using hand-held phones. This is all the more frustrating (for me at least) since I know that an ever increasing number of cars have Bluetooth as standard equipment.  Inevitable? Yes. While growing up, my parent’s cars never had seatbelts – in 1963 my dad bought a brand new Chrysler Newport. It did not come with seatbelts. The dealer, however, did put them in the car (2 in the front seat only). I never knew if this was in response to a government mandate or if it was part of a promotion. As time passed we graduated to cars that came with 3 seatbelts in the front (unless you had bucket seats), then rear seatbelts, then shoulder belts then seatbelt interlocks that essentially attempted to force seatbelt use as the cars would not start unless the seatbelts were fastened (leading to folks fastening their seatbelts, then sitting on them, therefore defeating the purpose.)  We can, in the name of safety, list all of the inevitable features that have been added since 1963 – actually, we could have another list of all of the features added in the name of safety before 1963. These two lists, with descriptions, would fill volumes.  These days, any manufacturer who wants to, can crank out a 300HP motor and put it in a lightweight body. And they can do so for what is (for someone my age) an almost unbelievably low price. Even 350HP, 400HP or 500HP are pretty much within the engineering talents of just about any name brand auto manufacturer. Likewise, 6,7,8,9 and 10 speed automatics, some with dual clutches and torque converters (in the same transmission) further multiply many car’s accelerative capabilities sometimes stretching the limits of the short-attention span humans we’ve seen increasing on the planet at an alarming rate. When 0-60MPH can happen in less than 6 seconds and when, at 60MPH, you’re overtaking anything not moving at a rate of 88 feet per second, it’s no wonder untrained and distracted drivers crash and burn.  The response? Intervention. Police intervention? Sure, but often that is after it is too late. What is, apparently, better is for the car to intervene on the driver’s behalf. First came four-wheel brakes, eventually disc brakes, then anti-locking brakes, then electronic stability programs, then radar/sonar pre-sense systems, cameras and more cameras, lane warning systems, lane keeping systems, systems meant to keep you awake, systems that can bring a car to a full-stop and maintain assured clear distances at highway speeds approaching triple digits. Then there are the slow speed crash avoidance systems, pedestrian safe-keeping systems, night vision systems, automatic mirrors and automatically deployed headlight beams that dim whenever approaching traffic is detected. Infiniti, despite much negative press, even disconnected the steering wheel from the steered wheels altogether as they designed – perhaps intentionally, who knows – a semi-autonomous car, the Q50. Google has demonstrated their autonomous driving handiwork, too, in a Mercedes S-class; and recently an Audi A7 (or so it appeared to be) navigated, at speed, the Nürburgring. Look ma, no hands!  Recently, I have, with humorous intent, invoked the quote from Pogo, “We’ve met the enemy and he is us.” Now, without mirth, I re-invoke the saying and once again, I blame you (all of us, really) for not learning how to drive, not learning safety and performance driving. I blame us, as a culture, as a species, for not making the requirements for getting an automobile driving license perhaps nearly as rigorous as the requirements to get a private airplane pilot’s license.  If we all had to know how to drive defensively – and prove it – we could, perhaps, forestall the inevitable autonomous automobiles currently picking up speed in the pipeline to a retailer near you. Yes, forestall, not prevent, because eventually, even great education won’t be enough, great engineering will prove inadequate and “traffic law” enforcement will always remain mostly an after-the-fact activity rather than robust preventative measures.  I – alone at my house, anyway – pretty much welcome autonomous cars, because driving on our I-275 with the apparently ignorant [great] majority of the population (and I include myself) is just too much Sturm und Drang (Storm and Stress). I have this wonderful 333HP sporty sedan and I drive it mostly in stop and go traffic, bumper-to-bumper (no matter how hard I try to maintain one car length for every 10MPH) and at about 47MPH (or less, truth be told). The hell of it is, I live in Cincinnati – have you ever been here? This place is barely a city for pity’s sake; it is so small, so relatively sparsely populated. I can only imagine the frustration of having an S4 in Chicago or Boston or Dallas. Hell yes, gimmie a car that I can program to my destination, push or say “engage,” meanwhile I work on my iPad mini catching up on my [State Department] emails and other mi·nu·ti·ae: The small, precise, or trivial details of something.  At least if I’m in my car, not having fun driving it, I can be in my car not having fun but at least being somewhat productive.  “Oh, what a world! What a world!

2904,"March 11, 2015  5:39PM",markcincinnati,"My wife calls the differences between her last car, an Infiniti and my last car, an Acura, a lack of soul. I understand that she probably means something that is there but very difficult to quantify -- it can't be measured and written down, that is.  I did, mostly, enjoy my 2012 TL (most especially the audio system -- I still have the DVD-Audio discs), were I to even attempt to characterize what I could articulate differentiated the TL vs the S4, it would start with a sense that the Acura seemed ""flimsy,"" most notable when closing the doors. The Audi closes with a muted, solid whomph! sound, no clicking or other mechanical noises, the door closing almost seems hydraulic it is so smooth so ""of a billet of solid steel"" invoking. The Acura on the other hand, sounded a bit like an empty tin can being dropped from about 5 feet onto asphalt. The very comfortable, heated and ventilated seats, in the Acura also had a bit of ""play"" or give in them somewhat like a table at a bar that needs a folded pack of matches put under one of the legs to keep it from wobbling. I don't know if I would call the Acura's feel something as negative as ""OK fit and finish,"" perhaps I would simply call it ""less solid"" feeling than the Audis (or BMWs) we've had.  If that equates to soul (my wife's term, remember), well there you have it. Please remember I am not saying I think the Acura is not a good car, a very high value car, a fully-featured car with lots of impressive technology. I also thought the SH-AWD with the 19"" wheel tire package made the TL elicit a sense of deja vu -- like it was, somehow, related or at least relate-able to an S4.  I, at age 63, now think life's too short (for me, at least) to drive an Acura TL or TLX when there are cars like the S4 on the market.  But, if you read my previous post, in probably doesn't matter since most cars will be nearly autonomous before the note on your new car is paid off."

2908,"March 11, 2015  7:02PM",flightnurse," Mark, Audi does not built a RWD drive car that has a 50/50 weight distribution, neither does MB, Infiniti or Lexus. I agree that the automatics of today are just as good if not better. The 8 spd in my 320i with the coded Sport Transmission is a great unit, I can cruise in comfort and not feel it shift, or if I want to be sporty and hold the rev's longer, I push the toggle switch to Sport, and if I want to push it harder, I'll push the toggle switch again and the transmission goes into Sport+. Then the transmission shifts quicker, and will hold to redline until I move the shift down for a higher gear (320i's do not have paddle shifters from the factor, but can be added via the aftermarket for about $500.)  When people talk about the car in the past being better, this reminds me of when my EX and I had a couple of classic cars, he had a 57 Continental Mark II (Please do not call it a Lincoln Continental) and I had a 70 Olds 442 Convertible W30 and a 70 Mustang 302. The Olds was the classic A body car. Yes, it was fast but not really THAT fast, the Mustang was quick, faster then the Olds, but not as fast or quick or quick as cars in the late 90's, and lets talk comfort, the Olds was an Auto, the Mustang was a stick, the clutch on the stang was SOOOO stiff it was rough to drive it around town or smooth. The Continental rode like it was on clouds, smooth and elegant, but trying to stop 2.5 tons of car with drum brakes, was a feat... Even the Olds and stang had disk brakes up front they still didn't stop all that well. So when I hear people talk about the good ole days of cars and how good they are, I just laugh.. Give me a 335i with sport package, a car that is faster, smooth, handles better and is suited for the long haul over the older muscle cars. Even the 2015 Stang GT is faster, and is a lot more comfortable to drive and handles so much better..

But, it still doesn't matter -- ""no one"" buys them. I did test drive both an S4 6-speed manual and the DSG I ended up getting -- the DSG (shhh don't let this out) was better at it than I and, at high RPM's, the DSG never made a misstep and didn't require me to drive with one hand on the wheel.  I drank the Kool-aid apparently.  And, although I could have gotten my S4 with a stick, the S3, perhaps foreshadowing other coming attractions, can only be had with a 6-speed DSG.  Even my wife's 8-speed tiptronic has been programmed by folks so skilled, it seems like it MUST be a DSG, too.  I don't know about durability, but I imagine I might find out this time, since I plan to keep the thing beyond the factory warranty (but I have been thinking I would buy an extended warranty, cover myself with butter and carry lemons just in case.)  Yet, another argument that ""they're"" hoping ""we'll"" make is that we'll want to keep our vehicles as up to date as possible; and since most cars can't be updated to adopt the latest and greatest technologies, the notion of replacing cars about every 3-4 years does have some merit."

2918,"March  6, 2015  8:27AM",tlong," Actually have not driven either yet. If I were to buy Acura again I would get the ILX as I've had the TL for 10 years and am tired of a car of this size - I want it a bit smaller. So no TLX, plus I'm not in the mood to spend that much. I certainly could afford it but just want to maximize my enjoyment and luxury for the $$. - I looked at the specs - I would pay probably $5K more for a ILX than a fully loaded Mazda 3 sedan. The Mazda has things like HUD, blind spot warning, even radar cruise control, all around $30K tops. It is a small bit larger than the ILX. It is widely praised as being like a baby BMW in handling. I know that in our '07 Mazda 5 which is of course a microvan, in pure maneuverability it outshines my current TL by quite a bit - tighter turning circle, better steering feel as an example. I would expect the current Mazda 3 to do quite a bit better than that.  The ILX on paper is a little smaller. Given my TL experienc, I'm sure it would be reliable and might be more refined than the Mazda, which is a consideration. The ILX has more HP but less torque, so not sure how they will both feel. And am still considering getting a manual if I could find either of them in that tranny, since they are both still offered with manual transmissions.  The other alternative is just hanging onto my '05 TL a few more years. It stays reliable at 150K, still looks good and drives well, I put a few $$ into it occasionally for battery/tires/brakes/fluids/etc. I did get the engine mounts and some suspension bushings changed at about 137K and spent about a grand.

2919,"March  6, 2015  9:15AM",benjaminh,"  I didn't know you could option up a Mazda3 all the way to 30k. But I went to their site and you're right--it can be done. Since the Acura ILX starts at 28k msrp, depending on the options you want you could have an ILX for less than a fully tricked out 3. In terms of size, the two are very close. In fact, the ILX and the 3 are within about an inch of each other in length and width.  The Mazda 3 with the 2.5 is rated by the epa at 32 mpg combined, which is a big jump from the 21 of your 2005 TL. But the ILX does pretty well at 29.  In terms of acceleration, at least according to Car and Driver, the ILX is about a second faster going to 60 than the Mazda3 2.5. ILX: 6.3 ; Mazda3 2.5: 7.3. To me it seems like a possible case for the ILX, but since I haven't driven either one I don't know about driving enjoyment.  The 2016 ILX is no longer available with a manual. The standard transmission is an 8 speed DC with an exclusive torque converter. It does come with paddle shifters..."

And, in 1976, your final act before getting your Master's was what was then called Master's Orals. As far as I know these days if you take and pass the courses you get the degree.

2928,"March  8, 2015  4:42PM",markcincinnati," When I was new to trips to Germany, I would take every opportunity my wife would permit to go into Audi dealerships. I did the same thing on one trip to Zurich. I kept noticing no inventory -- but sometimes quite a showroom.  One trip, I went to the new Audi dealership that is at the Munich airport -- I asked the rep why no inventory? He told me that almost all of the cars they sell are ordered. Almost every Audi (and BMW) that we've had since 1978 have been special order cars. I always thought if you're going to spend ($50K+ in today's $s) and will settle for your third color option and not getting the options you wanted, etc, there must be something wrong with your sense of money. Why pay that much for a car that you wouldn't ever special order, but you'll take it because you can pick it up on Monday?  The 10th (so they say) largest BMW dealer is here in Cincinnait. We have two Audi dealerships, two BMW, three Mercedes, two Porsche, etc etc, stores in our Big Town (almost a small city). I have, many times, attempted to find THE car I wanted in stock -- ""can't be done!"" My most recent Audi was $57+K and my wife's SQ5 was $65+K. At what level of income does one have to achieve in order to settle for a $60K car that is ""sitting on the lot?""  I wanted blind spot monitoring and red leather. I also wanted all-season OEM tires. My wife also wanted blind spot and red leather -- but she wanted metallic black, while I wanted white. I would've probably taken the metallic white Audi offers, but I was very specific in what I wanted as was she.  What I can't imagine is being willing to settle on in-stock inventory, unless the exact vehicle was available or unless the price was hugely discounted. I took my 2012 Acura TL with a black leather interior -- a color I said I would never have (it makes the inside of the car feel small, to me at least, plus it is hotter than hell in the summer and the black seats often fade and look cheap) -- because the price was steeply discounted. What was I thinking? That fugly interior may have contributed to my relatively short time with the thing.  So, here is the other ""benefit"" of ordering your car: it kind of feels like you get ""the new car joy"" twice, once when you order it and once a couple of months later when it comes in.  Ordered cars, too, generally cost less than ones from inventory. The reason? The dealer doesn't have to pay the interest on the cars while they sit in inventory -- the dealer has a customer the moment the car comes in. Floorplan costs for your ordered car are likely to be very low.  When I see one of those mega dealerships with a 150 car showroom and a huge (acres) lot -- one so big you have to be shuttled to the location of the car you're going to look at -- I assume someone has to pay for that, and I assume it will be the customers.  The tiny dealer can order the same car as the big guy -- so if you're looking for the best deal, well the dealer that is so big the TV commercials have to be shot from a helicopter, is the one to avoid. Sometimes, Small really is Beautiful."
2929,"March  9, 2015  1:13PM",graphicguy,"Mark....like you. many times I've bemoaned the fact that the BMW dealers just seem to carry the ""middle of the road"" colors and options on their cars. My BMW dealer (Sweeney) is a little bit better than the other place as far as having stock that meets my wants closer. But still, it's a struggle to find exactly what I want.  As you noted, the two Audi stores are even worse. Mercedes dealers seem to be a bit better, but I'm not really a fan of their cars. So, outside of helping my sister buy one, and the cursory looks I give them when I'm shopping, I can't mention whether their stock situation is good or not.  I know whenever I've become frustrated with the selection when buying a BMW, my long time sales associate is more than willing to order something. I never have. But, depending on their cycle of ordering, he's said it takes between 4 to 6 weeks from ordering until I'd be picking it up.  I can see the allure for the dealership. No floor plan to pay. It's pretty much a guaranteed sale, getting exactly the car YOU want. And, price is agreed up front (or at least it should be).  I've been to one of the Porsche dealers. Like their cars, but the dealership acted like I was invisible. I passed by two sales offices where the sales person looked up to see me, and ignored me. I passed two in the showroom who wouldn't even make eye contact.  No Porsches for me."

2931,"March  9, 2015  3:31PM",dino001,"Why pay that much for a car that you wouldn't ever special order, but you'll take it because you can pick it up on Monday?  That's what I say. I think same principle applies even to much cheaper cars. Considering that they are often even bigger portion of buyer's income (i.e. price of Ford Focus is most likely higher percentage of their buyer's income than those buying new 3- or 5-series; not always, but more often than not).  I never understood American ""have to have it today"" culture. Ironically, the need for instant gratification, today considered a ""core American value"", is a far departure from thrift and patience were virtues preached by the first settlers, but that's another story. As I was saying many times before, part of my attraction of German brands to me is the real ability to get something that's in the catalogue. The salesmen never complain, never roll their eyes, or repeatedly attempt to sell you what's there here and now. I consider a single proposal acceptable, what I hate is a hard push against clearly expressed customer's wish. Many other brands have ""phantom"" configurations, options and packages that can be specified together as ""available"", but not really available - not just not in stock, but simply not possible to get, even with waiting. When ask, you get this blank stare, like you just arrived from another planet. Some dealers would pretend to take an order and then try to fit what they have in the pipeline. Two months later, you get a phone call: there is one coming, just your color and option X, but it has a sunroof that you didn't ask for, is that OK? I've seen that too many times.  My only beef with German brand dealers, is that there are some options that truly change the car's characteristics, but not available in stock. Case in point - BMW 3 and 4 series have this adaptive M-sport suspension, which may or may not be a good thing. It is the only way to get a sport suspension on their AWD models, where Sport and M-Sport lines are only decorative aesthetic options (as opposed to RWD models, where sport suspension is added). I'm still yet to see any car in stock with that option. So should I want an X-drive car (e.g. wagon or GT models comes only with that that), I'd like to know how that adaptive M-sport suspension would work, if it's worth that extra thousand bucks, or not. I can't. Well, I'll live, I guess. Most likely I'll get RWD 4-series with Sport Line, anyway."
2932,"March  9, 2015  3:39PM",dino001," I think that's the price we pay for much lower price point on those cars. As you may know, Europeans pay often more than double for the same vehicles. I checked it - literally my $46K MSRP wagon in 2013 would have been around $100K over there. At that level, volumes must be significantly lower, but the choices are much bigger. Rather than three engines, you get something like eight. Interior comes both bundled and unbundled, same thing with convenience and performance options. Our option sheet for a model is three-four pages, theirs are fifty-page books. We enjoy lower price at expense of choices, limited even further by dealers catering to our own instant culture. They can be very particular, what to buy, but they pay for that privilege. To each their own, I guess.  BTW, there are similar market differences in electronics. When I was first buying some audio equipment (long time ago), I was struck how little choice was there in a big box store, despite all that square footage in comparison with a typical European store, especially in ""above entry level, below upscale"" category."
2933,"March  9, 2015  5:00PM",flightnurse,"I was talking to our CA yesterday he was informing me that BMW has not released their ED allocation yet for the 2016 MY (something I already knew.) Chapman BMW has 2 2014 328i GT, both with M sport package, both equipped the same way. chapmanbmw.com/Phoenix-BMW-3-Series-2014-BMW-328i+xDrive+Gran+Turismo-440868.htm Our CA was telling me that we can get the car for 9K off MSRP plus the additional $1500 for in stock unit, then add the $1K rebate from BMWNA for being a BMWCCA member, Its a nice offer, but the car has black interior, the exterior is the Estoril Blue Metallic. Rick does not want Black interior living here in the SW that is the last color one wants to have.  What I find interesting is, the CA say's, the GM orders the cars based on what people buy, this makes sense, however, I told him if the GM only orders cars with black interior and people purchase what is in stock does that really mean that black interior is what they want? Most of the 3 series they have in stock has, black interior, I would beat that many who purchase 2 and 3 series do not know they can order their cars and of course the CA's are going to say anything about as they do not make money until the car is delivered.  Now on a side note, my CA informed that BMW has raised the residual on the 5 series from 60% to 64% on all 5 series excluding M5's, So this means you can get into a 5 series for less then $500/m on a 36 month lease."
2934,"March  9, 2015  5:19PM",nyccarguy, a $52K 3er without Xenon Headlights? Hmmm. How cheap are they willing to lease the car?

2937,"March  9, 2015  6:32PM",markcincinnati,"When we ordered my wife's two X3's we did order the sport seats, the sport steering wheel, etc -- we also got sport wheels with +1"" wheel size and wide and lower profile tires.  Two things struck me:  #1 if you get the package with the sport steering wheel, you can't have the wheel heated.  #2 no matter what ""sport"" option you selected, there was nothing that changed the calibration or ride height -- i.e., there was no sport suspension. The best you could do to sport the thing up was the bigger wheels and tires, which do help somewhat -- but the overall suspension is the same with or without the sport options.  Audi has a package they call ""SLine"" that is or was available -- and it did (on the A4 at least) offer sport seats, +size wheels and tires and lower ride height, stiffer springs, struts and thicker anti-roll bars (front and reat). Sometimes they even included a special steering wheel but they did include paddle shifters too when one ticked off the ""SLine"" option.  I see the A6, too, can be had with an all season or summer only sport package which does alter the suspension to ""sport"" calibration.  According to the special brochure, Audi's S cars have ""special S tuned"" suspensions which I believe our friends over on AudiWorld.com say is different from the sport package offered on the A4 and A6.  Why BMW chose NOT to offer a sport suspension on their X-drive cars is a mystery to me -- they surely must have the technical know how to engineer it, one would think.  Tires contribute to the cars handling, doh!, you already knew that. So, here is something you can do that you may find has value to you. When you order a new Audi S4 with the all-season tire option, it comes with 18"" wheels and 40 series tires. The optional tire package comes with 19"" wheels and 35 series tires.  The all-season tires are H rated grand touring Continentals or other Name Brand all-season tires. When you graduate to the 19"" wheels, the tires are Z rated (at least) and could be Continentals -- but they are MaxPerformance tires.  The difference, here in America, at least is that the Continental tires are ""good,"" but unless kept inflated to at least 42 pounds, they are built for comfort, not for performance. Why Audi chose H rated tires is beyond me.  When ordering the 19"", the tires are summer only rubber that helps the car go like a snake in a rat hole when compared with the H rated grand touring rubber.  So, what you can do, if you are an American who doesn't need or won't swap out tires twice per year, is go ahead and get the all seasons that come with the thing and upgrade (it is called +Zero) to a wider, lower profile Ultra high performance tire that will fit on the 18"" wheels -- or you can keep the same size tires but get UHP all-seasons. The difference is not subtle -- the car's willingness to turn in is cranked up to 11, it then really does go like a snake in a rat hole, and you won't be obliged to swap out your tires semi-annually.  Here's the deal, I THINK: European manufacturers, attempting to cater to American tastes, try to err on the side of comfort, quietness and durability beyond 25,000 miles. In doing so, I think they go too far. Why would Audi (for example) put H rated Grand-Touring tires on an ""S"" (not SLine) vehicle? I replaced ours with W rated UHP DWS Continentials (all season, Dry Wet, Snow), inflated the fronts to 43 and the rears to 41 -- transformation!  With virtual mass customization the norm these days, why not offer Grand Touring, All-Season Ultra High Performance and Summer only Maximun Performance tire options on the order form and be done with it?  Or at least think: BMW ""M"" is supposed to be more than an emblem or decal, more than trim and bling; likewise ""S"" (for Audi) is supposed to be a special version of a given Audi model, that includes sport: seats, exhaust, suspension, steering wheel and pedal covers, AND (one would think) TIRES. Somehow both Audi and BMW have an incomplete circuit somewhere that seems to prevent the inclusion of all of the required ingredients that go along with the notion of a ""sport model"" designation.  Let's see what Volvo and Mercedes offer . . . . hmm?"

2941,"March  4, 2015  6:31PM",roadburner,"markcincinnati- Mmy opinions pretty much align with this article, which essentially anoints the M235i as the true successor to the E46 M3- although I'm more than ""slightly annoyed that it’s not used on a broader range of the company’s products."" It's shrewd but cynical marketing on Munich's part, forcing enthusiasts to pay considerably more to get a car with traditional BMW driving characteristics. Even European drivers are unsure of which end their 1er is driven, so I suppose BMW figures why bother offering a better driving experience.  Another problem is that the competition has become much more intense as the playing field has leveled. It used to be that great handling, supportive seats, decent brakes, and an engaging powertrain were the exclusive province of the Europeans, but not any more.  For example, If I wanted an AWD performance car a BMW wouldn't be on my radar- a Golf R would be my likely choice, at least until the Focus RS arrives or Mazda offers their rumored AWD 300 hp MS3. While the M235i would be my choice if I wanted a great two door coupe, It's hard to ignore the S5, Mustang GT or 370Z NISMO which bracket the 2er at both ends of its price range. To each his own, but after 35 years of continuous BMW ownership I no longer many vehicles in their product line to be even remotely desirable..."

2945,"March  4, 2015  6:59PM",markcincinnati,"I don't know how it happened, but my wife's interest in cars these days seems to focus on horsepower and torque, all-wheel-drive, safety, handling capability (even if hardly ever tapped), some bells and whistles (but she thinks cruise control is the devil's own feature, refuses to use it) -- like blind spot monitoring, sat nav and voice commands for the phone and nav -- and, big wheels and tires (she has to have 20"" wheels and very wide, low profile Ultra High Performance All-Seasons).  Sure, she wants good gas mileage and a reliable and durable car -- all wrapped up in a vehicle that meets her definition of ""soul."" Her SQ5 (and, truth be told, probably a Porsche Macan) dots all the ""i's"" etc. Her Infiniti FX35 -- a car that I thought was very capable, even though it lacked a 354HP supercharged engine -- was very well built, was reliable for nearly 60,000 miles (so I can't speak to its durability) and despite its thrashy engine note, was pretty much fun to drive (if you could stand 16MPGs). Yet, her Infiniti and my Acura TL pretty much made her run, not walk to the Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Mercedes, Porsche, Volvo and VW dealers to find a CUV -- a high performance CUV. The 300HP X3 was good, the Volvo XC60 Type-R was good, too, the Mercedes M class, VW Toureg and Cadillac SRX all had merit. We even tried the top o' the line Jeep Grand both with and without the Hemi. The MDX and RDX were also tested and quickly rejected.  When we got to the 3,0T Audi Q5 there was a glimmer of hope -- and there we were torn between the Q5 and X3 -- until we test drove the SQ5. I've never seen $21,000 (the down payment on the $65K MSRP) exit the checking account more quickly -- I think the second test drive of the SQ5 sealed the deal.  Yet, some here have spouses (or significant others) who are all about gas mileage or roominess for kids, dogs -- and all the stuff that goes along with kids and dogs.  And, the good news is, we're all right -- the SQ5 is the best car, just as the MDX or the TLX or the 535 or the ATS or A4 quattro or even the lowly Accord -- all of these vehicles are the best for ""your"" circumstances and situations.  When we get to the ELLPS and LPS class of cars, we are well beyond the basics -- we're into vehicles that are helping us in their own ways to self-actualize. That is what it is about -- finding the car that today will help you self-actualize. I'd add, if your spending on a new car doesn't help you even in some tiny way to self-actualize, you've NOT chosen wisely.  One of the car magazines (Automobile perhaps, hell, I dunno, I subscribe to all of them for pity's sake), has a phrase they use ""No Boring Cars."" I think as we enter one of the later decades of life, we do actually start to believe ""now is the time to eschew 'boring' cars"" (and other things, but this is the place for cars, NOT for other things); we decide we can differentiate between an Impala and a CTS, we can appreciate a Panamera (even if we decide not to spend that much on a car).  I've really enjoyed reading all the posts here (well mostly), for example the ones about the upcoming trip to Germany to pick up the new BMW, the good the bad and the ugly S4 issues, the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat, so to speak.  I do enjoy the many perspectives y'all bring to the party here. I love it when this forum is active -- even when time doesn't permit my participation.  We are, if you axe me, in the golden age of cars -- almost limitless choice and hardly a klinker in the bunch.  I now have 23,000+ miles on my '14 S4 -- today I lust for an S6, tomorrow I'll instead hope for a new, slightly larger S4 to be unveiled. All the while, I am impressed every time I get behind the wheel of my current car. Reading your posts about your adventures in car shopping (and some mis-adventures) is great fun, often informative and from time to time frustrating.  Sorry to get so sentimental, but this forum is really a terrific outlet for those of us car enthusiasts whose appetite is larger than our bank accounts. It also has been, for me at least, a fantastic catharsis.  As you were."

Some of the new tech stuff is cool, what is really nice is cars today are rolling computers in which one could code a car to have these new techie stuff without paying for them. The downside is, when you take your car into the dealer they will update your firmware if an update is out. How to side step this is, to tell your service managers NOT to update the firmware."

I'm not disputing that it gets fantastic mileage or eats up hours of western US highways without a hint of driver fatigue. The car is comfortable and quiet. It is more spacious than the E90 I had.

I drive the 320 the way BMW has intended it to be driven, as a daily driver, and the car does this well.

The only thing that she thought was a worthy competitor to the SQ5 was the Macan S (we didn't drive the Turbo -- and yes I know they're both turbocharged -- since it was way more money than we had planned to spend); yet similarly equipped the Porsche was some $10K more and it didn't even have pushbutton start and the design of the Macan made is have less utility.

Still don't care for the steering. Yes, the car actually goes where I want it to go (suspension seems to be responsive and compliant enough), but lack of the feedback is pretty significant for anybody who ever owned cars like Subaru WRX, or previous 3-series, especially like mine, with sport suspension. Every time after those couple of days, or a test-drive of other 3-series derivatives in the market, including 335 or 435 (those were with MSport lines), I'm glad I can get back behind the wheel of my 328 wagon. It's not as fast, or fuel efficient, may be even a bit noisier, but the steering feedback feel is far superior. Why BMW changed it? Two reasons - fuel and market demand. The second one came from their desire to sell more and more units. The more you want to sell, the more you have to appeal to average Joe, even if Joe has more than average income. Americans like things soft, I cru through tears every time I read those comments about ""such harsh"" suspension on sport package, they clearly never drove Audi, whose ""sport suspensions"" generally consist of stones in places of springs . But the steering was reporteadly ""too rigid"" for people - so BMW changed it. In America bigger and softer is still ""better""."

2962,"March  5, 2015  2:12PM",graphicguy,"BEing a staunch Acura and BMW lover, I was as shocked as anyone when I found the CTS to be more engaging to drive than either.  My 3rd gen TL was good, but a bit darty on the road. Fun to drive, though. The 4th gen TL (Acura Shield grill) added to the previous gen in big doses. It was more sophosticated, suspension was much better, it was faster, smoother....just all around better.  The current TLX I need more seat time in. But, it seemed to regress a bit over the previous version. Yes, it had all the tech....LED lights, shift buttons, 9 speed trans, quieter, plus it hit a price point with the 4 cyl that will appeal to many. But,, I came away thinking I enjoyed my 4th gen TL drive better.  I do think RB is right. There are driving enthusiasts who do know what their car can do and the specs of just about every important function of the car.  Then, there are those who just don't care. They just want a BMW or a Mercedes. They know what they're buying before they get behind the wheel of the test drive. They wouldn't know the difference between understeer or torque steer if you held a fire to their feet.  Not saying any of that is bad. Just think the majority of sales by the likes of the German brands have little to do with how engaging their cars are to drive. It has more to do with the perception of themselves by owning one of those brands.  Benjamin....the thing with a TLX, you'll not find a car with more tech in it on the road. It handles well (4 cyl and SH AWD versions). It's relatively quick. And, once you drive it off the dealer's lot, the only things you'll be back for is oil changes and tire rotations for most of its life. And if you do need something out of warranty fixed, you won't have to take a 2nd mortgage out. They get good MPG to boot. So, there's a lot to like.  TLONG....have you driven the new TLX yet? Might be worth it if you're actually starting to look. Although, I can't knock you for looking at something like the Mazdaspeed 3, however."
2963,"March  5, 2015  2:55PM",markcincinnati,"""We have met the enemy and he is us."" -- Pogo.  I agree with the following statement made here by one of our fellow posters:  ""The more you want to sell, the more you have to appeal to average Joe, even if Joe has more than average income.""  What I sense here, however, is that ""average Joe"" is meant to imply someone who, due to their lack of sophistication, and due to their sheer numbers has been at least partially responsible for the degradation of the ""essence"" of BMW automobiles (at least the 3 series apparently) ride and handling characteristics. Somehow I get the feeling here that I (we) am (are) meant to hold ""average Joe"" accountable and to blame for the sorry state of current BMWs steering and ride/handling characteristics.  What BMW did was realize, apparently, that it is better to be popular with respect to your target market rather than attempt to appeal to what some have called the lunatic fringe. If you are the CEO, what is your charge? I would argue it is to first retain market share then to gain market share. If your loudmouth customers won't put their money where their mouths are, do whatever it takes to find the customers and prospective customers who will.  Why is it so difficult, virtually impossible, these days, to find manual transmission cars? If you read what I read, you would think manuals are the best way to go if you want the best performance possible. Were I an auto manufacturer's CEO, and I read these posts and virtually all of the automotive enthusiasts magazines, I would start making stick shifts available all across my car lines. I would spend time and treasure to make certain my brand would offer stick shifts and that my dealers would be required to keep stick models in stock.  My company would suffer, because as Pogo says, ""the enemy is us"" [sic]. All of us loudmouths who want stick shifts (based on our bellyaching) were all yak and no shak! Stick shifts aren't popular, they don't sell and if I listened to the lunatic fringe, my car company would die on the vine.  Stiff suspensions and steering that offers road feel don't increase sales, in fact they must actually decrease sales or they would dominate.  It is possible to order an Audi A6 with a sport suspension, ultra low profile tires and 20"" wheels -- and those tires would be max performance designation and be made of short tread life summer only compounds. You would think the benefits of the lower stiffer suspension calibration thicker anti-roll bars and the above mentioned tires and wheels would be so obvious that dealers couldn't keep A6's so built in stock.  The reality is, the very few sport suspension equipped models are the slowest sellers. Pogo strikes again.  I say we all need to go out and BUY the 3 series all tarted up with every performance enhancing option possible, ditto the Audi, Cadillac and Mercedes (and other brands) models.  We need to shut up, grow up and pay up -- the cars you're (me too) bitchin' about are the way they are because of YOU. If you had forced the issue and actually put your money where your mouth is, well we'd have great performing BMWs (and the others, too) instead of the cars so many of us decry as ""not what they used to be.""  The way they used to be is not responsive to the market.  Qwit yur bitchin'"
2964,"March  5, 2015  5:23PM",graphicguy,"Mark....bravo.  I have a little bit of a different view on a couple of points. Manual transmissions......frankly, I doubt there's anyone on this board that can shift faster than the current crop of autos. That's why we've been seeing performance numbers that are higher for autos than they are for automatics. Same goes for MPG (which isn't a ""nice to have""....gov't is making big MPG numbers a necuessity).  Personally, I'd rather have a 4 on the floor big block to carry me around. Efficient? Not hardly. Heavy and unwieldy? Yep...pretty much. But, that's what I'd like.  Point being, to gather market share, the BMWs, the Mecedes, the Infinitis, etc are all moving towards the middle. ""Let me have my 3-pointed star or my roundel, so I can get noticed. The rest? Performance? Handling? Who cares? That's not why I bought this car."" Those are the customers in this segment, now."
2965,"March  5, 2015  6:14PM",dino001,"I generally agree with you, Mark. I AM paying up (of course within limits of my abilities), I WILL NOT buy a car from a lot, just because it is a ""better deal"", if it doesn't hit my minimum requirements. There is no deal, if one gets not what they want. I also totally understand BMW's move. Calling me a part of ""lunatic fringe"" is a bit harsh - perhaps ""eccentric few"" would be more polite . Unfortunately, both average Joe Sixpack and Joseph Broker want a car ""today"". They can't fathom waiting for one a few weeks. So dealers and manufacturers run their business for those guys' pleasure, not mine. I already feel lucky, when I mention a special order, I get a quick nod from a salesman saying ""no problem, all we need is XYZ"", rather than more typical deer in headlights looks.  While I acknowledge BMW's right to do what they think is best for them, I also reserve myself a right to [non-permissible content removed] a little, if their choices differ from my preferences - just like with any other product we buy. There is no law saying we have to be ecstatic every time we buy something. Sometimes we buy a compromise - I venture to say most of the time. Ultimately, I know I have to adjust and get something closest to my ""ideal"" product. Doesn't mean I can't express in places like this, what I would like to see, or why I think that product is not available."
2966,"March  5, 2015  7:04PM",markcincinnati," OMG -- I am not in any way, shape, manner, form or regard suggesting (for REAL) that we shouldn't express our opinions. For pity's sake, I was ranting -- sometimes I just get worn out reading posts about how things were better then than they are now.  Sure it is possible that a product (and a car is a product) from 2000 or 1996 or even 2012 is superior in some way or many ways to a 2015 model. Overall, it is my belief that as time passes the products generally improve either by being more effective or more efficient or both.  The thing is, somebody writes (while obviously wringing their hands) how they're so very very disappointed in the (speaking of automobiles) fill-in-the-blank's appearance, engine, transmission, seats, sound system, nav system, fuel economy, wheels, tires, brakes, headlights, tail-lights, side-lights, and on and on and on until I could just scream.  If, for instance, you don't care for the Audi A4 2.0T (insert trim level and options here) because it has a 4-cylinder engine and a tinny sounding audio system and flat, non-supportive seats, well I would counter with either: Don't buy one or Option the thing up the way you want it including getting an S (and in some cases RS) model. Audi and BMW (again, to name just two) provide customers with extensive optional (or ""available"") configurations.  ""The 'old' 3-series was better?"" Better than what? I would argue you can option the 3-series to provide the looks (within reason), performance, handling, creature comforts, etc, that will allow you to have it your way.  Miss the i6 engine of yesteryear? Can't see yourself driving anything less than a vehicle with 6-cylinders? Get a 335. Better yet, get an M3 and stop being such a cry-baby. Me? I had to settle for an S4 with a 7-speed DSG transmission with a very nice B&O sound system and blind spot monitoring to say nothing of beautiful red leather seats. You'd think I'd gone daft were I to tell you my 1996 5-cylinder S6 was seriously a ""better"" car (even though it is a sentimental favorite).  Have to have a stick shift? -- well maybe you can maybe you can't get one in the particular fill-in-the-blank you want; but, as has been correctly noted above, today's dual clutch automatics and even torque converter equipped 8-speeds can and will out-shift Walter Röhrl on his best day -- do you think you can do better? (and besides the reason there are no stick shifts has already been explained and it is still YOUR fault).  The car you want in this era of virtual mass-customization probably does still exist. If you have to have analog steering with hydraulic assist, well, you'll probably have to buy a used car that may not have as many improvements as the 2015 or 2016 that you can buy off the lot, or better still order direct from BMW (or whoever).  Yes, yes, we should and hopefully will be permitted to continue, letting of steam: Wishin' and Hopin' for the good ol' days.  Gawd, some of us (and you know who you are) sound like my parents when I wanted to listen to the Beatles or Led Zep (or, heaven forbid, Pink Floyd): ""That's not music, its a bunch of barbarians, barbarians I tell you. Now Lawrence Welk, THAT's music Mark!""  If you (and you know who you are) just can't take the direction BMW is going, find something else and buy it. What I am concerned about (and often representative of) is our becoming a bunch of curmudgeons or maybe even Luddites.  Buying a 2005 fill-in-the-blank because that was the last year the arbitrary capillary was still used to keep the pressure evenly applied to the crank-knuckle, doesn't do anything for the advancement of the art and science of the automobile business (and we mustn't forget it is first and foremost a business).  All I am asking is that you (we) don't adopt my dad's approach to rock music in your descriptions of your disappointments with BMW or Audi or even Acura for abandoning us, the faithful -- dear old dad used to say this about rock music: ""Noise, Bohemian tripe, bang and twang over-loud, barbarians at the gates of hell!""  It gave me such great pleasure when I came home (from my first quarter of college) for Thanksgiving having gone without a haircut for nearly 5 months and blasting (I turned it up to 11):  ""You need cooling Baby, I'm not fooling I'm gonna send, yeah You back to schooling Way down inside Honey, you need it I'm gonna give you my love I'm gonna give you my love Wanna whole lotta love Wanna whole lotta love Wanna whole lotta love Wanna whole lotta love""  They don't make music like THAT anymore, eh?

So I did my part, yet they still changed that because others didn't.

2970,"March  2, 2015  7:08PM",markcincinnati," I'm not sure folks buy BMW's so they can appear to be an enthusiast -- I'm pretty certain a lot of BMW shoppers (and ultimately buyers) aren't really all that aware, even, of BMW's reputation in that regard.  I would suggest that for some BMW's have the reputation as being ""the best"" -- so someone lusts for a BMW for a few years and then when that first ""big jump"" in comp or first ""big hit"" in an investment banking transaction that they were part of gives them that high five figure or six figure bonus comes along, well they go for ""the best"" which they think is a BMW.  My suspicion is that someone buys (or leases) a Porsche because it will make them appear to be an enthusiast, or, perhaps even more likely, they really ARE an enthusiast.  Or, and I hope this isn't really the case, someone buys that RS7 or 911 to suggest a certain size attribute of a body part. Or, the car is acquired simply to demonstrate the size of your check-book balance.  I read an article about people who seek speeding tickets so they can brag -- obtusely -- about their income, as in ""I can afford that [speeding ticket]."" That's inane -- maybe even insane.  Yesterday we were out and about in snowy Cincinnati -- only 4-wheel drive vehicles seemed to be venturing out -- I saw an A8L and my comment was, ""I don't care how much money we have, how big the bonus is, etc, don't ever get an A8 for me."" Sure the car suggests something about the owner's income -- but were I to think about spending inordinate sums of money to haul my skinny (or fat, as the case may be) butt around (mostly with no one else in the car with me), my choice would be an S6 -- pretty much the ultimate sleeper car if you axe me. Probably only a very few would even know of its somewhat lofty price tag, as a matter of fact. But that's just me. My friend buys A8's and never has any passengers in them -- I am so tempted to inquire if he has more money than sense. I just keep my mouth shut.  The folks I [superficially] socialize with at either the BMW Store or the Audi Connection here in River City, actually seem to be very much into Audis and BMWs and cars in general. They know, sometimes, as much as the sales personnel, about all of the cars ""in the BMW or Audi family.""  My wife and I attended a 2-day driving school in Spartanburg SC with a group of folks from all over the US and most of them owned both BMWs and non-BMWs and were very much car aficionados of the highest order.  I'm thinking folks buy these cars because the cars have earned the reputations as being the best -- some folks may think that means the best performing, some may think most luxurious. I've never met anyone who bought one to ""look like they were a 'brand-name-here' enthusiast"" though.  But, I could be wrong."
2971,"March  2, 2015  7:35PM",roadburner,"  It's painfully obvious that you'd encounter enthusiasts at a driving event. You aren't going to meet the dweebs who talk about the ""powerful V6"" in their ""Beamer"" at the Performance Center or at a CCA HPDE."
2972,"March  2, 2015  7:42PM",benjaminh,"I have to admit that Audis and BMWs are beautiful cars, at least to me. They call out to me in a way few other cars do. MB, however, has lost me with their, to me, ""mean"" looking styling of late. But looking at the reviews of the local Audi dealer just now I came across this:  ""Currently have my Audi A4 in for repairs. It has 57,000 miles on it, and I will be walking out with a $5000+ repair bill. This is on top of $1500+ I spent on repairs in the last 7 months....""  Yikes! Acura stirs my emotions too, and part of that is the desire for reliability, durability, and low cost of ownership. If I want drama in my life I'll watch television or a movie. I don't need my car to give it to me lol!"
2973,"March  2, 2015  9:46PM",markcincinnati,"roadburner: You are, of course, correct -- for the most part those who attend driving events are enthusiasts and often well informed ones at that.  Earlier I had perhaps inartfully attempted to say that I noted the folks (customers) at BMW dealers did behave enthusiastically about BMWs and often cars in general and that I could not say the same was true at an Acura dealer (for instance). Even those ""dweebs"" who may incorrectly talk (gush perhaps?) about their BMW's V6 engines do continue somewhat to make the point -- the ""tone and tenor"" of the shoppers and buyers of BMWs and Audis is -- even when factually incorrect -- very much upbeat, excited and passionate.  The only thing I have ever seen, however, that even approaches the dweeby-ness you suggest is when someone at the Audi store asks me if my S4 (with the V6 T badge on it) has noticeable turbo-lag or some remark indicating they are unaware that Audis V6s are super, not turbo charged. I correct them, of course and they then ask me why Audi puts the ""T"" on both the super and turbo charged cars.  I give them the party line that is somewhat difficult to say with a straight face, we both shrug and I then tell them my S4 is both incredibly quick off the line and very fast thanks to the instantaneous response only a supercharged (or, granted, a naturally aspirated) engine can offer.  Even the dweebs are excited at the Audi and BMW store is the point -- the folks [shoppers] at Infiniti of Cincinnati and Columbia Acura, well, they're more concerned with things like ""can I run it on regular?""  Maybe I need to seek out a better class of dweebs."
2974,"March  2, 2015 10:16PM",benjaminh,"markcincinnati: Your thoughts on the different cultures surrounding each make seem to me to be perceptive, funny, and mostly on target. Acura does have its own subculture of nerds and devotees, I think, but they tend to be more subdued and, as you suggest, more ""practical."" Acura is in the midst of a renaissance, I believe, as their products are now more performance-oriented and more innovative. Its seems doubtful that they'll ever catch up to the enthusiasm and popularity of the top makes, but I think there's a chance they could get closer. Just like for every other make, there are fan sites for Acura too, and some of the people there seem quite knowledgeable:  http://acurazine.com/  Even though Leonard Nimoy famously participated in an advertisement for Audi along with Zachary Quinto, which I imagine everyone here knows, in my mind Acura is the more ""logical and rational"" luxury brand. Perhaps for some Acura lacks passion at times, but as a long time Star Trek fan I somehow imagine that Mr. Spock might approve of some of their cars, as well as of their legendary reliability and longevity. And for passionate design I think there are few supercars more exciting at the moment than the new Acura NSX:  http://www.acura.com/FutureVehiclesNSX.aspx"
2975,"March  2, 2015 11:20PM",markcincinnati,"It amazes me how quickly KIA (and specifically the Genesis ""brand"" on the other side of the house) has (or is it have?) started to make the case that they, someday, may give the current Premium Class members a rude awakening. As you might imagine, being an Audi loudmouth for so many years, I do participate in my share of (apparently) Audi sponsored surveys.  I was surprised to see the number of questions some of these surveys contain that clearly indicate the Germans (or maybe it is just Audi, I dunno) are concerned that some Korean mfgrs are ""breathing down their necks.""  Now, I said that last bit for emphasis, but there has been at least a seed planted in the German mfgrs minds that says, ""The Koreans are Coming, The Koreans are Coming"" (and of course I immediately add -- mentally -- ""Cover yourself with butter and carry lemons just in case. . .!"")  But seriously, I saw some TV show on Velocity (I think) where a new Genesis (V8) was compared to a Mercedes E-Class and a Volvo S60. Now, at the time, before the video rolled, I thought, ""Whose dumbass idea was it to compare these three; they're not even close, no one would ever cross shop them?!""  Turns out I was wrong -- the Genesis, although not exactly a great handling car, has had its suspension tuned by Lotus (sorta) and the thing had a very powerful and smooooooth V8 hooked up to an 8-speed transmission (plus it had all of the latest and greatest electronic safety aids and toys the Germans keep loading their cars with.) Considering that this 2nd gen Genesis was in its first model year, I had to marvel at how far they've come and how fast they've done it.  I did think, too, Lexus was literally a trim-piece brand (and where are they now? First Place? or at least close to it) -- there weren't even any Lexi in Japan, they were all just called Toyotas. Now, look at Lexus -- a legitimate force to be reckoned with even if generally speaking some (OK most, OK, all) enthusiasts never have taken to them or seen them as anything more than sofas on wheels. Few, even the haters, laugh at Lexus now. And they actually brought that spunky little dude, the IS 350 F Sport to market and pantsed a BMW 335 (look it up, if you don't believe me.)  It would be hard to argue that both the top of the line Genesis, Equus and KIA cars aren't making ""don't look back, those headlights gaining on you are Korean"" type sounds.  So why isn't it possible for Acura to, likewise, kick butt and -- eventually -- regain some of its premium-ness? Of course, I don't KNOW, know, but I think, it is because they have found a niche where they have been and are successful, they make reliable and durable cars, their cars are in some pretty cool Marvel movies and the halo car has sex appeal. Have a cigar (and by the way, which one's Pink?)  By the way, I do think the NSX will be a great ambassador for the Acura brand, I just am not sure I see someone rushing in and buying an RLX based on the fact that the NSX wears an Acura badge. The gap between the NSX and the TLX or even RLX is unlikely to be narrowed by an oooober expensive sports car -- if you axe me.  Mean time, Genesis and KIA cars are quietly gaining ground and buzzing around the Premium Club members -- and you know what? Pretty soon one of them will sneak its way in and, then, well, there goes the neighborhood.  Human sacrifice, dogs and cats living together... mass hysteria!  What next? Chrysler resurrects the Imperial?  We're headed for a disaster of biblical proportions.  Oh gawd."
2976,"March  2, 2015 11:31PM",graphicguy,"My track days are over. But, I still like a good handling car. I'm not nearly as critical between FWD/RWD/AWD as the current enthusiasts are. There was a time it made a difference (like running at mid-Ohio years ago). Just not so much any more.  These suspensions have become quite sophisticated. I do like the trick torque sensing rears of the Caddy, Audi, Acura. They truly allow rotation around any corner that really defies description.  I also like the current trend of tubo/supercharging smaller motors to get more power out of less displacement. I had a Saab turbo in the '80s. That one was ""hit the gas....wait for it....wait for it....BAM....steering wheel jerked out of my hand if I wan't holding on, and in the weeds you could go. Fun.....for about a week."

2978,"March  3, 2015  4:22AM",roadburner,"I have to say that I really did like Acuras up until the ""Beak"" design theme emerged- the RSX in particular.  As for the Koreans usurping the German throne, I'd think that won't be a possibility for some time. Having said that, I recall a column I wrote several years ago where I noted that the Optima Turbo was a very nice car- and while it definitely was not a sports sedan, neither was an F10 528i.  I also draw a distinction between ""enthusiasts"" and those who are merely ""enthusiastic."" The enthusiastic owner is like the person who gets behind a basketball team once they go deep in the NCAA Tournament- but is unable to name any of the starting five, never mind what position they play. There automotive counterparts are the owners with V6 Beamers; they think a port installed LSD is an intravenous hallucinogen and absolutely adore the electronic oil level sensor- that way they don't have to remember how to open the hood.. In contrast, an enthusiast at the very least knows the engine configuration of his/her car as well as which wheels are driven- and hopefully understands a few rudimentary handling terms.  Sad to say, I have noticed that several more ""mundane"" marques are attracting an increasing number of true enthusiasts- if not rabid gearheads. BMW seems intent on casting a larger net while using ""bait"" that is becoming more and more bland."

2980,"March  3, 2015  2:41PM",graphicguy,"RB....I look at the Korean manufacturers more as a curiosity than anything else. I would like to get some butt time in a new Genesis, given that they've supposed to have fixed the ""jittery"" suspension issues of the previous gen.  There seems to be this rush by BMW, Infiniti (with the Q), Mercedes to move closer to the middle, or to cast a bigger net, as you aptly put it. Audi has stayed pretty true to the luxury sports sedan mantra. And, a brand like Cadillac seems intent on taking care of the space that was vacated. In all frankness, I probably would have gone back to BMW after all the foibles with my S4. But, they transitioned into the F3x by then, and the drive to me was much less engaging with them. Plus, to get what I wanted, the prices really have sky rocketed on them to approx a $7K-$8K delta between my 335ix coupe and the just released 435ix equipped about the same way. Thanks but no thanks.  I really have become smitten with the ride/handling engineering of the ATS/CTS. The Mag Ride Control is the real deal. Never thought I'd say soemthing the size of my CTS as ""flingable"", but it is. It's just one of those cars that I look forward to driving every day....even love the looks of it....the quality of it...the build of it.  Still, I would like to get some seat time in the new Mustang GT or the Challenger with the Scat Pack. Not sure when, or even if I'd buy either. But can't say never. Never is a long, long time. It would be a 2nd (3rd?) car if I did."
2981,"March  3, 2015  7:03PM",markcincinnati,"Recently one (or more) of the ""big"" auto magazines (I think it was C&D) tested an old vs a new BMW. I assume the genesis of such a test was the ever growing brouhaha -- ostensibly from the faithful -- claiming the newer BMW's have lost some of their BMW-ness as BMW goes on the ""soich for more money!""  It seems, if memory serves, that the test reports demonstrated that the new BMW could better the old one in every significant (measurable) performance number.  Once again, since I am not, at this instant, in possession of the test report article, I could be mistaken. What I think I recall, however, is that despite the cries that BMW has forsaken the true believers, the numbers say otherwise.  I had been a die-hard manual transmission guy. Our Audis -- with the exception of my brand new 1997 A8 -- had always been manuals. My maxed out allroad (2003) had to be special ordered -- not that I probably wouldn't have anyway -- since the dealer simply did not stock stick shifts even back then. I couldn't believe Audi would simply no longer offer its cars with sticks (for the most part). The 2001 or 2002 A6 2.7T could be had with a stick but the same model with a 4.2 V8 was only offered with an automatic.  My wife's 2005 X3 had to be ordered, too, since there were virtually no X3's on the dealer's lot so equipped. As I recall we couldn't even test drive a stick BMW period.  When I got my 2005 A6, I knew I had probably enjoyed my last stick (the 2003 allroad 2.7T.)  Going on the hunt, I found that BMW did offer at least some stick shifts but there was little chance of finding one unless it was special ordered.  I now have a 7-speed DSG in my '14 S4. I, for the first time since 2003, don't miss the stick anymore.  Most people -- that I know, excluding my wife -- don't even know how to drive a stick, so I don't see much value in complaining about that, and, besides, the DSG is so much better at shifting than I ever was and the shifts don't feel like they're robbing power from the engine.  What we have today, if you believe Car & Driver (which I usually do), are better performing cars that have their performance characteristics available when you want them but invisible (for the most part) when you don't.  Yes, even Consumer Reports notes that an Audi [A6] is able to be sporty -- which I assume is somewhat of a statement that other brands (that they list) are not sporty.  I'm buying that today's fill in the blank (Audi, BMW, Mercedes & Porsche) automobiles are ""the best representations of sport sedans and CUV's ever on the market."" I'm, therefore, rejecting the notion that the old ones were better performers than the new ones. The fact that the brands have become more accessible to folks who don't think like I thought -- up until 2005 -- simply means the brands have the power to sustain themselves in the marketplace.  Even if I really thought a 10 or 12 year old M3 was somehow better than a new one, I am pleased that BMW has ""cast a wider net,"" for I fear had they not, they would be going or already have gone the way of the dodo.  The disdain so many have for sentimentality never ceases to amaze me -- my sentimental favorite car ever is my 1995 Audi S6 in pearl teal with a brilliant white leather interior. God I loved that car -- still have fond memories for it. It was, despite its being my favorite, no where near the car my 2014 S4 is -- the older S6 was, in perhaps every measurable way -- ""inferior"" to the new (or almost new) S4. My current S4 is the best car I have ever had, by a wide margin. I assume it would, in every measurable way, be crowned winna and champeen were it compared to the old S6 or even a last gen S4 (the one with the V8).  These cars that we talk about here and have strong opinions about are the best they have ever been (in every significant and measurable way). The fact that BMW or Audi now attracts folks who don't know that there isn't a V6 under the hood of their BMW is sad (for me at least); but, I would argue that the ignorant owner is just as desirable (as a customer) to BMW as the one who knows there is a turbo-charged inline-6 under the hood. In the end, car companies must put the soich for more money ahead of the soich for informed, appreciative and passionate customers. The way they go about selling more cars, however, is to build better cars that can be appreciated both by the true and pure disciples as well as the bourgeoisie.  Although I don't think the Koreans are TODAY too much of a threat to the world-order, I don't think we should dismiss them out of hand. They are making very rapid advances -- pretty soon they may find entry into the Premium Class (and by pretty soon I think we should be very watchful of the evolution of their products for the next 5 or so years.) I remember the first Toyotas that were imported (back in the 60's) -- made in Japan was, then, not much of a threat. It didn't take long until they were nibbling at US made market share, then they just started taking ever bigger bites until names like Toyota, Honda and Datsun were forces to be reckoned with.  I got into a new Genesis sedan -- it wasn't a Mercedes -- but honestly, I do think it was a very interesting attempt to convince ""you"" that it was worth a second look. Whenever the 3rd gen comes out, I would look for some serious suspension evolution which could go a long way toward making us take them more seriously."
2982,"March  3, 2015  8:03PM",roadburner,"Are you referring to this article? It concludes: the most significant change from the E90 to the F30 results from the switch to electric power-steering assist, which diminishes feel. Body roll in the two cars is identical, but the use of rear-suspension understeer instead of  larger tires in back may be why the new 328i feels less agile turning into corners. All of  it adds up to a softer, tamer 3-series that’s more about luxury than fun."
2983,"March  3, 2015  9:19PM",markcincinnati,"RB - No, The one I recall compared a new M3 to an old M3 (old being a relative term).  I do have a question - let's just say that the consensus of expert opinions favors the old over the new; what are consumers to do (assuming they want the car brand and model that has ""slipped"" during the transition from old to new)? If a 2009 BMW (or Mercedes, Porsche, etc) is superior to a 2015, many (perhaps most) consumers would still opt for the 2015 for reasons of reliability and durability (and factory warranty).  And, in the tests that I recall, the real performance differences between the old and the new are often only most noticeable above 8/10ths -- a place where few ever drive their daily drivers. So, even those who long for an E vs an F BMW or an Audi B7 vs a B8, etc, can't really go out and get a ""new"" E or B7; and, probably most of them want a 2015 not a 2008, 2009 or 2010.  I never had a V8 S4 -- and I'm told some were PO'd at Audi for changing to a super-charged V6. But I have nothing to compare my V6 T to in that regard, and hunting for a used S4 V8 is simply something I wouldn't even be interested in doing.  So the question is/stands: What can or will ""you"" (or the consumer) do? Seek out the ""better"" older version? Go to another brand? Take public transportation?  And, if newer models are actually better than the older versions and you just don't like the new ones, what will you do, boycott the company or fix and repair the old one until parts can no longer be found? Is moving to Cuba an option?"

The current crop of 3 series cars just doesn't do it for me the way its predecessor did. 3 years ago I made a financially dumb move and traded in my 2010 Acura TSX for a leftover 2011 BMW 328xi. I drove the car once and figured out a way to make it work by leasing the 328xi for 2 1/2 years. Fast forward to today. If I still had my Acura (yes I'm a card carrying member of Chronic Car Buyers Anonymous) and said to myself just as I did 3 years ago: ""You know what, the incentives on this 320xi or 328xd are really strong, I've always wanted a 3er, so let me take a test drive..."" I would have left the dealership with a cold feeling. 175 hp 4cyl engine is ok for me in my $25K Legacy, but 140 hp turbo 4 cyl wouldn't cut the mustard in a $40K BMW 320xi."
2985,"March  3, 2015 10:17PM",benjaminh,"Hard for even me to believe, but on the strength of SUVs Acura slightly outsold Cadillac and Audi for Feb:  Acura: 12,992 up 12.5% Cadillac: 11,739 down 12.6% Audi: 11,445 up 5.3%  Perhaps re: Acura it's time to cue up Monty Python: ""I'm not dead yet!"""
2986,"March  4, 2015 12:59AM",markcincinnati," I would assume you were not the target buyer of the car you bought/leased.  I know the Audi brand better so hopefully this is a reasonable parallel:  The new Audi A3 -- even the S3 -- is not at all attractive to me. The new Q3, likewise, doesn't do it for either my wife or me. I'd bet even the eventual RS Q3 will not be attractive to us. Maybe it is the size of the A3, maybe it is that it seems a class lower in terms of the materials used throughout the interior. I would, therefore, assume if I were to acquire an A3, even the Prestige quattro version with the most potent turbo-4, I would be working hard to figure out how to ditch it at the first opportunity.  Come to think of it, it probably isn't the size of the A3 or Q3, it is just that it seems too much like it is an Audi-light vehicle (and I'm not speaking of it's curb weight.) The CLA Mercedes and the BMW 1 series, likewise just don't do it for me. My wife was loaned a 1 series (and it had the turbo i-6) BMW -- I drove it, very powerful, but it seemed, somehow, ""cheaper"" in the materials it was made out of. The Q3, which we had for a day and a half earlier this year, didn't have the cheapness issue I noted in the A3, but it was way, way underpowered -- it felt like a Tiguan (doh! it is a fancy Tiguan, after all).  All of our Audis have felt at least adequately powered, so the current Q3 seems like it was pulled out of the oven before it was done. Maybe I'll change that opinion once the regular Audi 2.0T engine is in place.  The $50,000 S3 was twitchy, like a go cart is twitchy, it was noisy at speed on interstate 275, where I drive every day in my quiet S4. The vast expanse of black plastic on the dash looked like something out of the rental fleet at Budget, not something that the sales person has to say with a straight face: ""we can sell this one for $47,900!""  So, you leased a left over BMW that was probably meant for a younger, earlier in their earnings arc, customer. You paid too little, got too little and were underwhelmed.  On the other end of the scale, you may have been equally unhappy with an Audi A8 -- or BMW 7 series. These cars are developed with input from design, engineering, marketing, production/manufacturing and of course, finance. When deciding what to do, I would imagine those in charge decide ""there is a target market for an X5, an X3 and now an X1."" There's also a market, a narrow market I would imagine, for the X6.  Those $70,$80 and $90,000+ 4-door German coupes from Audi and Mercedes are not marketed, I would assume, to a 23-year old with a freshly minted MBA from Ohio State or a 25-year old who just completed his/her JD from the University of Cincinnati College of Law.  Is the wider net a good thing to do? I probably would have said no a couple or three years ago, but maybe now, the market is such that these premium makers want to get them (the customers) early (aka ""young"") and make certain there are upmarket models ""within the family"" to aspire to.  My sales rep at the Audi Connection told me his wife wanted a new Audi Q3 -- he had to carefully market and sell his wife first AGAINST the Q3 and then move her thinking to the Q5 or Q7, stopping along the way at the A4 based allroad. Why? Well, the Q3 was ""not enough car"" for her as a Fortune 500 executive with three children aged from 12 to 15, a big dog (her husband) and a border collie. The Q3 would have been a fine choice about 14 years ago.  And this guy sells cars for a living -- no longer are car sales people ""order takers"" (if they ever were).  Hopefully you get my drift -- your expectations and your ""situation"" were not a good match for the leftover BMW you leased -- and it was a disservice to you to not shepherd you through the buying process. I think you weren't given what you needed to make an informed decision."

2988,"March  4, 2015  4:09AM",nyccarguy,"@markcincinnati‌  Sorry for the confusion in my post. I wanted to write a little more, but got called away from my desk while eating lunch (happens A LOT since my name's on the door). While the time I spent with the E90 328xi was brief, it was nothing short of amazing.  I had wanted a 3 series ever since I drove a friend's 1995 E36 328is 5MT through the streets of Buffalo late one night into early one morning. The car was just perfect. It fit me like a glove. At the time I didn't have too much stick shift seat time, but by the end of the night I was rotating the car car around corners.  I liked my Acura TSX that I inherited from my wife when we bought a Pilot to accommodate our upcoming 3rd child (she's 3 now), but didn't LOVE it. I saw an ad for leftover 2011 328xi BMWs, crunched some numbers, test drove the car, & fell in love. An inflated residual, $2000 in trunk money, 2 additional $500 payment credits, plus a $500 BMWCCA rebate gave me enough ammo to convince my wife that I want it & it makes sense (and cents).  My experience with the current crop of F30 3ers came when I brought my brilliantly balanced 328xi in for service. I drove a 328xi, a 320xi, & a 320xd. Nice cars. Very smooth riding. I'll even go as far as saying the 328 was MUCH faster than my inline 6's 230 horsepower. The chassis seemed to be stiffer. As an enthusiast, I just had little idea of what was going on. The car felt very disconnected.  Since BMW has moved into making their cars softer, they lost the edge they had over competitors like Lexus.  The scene at your BMW dealership on Saturday AMs is how things should be. Waxing poetically about their respective BMW. The truth is that inflated residuals, free maintenance, & low lease payments are what fuels the BMW brand."
2989,"March  4, 2015  4:10AM",roadburner," As to your first question, I will either seek out an older version or go to another brand; I like the M235i but I balk at paying around $3000 to get a true mechanical limited slip in a car that already costs north of $40,000- especially when such an ""exotic"" technology is either optional or standard on the GTI, Miata, not to mention every V8 ponycar. The vanilla F10 and F30 leave me cold, regardless of their horsepower, and my opinion is shared by much of the US enthusiast press(remember when Automobile and Car and Driver were constantly accused of being biased towards BMWs? When is the last time a non-M model won a comparison test?). Now you are absolutely right; the wearers don't care, and Munich apparently no longer does either. Fortunately BMW M is still cranking out decent cars. I think the new M3/4 is a return to form; I liked the E9x V8 but it drove like the true successor to my bitterly missed E24 M6- more a fast GT than a true sports car like the E46 M3. Ditto for the M5; the E60 V10 iteration was just a mess- the new car feels like it has a little E39 DNA spliced in. I have no problem maintaining my 2 older BMWs- one thing BMW still does right is provide for older models; thanks to BMW Classic I can get virtually any part I need for my 1975 and 1995 BMWs at my dealer's parts counter. If it isn't in stock I rarely have to wait more than 2-3 days. And when I bring my 1995 Club Sport in for service I still get a loaner."
2990,"March  4, 2015  4:35AM",tlong," I had a '98 Audi A4 and loved that car - V6 with a 5 speed manual. It was without a doubt the best driving car I have ever owned - smooth, sharp, and shifted like butter. But I got rid of it earlier than any other car I have ever owned - at 88K miles. It was already nickel and diming me with semi-expensive repairs - primarily a cooling system issue that the dealer couldn't seem to resolve but at $750-$1000 per visit while they kept replacing parts - thermostat, fan clutch, etc. So I finally and grudgingly sold it and bought my current ride, an '05 Acura TL (now at 150K miles). The Acura has given me almost no trouble and it's a great car (and one of the good looking TLs rather than the later disasters), but it is still big and heavy and sloppy next to my A4. I really still do miss that Audi. But I really do like the reliability of my Acura."
2991,"March  4, 2015  5:32AM",flightnurse," Dude, you got to drive a 320xd? The only one imported into the US..."
2992,"March  4, 2015  6:25AM",flightnurse,"I'm gone for 2 days and this forum lights up...  First I laugh at people who criticize cars and brand after a short drive. Second, I pity the fool (in my best Mr. T voice) for criticizing cars without really driving longer then 1,2 or 8 days.  Lets look at the Geneses, Rick's Geneses has 65K miles on it, has only been in the shop for routine service. So basically flawless so far. So some of you say that people buy BMW's, MB's and Audi's because they want to prove something.. The Geneses is a very nice E class, for 2/3 the cost of a E class. I don't think anyone would say that the E class is a true sport sedan, and I wouldn't say the Geneses is one too, but after owning one for 3 yrs, I can say with fact that the Geneses is just as good as a MB E class or a BMW 528i (non line car.) Base price for those car's are 50K, a fully loaded Geneses can he had slight under 50K. The """"jittery"" suspension of the first Gen Geneses isn't a major issue, it's not a sport sedan and again it was never marketed as one. But if you were looking for a e class car, and price gave you a nose bleed, the Geneses was a great alternative.  Again on the comments about F3x, it's great people write reviews on these cars with limited real seat time, this doesn't make them ""experts."" Having 25K miles on mine, I have to say, this car has exceeded my expectation. This is why I'm looking at the F33 4 series Grand Coupe, I wish BMW would import the 435d, this would blend power and efficiency to a whole new level. But I'll take the 435i, however, when I'm ready to order my car it will be the 440i. Are the new F3x cars softer then the E series, yes, the ""true"" enthusiast can not keep BMW and Porsche in business so they had to do something to get a larger pool of people. I mean, for the people who buy the CPO cars, how does this keep the manufactures open? They don't, they keep the dealers open, it's the people who purchase new cars are the one who keep the manufactures open. I had always said, the E39 5 series was the perfect size car, and the F30 is slightly smaller then the E39. So BMW has been working on the EPS (elec power steering) to get the feel back, this would shut up some people. I just got back from a trip, slightly over 400 miles, I averaged 36 mpg, no one complained about cramp rear seats, and the ""numb"" steering wasn't an issue in which I couldn't control the car going up and down the mountain roads of southern AZ.  This is why Rick is getting a F34 328i GT, the car still has a very German ride to it, much more then his Geneses, the rear seats have more room then his Geneses and or a 5 series. Not everybody want a ride that is so stiff that there is a risk of losing their fillings. Since all GT's are xDrive, we are getting the Dynamic Handling Package this allows to have greater control in the x Drive cars when either the Sportline or M Sport lines are ordered (Rick is getting a Sportline GT.)"

2995,"March  4, 2015  1:56PM",graphicguy,"tlong....for a long time, it looked like the two of us were carrying the Acura banner. It's up to you now.  Actually, I may end up with another TLX sometime, but probably for my wife. Aside from the fact that I do believe they offer great value in the ELLPS space, they just don't break. And, they don't cost an arm and a leg to maintain. I do like the looks of the new TLX, but I also liked the previous version, too.  Driving my wife's Accord, and driving (albeit breifly) a new TLX, I can tell the differences immediately between the two. Most of it is underneath, though. SH AWD and some obvious thought given to the suspension in the TLX and sound deadening, it's a different and better drive in the TLX.  Not everyone will see it that way, though. They'll look a the dual screens on the dash and the motor similarities between the Accord and the TLX and declare the Accord to be the better value.  Accords are nice, sporty, mainstream cars that are cheap to own and fix. The Acura is all those things too. But, it handles better, rides better, steers better, has better materials inside and out. And, if you want, a torque vectoring rear in their SH AWD version. Can't get those things in an Accord.  Playing devil's advocate for a moment, a neighbor bouight an Accord Hybrid a few weeks ago. LOVES IT. Drives and handles like a regular Accord while getting 40 MPG. Impressive.  My wife is all about MPG. IF she doesn't get a TLX, it will probably be another Accord, but a Hybrid."

We got 51.7 mpg with the last tankful, actual calculated mpg's. This is in all no-econ mode, and about 30% highway. Granted, we can expect a decrease this summer when the a/c is going, but for this size car with all its (Touring model) luxury features, is quite impressive. While hardly a performance machine, it is surprisingly fun and not a slug to drive as we found was the case with the Fusion Hybrid.  Sorry for the digression from this forum."
2997,"March  4, 2015  4:32PM",andres3," The S4 has been guzzling gas in the city/freeway traffic I drive in lately. I take short trips, lots of traffic lights, and I can see less than 20 MPG with my lead foot in the S4. I'm not happy about that, but I know it is possible to get 30 MPG in the thing if you maintain a constant high velocity over large distances, and I'm very happy about that.  Different driver, different results, but what kind of spectacular MPG did you get in your TL - SH AWD? To be fair, since the S4 is more powerful, it does tend to make a driver use that power more often IMO. More power = less fuel economy."
2998,"March  4, 2015  4:44PM",andres3," I think the 1.8 A3 is the lease special fleet queen badge buyer edition. Any car person in their right mind would pony up the extra $3K for a better, stronger engine that actually has better fuel economy to boot. In other words, the 2.0T is better than the 1.8T in every measurable way except weight.  I know that makes the price gap larger, but that would be the more realistic comparison in my mind. Hey, I compared a TL-AWD to an S4 and opted to pay nearly $15K more for the S4."

On the TL-SH-AWD it felt FWD and when you gassed it, you could feel, AND see even graphically on the screen how it shifted some torque rearward, but most of it always started out in front.  Just one more reason why I felt the S4 was worth the extra dough."
3009,"February 27, 2015  2:42AM",sweendogy,I would say the best reason to get rid of the TL was its awful looks- people can talk about how close it was to the s4 but in actuality it wasn't - ugly fat and boring - no way to go thu life.

I've owned both the S4 and the TL SH AWD. TL SH AWD is mighty close to the Audi. No, the TL wasn't as fast as the S4, but it was every bit as adept in the handling dept and was very confidence inspiring to drive. It matched the S4 in the feature category. Service costs on the TL vs the S4 were miniscule in comparison. MPG was certainly better on the TL vs the S4, too. And, for the money I paid (under $40K) for the TL SH AWD Advance it offered huge value.  Don't get me wrong, I liked my S4. Didn't like the reliability (lack thereof) of the S4 and didn't like the MPG, nor the maintenance costs, either."

3015,"February 28, 2015  6:17PM",markcincinnati,"I did like my TL SH-AWD Advance. I thought it was ugly, and the interior looked like a Honda that knew somebody. The air conditioned seats were great. The power was good, nothing to scare an S4. The brakes were very weak. The doors sounded tinny when closed. It was a beer to the Audi's champagne. Yet, much as most folks would never cross shop these two, it was Honda's bargain basement S4.  I have to assume the new TL is an improvement. Mine, a 2012, had way too much FWD feel (torque steer), something the S4 doesn't have.  I don't have the S's sport diff (torque vectoring rear diff), wish I did, but I would assume if I did, I'd love this thing even more.  This car and my wife's SQ5 have become our favorite Audis and our favorite cars -- and we've had dozens -- of all time. I want to say nothing even comes close -- but our BMW's have been close (and even a couple VW's were a blast to drive, but still none are the performers of these S's.) I used to think they (Audi S cars) were too expensive, but compared to 3-series, well it seems these Audis are ""within reach"" of most folks who shop and buy the cars discussed on this forum.  If you ""can't see"" or ""don't share"" our (my wife's and mine, i.e.) passion for the Audi S's, I would say the TL or TLX SH-AWD with anything that increases the performance/handling ticked off on the option list, is not a bad alternative (if you can get past the styling and the Honda content.) But, for the money, the Acura may be attractive to you because it will almost certainly stay south of $50K..  If you can't stomach the TLX's looks and the Audi leaves you wondering what I see in them, well, the C class Mercedes, too, looks like it is worth a second look -- and I've always had a soft spot for the Volvo S60 type R.  An observation: many who write here about their cars make remarks like ""my TL gave me 6 trouble free years."" My irreverent side almost always reads, ""my TL gave me 6 [bland, boring, unremarkable, invisible] trouble free years."" If I remarked to my wife that she has given me 20 plus years of trouble free cohabitation,"" she'd have every right to punch me in the nose.  I want 6 trouble free years, too, but I think I'd take 3 spectacular driving experience years instead.  That's why I always say: Drive it like YOU live.

3016,"February 28, 2015  7:16PM",markcincinnati,"Some may recall that when I wanted to go ahead and get a 2014 Lexus IS350F with every option box ticked off (in metallic white with red leather), my wife said, ""we tried the Infiniti and the Acura, it just seems that they ain't got no soul . . . "" We test drive cars and seek out new restaurants as damn near professions as any hobbies could ever be -- so when it came time to drop the Acura and Infiniti, we seriously went into test driving as THE weekend event for a few months.  Here is what we noticed: Audi, BMW, Porsche and (to a lesser extent) Mercedes owners participate in ""clubs,"" attend driving schools, take road trips en masse, make trips to Germany to visit the Holy Land (the factories where their cars are made) and spend a fair amount of their disposable incomes on logo'd shirts, coats, key-fobs, ball caps, wrist watches, wine glasses, beer mugs and other branded memorabillia. Acura, Infiniti and Lexus owners? Not so much.  So, maybe my wife was onto something -- data points suggest the above mentioned Germans attract buyers and have owners who are passionate (they have soul perhaps?) about their favorite car brands. Other than some key fobs and a narrow selection of ball caps, only the local Infiniti dealer even had a Branded Boutique of items touting their owners love of their brand's cars.  The BMW store, in Cincinnati, offers free car washes -- so what you say? Well, arrive at the BMW store bright and early on a Saturday morning and you will see a line of BMW's, perhaps 20 cars deep, waiting to be hand washed -- sometimes the wait is hours. The customers park their cars, take a claim ticket from the attendant and gladly walk up to the service center's lounge where there is free Starbuck's coffee, all kinds of beverages and snacks and even portable DVD players and headphones with a choice of movies. Often the folks chat about their adventures in their X5's or the pleasure they had picking up their cars in Spartanburg and driving back to Cincinnait. Some folks regale others about their European delivery pick up in Munich and the fun they had driving on the autobahn.  Sitting in the Acura waiting area didn't even come close -- and there was no waiting room at the Infiniti dealer.  Somehow, the Germans seemed to have cracked the marketing code to imbue their cars, dealerships and, most importantly, their customers with passion -- soul -- for their fantastic creations.  As the sign at the BMW dealer reminds: ""Don't Forget to Breathe!""  Me? I'm heading over to the quattro cafe to check out what's in the fridge and what's playing on the big screen TV.

If you want to spend some time in your new BMW on the autobahn while heading toward one of the best little towns on the planet, I urge you to drive about 45-60 minutes south of Munich to Garmisch-Partenkirchen, spend the night in the magnificent Hotel Reindl Partenkirchner Hof -- make absolutely sure you make dinner reservations at the hotel's restaurant, or risk being turned away -- the meal at this restaurant is worth planning, scheming and dreaming for.  The next day you can take the ski-lift up (and in July the view will be spectacular) where the 1936 winter Olympics were held. Then you can take another even more breathtaking cable car ride up the Zugspitze where you can have lunch and walk from Germany to Austria as the border cuts through the mountain. If you have time -- and I would urge you to make time -- you can drive your new BMW to Füssen and visit Neuschwanstein Castle.

Previously it wasn't very competitive at the entry level, but now I think it is. The most direct competitor is the 2015 Audi A3 1.8. Both are good cars, but here are few comparison points....  2016 ILX base $27,900 msrp 0-60: 6.2 (according to C & D) hp 201 trunk: 12.3 8 speed DSG 29 mpg comb  2015 Audi A3 1.8 $29,900 msrp 0-60: 6.5 (C & D) hp 170 trunk 10 6 speed DSG 27 mpg  Each one has advantages and disadvantages when it comes to standard equipment. The A3 has standard leather, standard XM in a better standard stereo, and split folding rear seats, none of which comes standard on the ILX.  But the ILX has standard the following things that I think are lacking on the base A3: moonroof, heated seats, LED headlights, rearview camera, smart entry/putshbutton start, USB port, 2 years longer power train warranty, Siri Eyes Free, etc.  Obviously somewhat difficult to compare, but I'd say that the ILX standard things are ""worth"" substantially more to me than the standards on the A3.  If you add a moonroof, pushbutton start, heated seats, back up camera, etc. to the A3 then the price seems to inflate to c. $36k or so. But the Acura model that would compete with that would be the ILX premium which is c. $30k msrp. That is a significant price difference.  The Audi has a lot more prestige than the Acura, but the ILX is likely to be more reliable and have a lower cost of ownership than the A3.  Yes, the ILX is based on the Civic, but then the A3 is based on the Golf, and so I don't see much of a difference there.  Both are good cars, but I do think that Acura is back in the game with the 2016 ILX."
3023,"March  1, 2015  3:59PM",ab348," Well, time will tell. The outgoing model consistently lost every comparison test to the Buick Verano, much less the A3. Once the usual car magazine introductory hype dies down it will be a better time to assess."
3024,"March  1, 2015  5:06PM",markcincinnati,"Few A3's (at least in our climate in SW Ohio) will not be quattros. Also, I would think there won't be that much cross shopping of these two cars -- and I admit there is a good chance I am wrong.  There is something special about German cars -- eloquently described elsewhere by both the pro-writers and us amateurs -- that makes me think most ""Audi"" shoppers will first cross shop the other Germans, then perhaps another European brand, then, maybe, a Japanese brand.  I asked the Audi dealer who (the brand) they compete with. The answers depended on the car, of course, but the A3 and ILX were never mentioned in the same sentence. Now, granted, this is a data point; and this is perhaps indicative only of Cincinnati shopper's habits. The names (brands) brought up included BMW (doh!), Mercedes and Porsche -- the Macan vs the Q5/SQ5 for instance.  Acura's today inhabit that unenviable position where Audi used to live: Acuras are Hondas when spoken of; Audis used to be Volkswagens as recently as 20 years ago. It wasn't until Audi moved farther and farther away from being a VW that knows somebody, that they were able to break into the Premium class. Acuras, so I thought, had made some pretty good inroads into no longer being ""fancy"" Hondas -- remember the RLX from the not too distant past? Now, they've slipped -- and for all I know the slippage is deliberate -- and gotten closer to their Honda roots. Simultaneously, Honda has kept moving forward and upward at a pace that Acura has apparently not been willing or able to keep pace with.  Don't get me wrong, I can't pinpoint something with respect to my 2012 TL SH-AWD Advance that I can blast other than its ugly beak. Yet, just the reaction to the car itself was underwhelming. No one ever seemed to have any curiosity about my TL. The day I drove my new S4 into the office, however, folks were all over the thing, asking questions and showering it with praise.  The point is folks here in Cincinnati at least will fawn over a BMW, Mercedes, Porsche or Audi and will hardly give an Acura or Infiniti the time of day. The Lexus IS 350 F sport, however, will attract car buffs and elicit questions -- as will a Cadillac ATS.  Maybe it's just that Cincinnati is a German town -- sister city to Munich, after all -- but at this point in time, Acura's just can't get no respect. I think were I somehow in a Bizarro world shopping for an ILX, I'd probably run, not walk, to the nearest VW dealer and look at a new VW CC R-line instead."
3025,"March  1, 2015  6:06PM",benjaminh,"markcincinnati: You make some good points. But for those who don't need the prestige of the German makes, or to have their cars talked about, Acura might be a choice again now. Maybe a small part of the lack of buzz for Acuras in your area is that they are actually made right in Ohio lol? Once the Acura NSX is launched later this year, might it inject a small amount of buzz into the brand?"
3026,"March  1, 2015 10:01PM",markcincinnati,Of that I am certain.
3027,"March  2, 2015  1:50PM",graphicguy,"I don't know that I'd go so far as to say there's something special about German cars. I think after you own cars for awhile, and you've owned lots of brands/models, you see the differences in materials, engineering, build to be differentm, but not necessaily better, from one marque to the next.  Granted, BMW and Mercedes seem to do things differently than say Acura, or Infiniti (and certainly different than Cadillac). For example, try using the shifter in the BMW 5 Series or the column dhifter in most Mercedes. You kind of go....""who thoguht that was a good idea?"".  Audis better in that regard. But still, there seems to be a level of complexity in the German makers that isn't really necessary. Never owned a Mercedes, but in my Audi and BMWs, I attribute that to why maintenance and repairs are so high compared to an ATS, or CTS, or TL, etc. Does it make a BMW, Audi or Mercedes better? I've yet to see any evidence of that.  All that said, I do understand the appeal of BMW. I liked the ones I had, quite a bit. The dealerships are top notch. Their cars, while moving away from what I want in an ELLPS, are still top dogs in the category.  Lots of competition in the space, though. Plenty for everyone to choose from. And, they're all good entries in the space."
3028,"March  2, 2015  3:43PM",roadburner,"Enthusiasts used to buy BMWs because they were great cars. Now many new buyers select a BMWs so that they appear to be an enthusiast- like the clown I met at my dealer's F30 intro; he informed me that ""I like automatics- I want to get in the car and not have to do anything."" (And I'm not slamming automatics- I'm slamming that pathetic reason for owning one)  I'm seeing more and more friends in the CCA(many of whom are long-time members) moving to 911s, Caymans, and CTS-Vs or V Sports- not to mention Boss 302s or Z06s."
3029,"March  2, 2015  5:35PM",markcincinnati,"While I do love a debate even a non-mean-spirited argument, I perhaps should perhaps attempt to clarify at least some of my previous comments in response to: "". . . for those who don't need the prestige of the German makes, or to have their cars talked about . . . .""  I am certain there are indeed car buyers who buy a brand for ""prestige."" There are perhaps business people who believe they must wear Armani suits, Prada shoes and sport Rolex watches on their wrists, and drive ""appropriate to their station"" autos for at least the reason that their clientele expect it of them. We may have become more shallow as a group of people overall (those of us in much of the world, not just the US); that is a debate for another place and time. The thing is, the folks [executives, C-level folks and VPs on up the chain] who hire corporate lawyers, CPAs, brokers, investment bankers, architects, interior designers, consultants and so forth would probably have different perceptions of the professional they were about to engage or the senior manager they were about to hire based on some of the candidates accoutrements.  Perception is reality so the saying goes.  You may be correct that a top o' the line KIA or Equus is virtually every bit as competent and luxurious as an S class, 7 series or A8L, but the market perception isn't there yet.  The point is not that someone may buy the car for the prestige -- although they may -- the point is that some force (""may the force be with you"") has imbued your Rolex watch with certain ""characteristics"" that set it apart from my beautiful, equally functional and competent-as-a-timepiece Tissot.  Given a choice, better yet, we've [all] learned that given a choice of being gifted with a new Impala LTZ or a somewhat like-sized BMW 5 series, we ""should"" pick the BMW. In the same vein, given a choice of an Acura RLX or a Mercedes E class, well, the Mercedes will be chosen over and over.  These assignments of prestige were earned somehow (weren't they?)-- is it possible it is because the E class or BMW or whatever has earned a reputation for inherent goodness and/or desirability and value that the RLX just can't compete with?  I don't know why an individual thinks they ""need or don't need"" prestige in their attire, car they drive, club they belong to or college they attend. I don't even care, really. What I am on about is how the thing -- that objet d'art -- perhaps got to be that way.  BMW's for example, may -- today -- no longer be the performance machines worshiped by some from an historical perspective. Perhaps BMW and the other [snooty?] Germans [and the people who buy them?] are simply resting on their laurels. Perhaps they are the naked emperors now. I wouldn't bet against them quite yet, however.  Perhaps Acura, Infiniti and Lexus (soon to be displaced by KIA, don't you know) will be dubbed the new Premium players by the cognoscenti of cars at Automobile, Car & Driver, Motor Trend, Road & Track and yes, even Consumer Reports. Look at the new CR magazine (best and worst car issue) and see where the Audi A6 comes in, just for the fun of it.  Most of us don't need our cars to be talked about. None of us wants our cars to be talked about as a negative reflection of us, however. But, we certainly don't mind if our cars (and the other stuff I mentioned above) paints us in a light that is positive. The real estate sales person who takes you around looking at houses in her new Q7 or Escalade may -- for good reason, who knows? -- make you feel like a winner compared to the sales person who drives you around in his obviously not new Chrysler 300. The lawyer who -- well you get the picture -- gives you confidence is probably the one who appears by some societal/cultural measure to be successful.  People need what they perceive they need -- and part of that perception of a given product comes from something the product has done to earn a certain reputation (prestige, some measure of prestige or lack of prestige altogether).  Cars are where they are due to many factors -- Acuras, not to pick on them, do not ""suggest"" the same thing as BMW's, for instance. You may or may not call that prestige, performance, price or even presence. Today, it is very, very likely that given a choice of a new Acura or BMW, ""most people"" will choose BMW.  The names Acura, Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Porsche, Cadillac, Lexus, Toyota, etc, etc, etc could have been used as substitutes in some of the preceding. It is not my intention to savage Acura or inordinately praise BMWs. Personally I am an Audi fan of the highest order. Between my wife and myself, we have owned American, German and Japanese cars since 1969 (mostly German, full disclosure). My experience with Acrua was, overall, positive -- and my TL was, in my estimation, Acura's somewhat successful imitation (bargain) Audi S4. I have no axe to grind with Acura, that is.  However, therefore, notwithstanding: I do notice that I am accorded certain societal, er ""perks"" when I wear my Breitling watch vs my Swiss Army and when I wear a certain designer sport coat vs Jos A Banks and when I arrive in an Audi vs an Acura or Infiniti. It's also better to be sporting a Mont Blanc pen instead of a Cross. It's better to be using an iPad than an Acer, And, it is better to order Ornellaia than E. & J. Gallo.  It just seems that we have arrived at a point in time where the Germans -- for whatever reason -- rule. Cadillac is on the rise, Acura is on the wane and both Infiniti and Lexus need to further rationalize their offerings, although Lexus seems to be doing just fine, thank you very much.  Just remember, good is the enemy of great.  Acura makes good cars.  More's the pity."

3039,"February 22, 2015  5:59PM",markcincinnati,"I have to assume the Q50 has been an underwhelming sales performer -- hence lease subvention to the rescue.  I still see plenty of the Q50's predecessor, the G37X, on the road -- and they have kept the thing alive as a Q40.  I also see plenty of the larger Infinitis on the road -- but the Q50s sit and sit and sit on the dealer's lots.  My wife says they are soul-less machines. I actually like the Q50's styling -- but the engine is basically unchanged from the previous G's and the transmission isn't as good of a partner as you could want and as you certainly expect -- at MSRP. But subvented, well the mo/pay has to make the Q50 attractive.  I always thought of BMW as the German Infiniti -- perhaps the incentives will gin up some greater enthusiasm for the Brand and the model.  Maybe there's something rotten in Hong Kong (or Tokyo); maybe that's why Audi's former US President spent to little time with Infiniti and jumped to Cadillac before the paint in his new Hong Kong office dried."

3047,"February 24, 2015  3:21PM",kyfdx," Yes.. I am saying that they are a great value to lease at $350 compared to the purchase price. So cheap, that you'll be many thousands worse off by buying the car, then selling it after three years.  Infinitis often have great lease programs that aren't in line with their actual resale value. It's the manufacturer's method of heaping big incentives on the car. It's not a general lease vs. buy argument. It's specific to the situation."
3048,"February 24, 2015  7:53PM",graphicguy,"It's too bad that Infiniti has had troubles in the sales arena. They used to make some fairly appealing sport-luxury vehicles. Now? Not so much.  Acura went through this 4 years ago. It seems they've righted the ship with the new TLX.  But still, it's a tough row to hoe when you swing and miss with a product redesign.  The fact that they're still selling the previous G series speaks volumes about how the Q 50 is doing. I test drove a Q50 a couple of times. Not sure the objective they were trying to meet, but whatever it was, they missed badly."
3049,"February 24, 2015 10:56PM",markcincinnati,"A sub-vented lease can be a better deal than buying for many folks.  Years back, Jaguars leased for STUPID numbers (very very low per month) -- the cars were discounted, but not enough to justify NOT leasing. The odd thing is the leases were closed ended which meant there was no risk for the person who leased with respect to residual value.  Here's how they did it (or at least how it was done by some mfgrs):  The lease price of the car is the cost of the use of the car for X months (lets say 24 or 36). To determine the lease, the financial arm went ahead and jacked up the residual value of the car to something IMPOSSIBLE let's say 70% of MSRP. Then they took the 30% of MSRP and divided it by 36 or whatever to come up with a crazy, artificially low (sub-vented) lease price per month. In some cases what they did was purchase an insurance policy to guarantee the 70% or at least some part of the 70%. Then they made the lease have a get out early penalty that pretty much meant you had little choice but to keep the car the full 36 months or you would pay through the nose. In some cases you actually had to keep the car -- you could NOT simply make the remaining payments to get off the hook.  Yet, for those that wanted an $80,000 (pick a car) for $399 per month with no money down, there was simply no way a purchase made any sense.  Now, Infiniti certainly does sub-vent, but not crazy crazy like the above mostly true example. The payment for the use of the car is indeed artificially low, but remember you are paying for the sub-vented cost of use of the car (which is less than you would pay had you purchased the car up front).  Then at the conclusion of the lease there is MAYBE the possibility of getting the car for its real, honest, market value -- not the bloated, made up residual. If the car is good and you can get it at real true market value in month 25 or 37 or whatever, you actually did get a good deal since all you paid for was the rental amount for the past 24 months anyway and it was, er, ""rent controlled.""  Infiniti's can be a bargain when they are helped along via the finance arm via a sub-venting process. As far as Acura's are concerned, their financial arm hasn't always been a flexible in that regard -- but perhaps it is because they didn't need to with the MDX being the lion's share of their business.  It seems to me the TLX (and I come from a TL and actually liked it) was/is a missed opportunity to de-Honda-ize the brand. At this point, however nice they are, they are, underneath, Prime Hondas. That is not a bad thing, but the thing that I always thought about Infiniti was that they really did attempt to build a car that could rival a BMW. Acuras are still sold as FWD vehicles (a big mistake if you axe me), the Infiniti in question here is, actually, really and truly, a rear wheel drive vehicle that can be had with AWD (very BMW-ish, there).  Moreover, don't go thinking Lexi are much more of an engineering tour de force vis a vis Toyota as Acuras are compared to Hondas.  But, so it seems, the market has spoken and the Infiniti cars are not the leaders of the pack, more like the laggards of the pack -- hence super-sub-venting to the rescue which may move more of them off the lots until a new and improved version can be screwed together for your inspection.  We bought our first car last year a $65,000+ Audi SQ5 -- we put $22,000 down, have a 2.25% APR note on it and it is now showing at being worth about $48K. We still owe $33K on it. We've lost, in my estimation, $7K -- had the thing been offered with a sub-venting finance package on a lease, well, that would have been a no-brainer. We're hoping the plummeting cash value of the car will, in year two, hit the brakes and that maybe we'll have a point in time where the car ""feels"" like it was a better decision to buy than to lease.  We'll see how it goes.  Meantime who cares what the car's MSRP is? Not most Americans. They, er, WE, only really care about the monthly payment.  When a $50K+ car can be had for $399 per month for the life of its warranty and then simply dropped off with no muss, no fuss, well that hardly seems like a BAD thing. Speaking of sub-venting, Cadillac is doing the same thing with their CTS and ATS and XTS vehicles as we speak."
3050,"February 25, 2015 12:18AM",flightnurse,"  I think Acura still have problems, their two best sellers are the MDX and RDX, the MDX is long in the tooth and really isn't competitive in the market (but the lease payments are lower then the competition) and the RDX just got another refresh.. I liked Acura better when they had the Legend and Integra."
3051,"February 25, 2015 12:52AM",stickguy,"the MDX was just fully redesigned for 2015 (or was it 2014?). How did that get long in the tooth already? Plus I thought it was selling quite well. The RDX came out for 2013, so this is the normal time for it's mid-cycle refresh.  I wonder what the sales are on the TLX? I don't recall seeing any #s. It is a nice car, and certainly a good value. And $$ speak. I also think the refreshed 2016 ILX is going to help that model immensely. The RLX, however, is a lost cause."
3052,"February 25, 2015 12:59AM",graphicguy," No disagreements with you or Mark. Test driving the Q50, it was like they couldn't make up their mind whether they wanted it to be a sports sedan or a luxury sedan and ended up with neither.  Acura is moving to the soft side like it seems every other alleged ELLSS (with the exception of Audi and Cadillac) is heading....soft. Still, Acura TLX is going to sell 45,000 TLXs in '15. Is there enough of a delta between an Accord and the TLX? Not sure. Drove a TLX. It drives differently from my wife's Accord. Enough to justify the price difference? I still like them. $45K at the tippy top end for a technologically rich, 6 cyl with AWD and torque vectoring rear seems pretty compelling."

3055,"February 25, 2015 12:42PM",robr2,Acura sold 2900 TLX's in January compared to 1400 TL's and 900 TSX's in January 2014 - so about a 25% jump compared to the old models it replaces.
3056,"February 25, 2015  2:09PM",graphicguy,"I just saw that the Honda President was either fired or resigned recently due to the airbag recalls, under reporting crash data, and a couple of other things. The article I read said he had navigated Honda/Acura through the Global recession, the tsunami in Japan (where a lot of vehicles were lost and manufacturing facilities were destroyed) as well as some other catastrophies.  I guess this means they don't really care what monumental obstacles you face, deliver to the bottom line or your gone.  Personally, I think Honda got away from what they did best with Acura. That is, be a leader in engineering, performance, design, technology and value in the luxury vertical. RLX (and the RL before that) hasn't been relevant for over a decade. As good as the TL is/was, it was not the most handsome car on the road. The new one is better. Acura really didn't have an answer for the Integra's demise.  By default, they became a luxury SUV company. It seems past those who view an Escalade as having ""made it"", the MDX is the lux SUV of choice with the upper middle class. I still like their products. Whether it was because they never did recover from the tsunami, they felt their brand would be better served by moving more towards the middle of the market, or whether they lost their desire to lead, they seem to just be missing the mark with their cars. I hope they continue to fire products at the segment because it's hard to find cars that are as well built, drive so nicely, are as bulletproof reliable, and are good values as my Acuras were. Unfortunately, that's not enough these days."
3057,"February 25, 2015  3:35PM",ab348,"I remember late '90s/early '00s, I thought of Acura as an aspirational brand, out of my price range at the time but something I might consider later on when I could afford one. Now they are not on my radar nor are they in any way appealing."
3058,"February 25, 2015  3:58PM",graphicguy,"I just saw a blurb last night that I think came from CR. Now, aside from appliances and lawn mowers, for which I seek out their ratings, for cars I don't use them all that much.  That said, they made a point that they liked the Buick Regal GS as a better luxury sports sedan than they do a BMW 328i. Pretty big leap there. But it does show how the American brands are roaring back into the Luxury/Sport arena.  I mentioned in another thread that the IS350 F Sport would have been on my radar before I pulled the trigger on the CTS. I was at the auto show locally last weekend and found the Lexus to feel a bit claustrophobic. The GS350 F Sport was much more to my liking.

3060,"February 14, 2015  6:01AM",markcincinnati,"""I'm not worried about it. When the DSG oil gets too hot, I know the transmission will go into limp mode, that happened late in my A3's life after I had a bunch of mods on that one. Usually happened when you got near the last lap of a session, but it was annoying nonetheless. Given the R8 has switched and upgraded to a dual clutch DSG unit, I think they've resolved any issues with the DSG and power/torque. I'm not too worried about it. I think they know most RS7 buyers aren't planning to track it, so they made it a slushbox transmission."" I don't know -- and with all due respect, I don't know how you know -- about Audi deciding the RS7 customer would not track the car, hence they (Audi) decided not to use the transmission that they typically tout as the one they reserve for their high performance cars. It is as if their engine technology advanced more quickly than their transmission supplier could keep up with, so they used the 8-speed tip instead of waiting for the DSG to get strong enough to handle the power of the RS7 motor.  I have no problem at all with you upgrading your engine, knowing that the transmission will attempt to protect itself when it is pushed beyond its comfort zone. I don't have the money that it would take to self insure against the risk.  Frankly, I think it would be less costly to get a new ""S"" with the uprated engine -- when it comes out perhaps as a 2016 -- rather than push the DSG with the upgrade.  Of course, if you upgrade and nothing untoward goes down, well your risk will have been proven to be low.  My experience with ""chipping"" is perhaps why I am concerned -- I chipped my wife's TT and the power and acceleration were thrilling -- but the damn thing went from being reliable (and I assume durable) to needing constant visits to the dealer for things that seemed to have started coincidentally with the chip's installation.  My wife swore (and I couldn't counter her argument) that all the ills that beset her TT were chip related.  We traded the car in for a newer TT with the FACTORY upgrated engine -- the thing was bullet proof.  Summary: good luck and godspeed with your upgrade. I'll just wait for the factory to offer up an amped up S car without any post OEM help."

If anything though, I felt they over advertised the power improvements , or at least overstated them, didn't pass the butt dyno.  I can understand being soured to tuning if you've had issues in the past. However, if the car was old, maybe it was just due to have those same failures anyway? Also, what kind of tune (company?) was it. I got Unitronics with the A3, and part of their sales spiel is that they tune it with OEM like reliability and durability in mind. Of course, my S4 tune will be Revo, so new territory. I find the Audi components to be over engineered so that they can handle these tunes with ease if done right."

Its just all so convoluted so they can list whatever they want. They decide they want to mention a particular car, so they make up yet another category for it.

The storm was Sunday - started out with about 8-10"" of snow, then changed to rain for an hour or so, then about 2 hours of freezing rain with a flash freeze as temps plummeted. The result of it all was that everything had 1""-2"" of ice on pavement/sidewalks under the snow crust. I didn't even try to drive anywhere until today after 2 days of clearing efforts around the house. The roads here are atrocious. Even main routes aren't all down to bare pavement since there is caked ice stuck to the pavement in areas that is really hazardous. Side streets are still mostly all ice since it has been too cold for road salt to do much. Add to that all the snowbanks from previous storms making roads narrow, with many merge lanes on expressways simply not there.

I guess I missed the turn as we found ourselves driving through residential, one lane (due to snow) roads that hadn't been plowed recently. So, probably 6+"" snow, no problem for the XF! Used the rear foglight, oversight on Jag's part, no front fogs... One hour dinner, 2+"" new snow on top of the car! But, light and fluffy.  Woke up Sunday expecting a plethora of fresh powder to ski...and nothing. It didn't snow the entire four days we were there. The wind did howl mightily, though.

3090,"February 11, 2015 12:41AM",benjaminh," As you say, I'm comparing the Audi A3 1.8 with the 2016 Acura TLX 2.4.  Car and Driver seems to put the A3 1.8 0-60 at 7.3, while the 2016 TLX C&D puts at 6.2. One second faster is a pretty significant difference.  When these two models are comparably equipped with leather, heated seats, backup camera, etc. I think the Audi goes for about $33k while the TLX goes for about 3k less. The Audi has more prestige and arguably nicer interior design, but the Acura is quite a bit faster and might even have better handling around corners. At least one test of the A3 1.8 that I saw complained about excessive roll and lean around corners. Plus, I think most would agree that for long term reliability an Acura beats an Audi.  Here's what Auto Week says at the end of it's review:  If you’re looking for an entry-level sports sedan, you’ll definitely want to consider the 2016 ILX now. The new drivetrain has done wonders for Acura’s gateway vehicle, giving it adequate muscle to make a stand against the Audi A3 and Mercedes-Benz CLA. The engine is potent and is definitely a throwback to Honda/Acura 4-cylinders of old that once powered vehicles like the Acura Integra and Honda Prelude.  Handling will also remind you a little of the brand’s sportier performers from the past, which should be music to a Honda/Acura fan’s ears.  http://autoweek.com/article/car-reviews/2016-acura-ilx-drive-review"

Most of my dealings are with the same service adviser at the Honda, VW and Ford dealerships. I go in with a good attitude. If there is a problem with the service work, they know I will come to them personally and not burn them on a survey. I try to be reasonable knowing that they very often have no control over the issue.

3093,"February 11, 2015  2:19AM",markcincinnati,"Assuming my comments are not banned: We have two Audi dealerships in Cincinnati. I have dealt with both of them, but purchased every one of our Audis from one dealership -- now called The Audi Connection.  We have two BMW dealerships, too. Purchased three Bimmers from one of them -- The BMW Store -- over the years.  These two dealerships -- the ones that we have purchased from have been wonderful to deal with from a sales perspective AND a service perspective. Out of more than two dozen Audis we have had, we did have one that was problematic (actually the brakes were the issue). Audi of America sent their area representative to help out the situation. As usual, the dealer was helpful in making such a thing happen.  OK, I get it -- your mileage may differ. I agree with whoever said -- get rid of the bad ones (or words to that effect). No mfgr can tolerate even a very small number of crappy dealers. The Internet spreads the tales of woe like a Cancer. I know dealers are often local business people, not mega corporations -- although this is changing, in the era of the $1B dealership ""groups.""  The dealer can do harm, sometimes great harm to a brand -- and god knows Audi can't afford a sub-par dealer. No mfgr can.  If you need to buy or lease a new Audi and you are within 250 miles of Cincinnati, you can certainly buy one here -- but that probably does you little good with respect to service after the sale. You need a relationship with your dealer somewhat like your relationship with your ""barber"" (or hair dresser if you don't like the term barber). Of course, if you don't work at the relationship too, it won't pan out favorably, probably.  My Audi service mgr and I have been on a first name basis for perhaps 15 years -- our sales rep, in his mid-80's finally retired; he had been at the dealership since the discovery of dirt. Our new guy only has 12+ years with the dealer, he is so new he's still learning where the restroom is.  The time on the job of the various players at the dealership is a huge clue. If the lot tech guy and your sales rep have about the same tenure, you'd be better off finding out the tenure, overall, of the reps. Ditto the shop people, shop foreman, service manager and service writers. My service adviser has been at the dealership for at least a decade.  The Audi Connection is the poster child for what a dealership should look like. The BMW Store has a similar tenure with its people and the dealer experience is all the better for it.  If you have a bad dealer, I do feel for you -- if you can, get the hell away from them."

The new car dealer is happy you bought the car and now happy to service it -  Let's see how the next dealer listens and responds to the trade in on the caddy....

3096,"February 11, 2015 11:35AM",benjaminh," It happens I'm 50, not that you would have known, and so it's not like I need to google that 6-speed Legend. I admired it back in the day.  In some ways perhaps the Germans are ahead of the 2016 ILX. For instance, the A3 seems to have nicer interior design. And the BWM 320i, of course, is sure to have better handling.  But the Audi A3 under the skin has a lot in common with a $20k VW Golf. That doesn't seem different to me than an ILX having some common bones with a $20k Honda Civic. They take these bones, reinforce them, put new skins on them, put new engines in them, etc. Well, I'm not so sure about the engine for the A3, now that I think about it. Isn't that basically the new standard Golf 1.8 turbo engine? Not sure.  A turbo for the ILX might be nice, but I think the ILX 2.4 is already beating all of its competition with the base engines in terms of 0-60. And the competition isn't really weak, and so that seems plenty powerful enough for the likes of me.  And when it comes to reliability and long term ownership, many would take an Acura over an Audi or MB. If you're just leasing and want the prestige, then the others are probably better choices. But if you're actually buying it for yourself and plan on keeping it, then Lexus, Acura, etc., might have an edge there."
3097,"February 11, 2015  3:31PM",graphicguy," Dealership is the front line of your ownership experience. As the old saying goes...""you only get one chance to make a good first impression"".  My wife is a lot more forgiving than I am when it comes to customer service. She's the one who is willing to give the benefit of the doubt. Me? I don't care if it's my real estate agent, my stock broker, my car sales person, or even my landscaper,  Car dealerships (and in turn, car manufacturers) expect me to live up to my commitment when buying a car to pull 10s of thousands of dollars out of my wallet for their product. I expect that they live up to their promise that the car will operate as they said it would. And, if it doesn't, I expect them to make it right without pushback. That last part is where Audi got in trouble.  The dealership Mark is referring to was actually at least moderately helpful, but still unwilling or unable (maybe both) to fix the car. Their Service Manager said the DSG trans and components of the Quattro system needed to be replaced. In a moment of unusual honesty, he said that Audi had a problem with some of the components for the drivetrain that were out of spec. He thought he'd get the green light to do the repair. That authorization never happened. The service manager said at one point that the Regional Audi Rep told him the car was too expensive to fix. Not that it couldn't be fixed, but that he thought it costs too much to fix it. Really? I mean REALLY? Guess what? It was 4X more expensive to buy back and label the car as a corporate buy back.  It wasn't just me with the issues. One of the trade rags I read after they bought mine back, mentioned the same issue. I looked for recalls. Never saw any.  The Audi Customer Service people suggested I take it to the other Audi dealer in town. I have no proof, but I think they looked at it, test drove it, called the Region, got stonwalled and essentially just changed the trans fluid. Clearly, that wasn't the problem as it still existed as I drove it away from their service bay. Took it back to them a 2nd time. Can't remember what they actually did, but it didn't fix the problem.  At that point, Audi had the car for a total of about 6+ weeks. They came back and said lemon law didn't apply because I had the car in for two separate issues. It was the same issue, that needed two fixes....Quattro and DSG. I don't know what they thought....perhaps I was just going to forget about it?  Icing on the cake....called Audi Customer Care (allegedly a Supervisor who had been assigned to my case), who proceeded to tell me the reason none of the local Audi dealerships would service my car, was because I didn't buy it from them. Uhhhhh.....izzatright? That's not what both of the Audi dealers told me. Game on. You're buying the car back, which they ended up doing.  I told Mark's dealer what I thought could have/should have happened. They should have either replaced the trans and Quattro components. Or, they should have just swapped the car for one that worked correctly. Neither was offered....and believe me, I did ask. They wanted me to take a about a $10K hit to swap out the car, though. Yeah....that's really fair!  As far as the Caddy? I'm not expecting the same resale percentage numbers I was used to getting with my Acuras 9which were exemplary). That said, I bought it right ($15K and change dff MSRP). So, I took the good deal up front with getting a great deal instead of on the back end when it comes trade time."
3098,"February 11, 2015  3:46PM",graphicguy,"Mark....I think the Audi Connection could be a very good dealership. I think they were hampered by their Regional Rep. Plus, neither them nor the one on Beechmont could come close to the deal I got out of the Chicago Audi Dealership (Westmont). We're not talking about a deal that was a few hundred better....we're talking about a deal that was a few thousands as the delta (I think it was about $3K difference). I gave both the opportunity to get close...even gave them a little working room given I'd save the time to drive to Chicago and back home again. The Chicago dealer bought me dinner and paid for a hotel room near their dealership. I can't even imagine either Cincinnati dealer doing that.  Went to Dayton Audi store, too. They were more like the old ""let me get my manager to see if we can make a deal"". After waiting 30 minutes for this manager to show up, I left their store. Sales person tried to stall me more, but enough was enough.  BMW Store is good. They never seem to have what I want. They have a pretty rigid set of criteria of cars they order from Stuttgart. They seem to get a lot of base models with base drivetrains. I tend to want the ones with the bigger, better drivetrains, which Sweeney always seems to have. I have a personal relationship with ""my guy"" at Sweeney BMW, though. He's been there for probably 20+ years. I've bought 3 BMWs from him. Deal is always skinny, and simple. Anything I've ever had go wrong, it's taken care of. No questions, no pushback, no fuss, no muss. No issue is too small for them (nor too large).  We're not so different. We deal with people we trust. I think that's true of most people."
3099,"February 11, 2015  4:46PM",roadburner," That's just about the same policy I follow. My SA at my BMW dealer is also a CCA member and attends HPDEs in his 1998 M3. I've also built a relationship with one SA at my Mazda dealer. I've also written letters of praise to the corporate offices; in 1996 I even received a personal reply from Vic Doolan, who at that time was the President of BMWNA. It's amazing to see what happens when you are courteous and don't treat the dealer as an adversary..."
3100,"February 11, 2015  5:01PM",robr2," And as I noted, I don't burn them on surveys. If I have a problem, I speak with them directly. A couple of years ago I had the timing belt done on my Passat. About 30 days later, the thermostat went. It requires just about the same labor time to reach the tstat as to get to the timing belt. I mentioned it to the service manager and he went through my customer history. He noted how much I've spent there, if I was asked if I wanted to change the tstat when they did the timing belt and I'm sure somewhere in there is my CSI report. Viola - 3 hour labor credit."

3102,"February 11, 2015  7:15PM",sweendogy,Finally alive again - nice work men. My anger with Acura (don't get me going on Infiniti) is they were so close and they blew it. They had the turbo and shelved it. They had cool names and ofcourse the reliability.  The ILX is basically a TSX gen one reborn - - which is a good thing but the true comp has them beat. I don't have the numbers but my audi dealer has 60 a3s on the lot and 3 of them are the 1.8. Read caranddriver.com for there take and it's not a good read for the ILX. Weight 63% front should be fun on the twists go.   The dealer experience in reading above posts seems like a big deal- Im about price - how much can I get into and out of a car not which has a latte machine. I would rather not be in a dealer at all- knock on wood I wont be again for anything other than a $300 oil change. bUt I can see @graphic_guy‌ frustration given his unreal experience. I also like the fact he's friends with SweeneyBmw which if I was shopping for a BMW no better place then Sweeney.

Now if the dealer came back with only 7% off MSRP would you have taken the dealer? But in the end, money talks and did for you... I'm sure anyone would have taken the dealers deal of 15K off a 60K car I'm sure you lease payments are lower then what your TL was.

But, breakfast stuff (donuts), little water bottles, a TV, and a small business area if you want a desk or PC.. Good enough for me, since I go there every 6-7 months when the little wrench comes on, and just drive into the express lane (no appointment) and am done in an hour or less. maybe slightly longer if I was do for extra stuff.  so I don't really need a luxury spa, since most of the time I am there I am checking out the new cars (at Acura or one of the other dealers in the complex), and if the car needed to stay longer, I would just get a loaner and not hang around."

3109,"February 12, 2015  2:37PM",graphicguy," Sween....you and I agree (O.M.G..... . Wife being in an Accord, I'm beginning to see the Honda engineering in a lower priced car vs the Acura counterparts. I drove the TLX. Nice car. Not the same driving experience as the TL-S models or even the SH AWD TL that I had. Admittedly, I like the look of the new one better than the old one, but didn't have an issue with the ""beak"" look that others did.  Truth told, if Audi had just fixed my S4, I'd still be in the fold. Instead, they lost me. I have to believe I'm smack dab in the wheelhouse of their demographic, too.  Bang for the buck, an S4 is hard to beat.  But, as these things go, every body is stealing from everyone else. My CTS AWD has the trick torque vectoring rear that the Audi Quattro and Acura TL SH AWD have. My CTS has the twin scroll turbo that the BMW 4 cyl has (and more power to boot). Get the V-Sport (last year could be had for high $40s). and you get the 6 cyl with two turbos...wicked fast.  Took a couple of weeks, but once I got used to CUE, I ""get it"". And, I like it. My understanding is they went through a couple of interim updates to get it to this point, though.  ILX needs that turbo motor. Otherwise, stick with a Civic.  The Civic and Accord are great cars. Are their Acura counterparts worth $X,ooo more? It's not clear cut. So I guess that's pretty telling.  That said, I loved all the Acura I've had. Not sure they shouldn't just go ahead and just be an upscale SUV brand and be done with it. Maybe they're hoping the new NSX will breathe life into their car sales. The ILX and the TLX both need that turbo 4, though. The TLX, in particular, looks like a took a step back going from the sweet 3.7L in the previous gen SH AWD version to the 3.5L in the current car. Not sure what the thought process was there. In the tech dept, where they used to be at the forefront, they're now lagging behind, even with a totally new refresh.  BTW....here's my BMW dealer......http://www.sweeneybmw.com/index.htm   FN....if the prospect of getting $15K+ off a CTS wasn't out there, no way I would have entered the Cadillac showroom. My issues with Cadillac came before the GM ""purge"". I think the Cadillac dealers had to get into shape or the prospect of GM cutting them became quite real. That was very evident in my experiences with the same dealership 11 years ago, and the experience with them now. Truly, it was a night and day difference.  Drove the ATS. Thought it was a really fun car. A tad small for my tastes (reminded me of the A3, sidewise). Drove the CTS, and had as much fun, only with all the trappings of an E Class, A6, 5 Series......a better suspension than any of those, with better steering, braking, etc. A Cadillac....right? Who'd have thunk it.  Frankly, if I didn't get such a good deal on the CTS, I would have been targeting an IS350 F-Sport, probably this summer. That's a fun car, too. A little on the snug side (and I'm not a big guy)."
3110,"February 12, 2015  6:52PM",billyperks4,"Well I am a big guy and this 535 fits me perfectly- this thing is a blast in the snow, the TL AWD is good but the Bimmer is GREAT. - Happy Motoring."
3111,"February 13, 2015  4:12AM",andres3," LOL @ $300 oil changes. I won't be getting my Audi serviced at the dealership again; it's just too much of a rip off. For your $300 they probably do lube things (joints/hinges, ect.) do a 150 pt. inspection, but in the end, it's just an oil change. I got them to give me 15% off because even at 10% off I felt as I was being ripped off (I originally thought 15K service included a new engine air filter at least; it doesn't!). They are making their maintenance intervals a lot longer it seems."
3112,"February 13, 2015  4:20AM",andres3,"At my last HPDE event I won an auction to get more than half off on a Audi S4 3.0 Supercharge tune that takes the S4 to 400+ HP.

They tout that their prices are in line with other national car service places. They say they'll meet or beat any other store on tire prices. And, they're charging $70 for a synthetic oil change, tire rotation and whatever inspections BMW requires.  So, at least they're trying to be competitive.  Even my Caddy dealer offers an oil change, tire rotation and inspection for $40. Won't need that for awhile, though given they're like BMW and offer free service for 4 years."
3115,"February 13, 2015  2:24PM",markcincinnati," I have a question (prompted by an article I read about the RS7): Audi, today, uses the DSG transmission on the S4, S5, S6 and S7, for instance. Yet on the RS7 they use the 8-speed Tiptronic. The stated reason is that the currently available DSG can't take the forces generated by the RS7's engine. The article said the S6 was on the cusp of stressing the DSG -- and owners of an S6 were cautioned not to after-market upgrade the HP and torque (which is quite possible with the turbo S6 V8, e.g.).  Can the DSG in the S4 handle the upgrade you are contemplating and have a good long life? If not, what is the cost -- or risk in this upgrade?  My dealer says the S4 is going to have a horsepower and torque boost to keep it ahead of the standard V6T in the 2016 A6 line. It means, to me, that they have resolved the DSG issue; wonder if there is the headroom in the current DSG to take the upgrade is my concern."
3116,"February 13, 2015  7:53PM",sweendogy,M @all - I have to go tru the dealer recipe and confirm but it was 330 bux all in after taxes - no tire rotation and pretty much an oil change and a car wash which after getting 5 feet of snow the very next week did nothing. Yes I feel ripped off- the all road loner was a nice touch and was able to handle the Wegmans run I had to do. Shame on me. Fool me once.
3117,"February 13, 2015  9:14PM",andres3,I guess they figure a lot of Audi owners are made of money and won't shop around.
3118,"February 13, 2015  9:16PM",andres3," I'm not worried about it. When the DSG oil gets too hot, I know the transmission will go into limp mode, that happened late in my A3's life after I had a bunch of mods on that one. Usually happened when you got near the last lap of a session, but it was annoying nonetheless. Given the R8 has switched and upgraded to a dual clutch DSG unit, I think they've resolved any issues with the DSG and power/torque. I'm not too worried about it. I think they know most RS7 buyers aren't planning to track it, so they made it a slushbox transmission."
3119,"February 13, 2015 11:24PM",sweendogy,@andres3 keep us up on that upgrade- I've been debateing doing something as well after hearing about @flightnurse‌ adding extra to the bmw. Would love to know cost and location. 
3120,"February  4, 2015  1:29PM",brian125,I like the S3. Sharp looking but small. The 19' performance pck/ tires look awesome on this vehicle. Wondering what the mpg's are on the 2.0 turbo???
3121,"February  4, 2015  2:10PM",graphicguy,"Had a chance to drive an S3 while I was in Indianapolis about a week ago. I usually don't do test drives unless I'm at least contemplating a car, which I'm not. But, as visiting my sister and on the way, with some time to kill, I passed an Audi dealer. Pulled in and saw they had 3 S3s. Dealer plate on and away we went.  Fast car. A little small, but it reminded me of the A4 from probably 5 or 6 model years ago. Having owned the S4, the controls were all familiar. If I could only use one word to describe it? HIGHSTRUNG. If feels like it always wants to race. Suspension dances on the line between harsh and firm but never quite crosses over to harsh. You know it's working.....all the time, though. Seat of the pants performance tells me it's about the same as the S4. DSG was fun. Engine gets on the boil right now.  The good news...the quattro system didn't bind like it did with my S4. It operated seamlessly. The bad news is it reminds me of some of the GM cars from the '90s. ""yeah....we can make a suspension that will corner....you'll have to put up with a ride that makes you tired and hurt your butt, but it can be done"". The suspesnion of the S3 just wears you out on anything other than glass smooth roads. The S4 would still be the way I'd go, for the better suspension alone, but the S3 would make me think twice given the price difference.  If I had to go German, and I wanted a fast German sports car, I'd probably save myself a lot of money and go with the Audi's younger sibling.....the VW GTI.  Or, step up the ladder and pay all the money and get a 2/335ix."
3122,"February  4, 2015  3:10PM",kyfdx,Can you get it with a stick?
3123,"February  4, 2015  3:56PM",andres3," You'll have to settle for the Golf R for a stick option. If you ask me, it's a fairly decent bargain since it isn't detuned mechanically. I still think the Audi interior and longer warranty and better customer service is worth at least a few grand, so it's a toss up depending on what you value. From what I've seen, there's better quality control in Ingolstadt than Mexico.  I found the S4 to be stronger ""seat of the pants"" than the S3 though. 7th gear on the DSG is worth it too.  Now, if they could just re-release the S4 being 300 lbs. lighter it would be perfect."
3124,"February  4, 2015  3:59PM",andres3,"I need to ask, what are/were the symptoms of the ""binding"" Quattro AWD system in your S4? How did you notice it? Did it happen every time? occasionally? Did it worsen over time?  Details please.  Maybe that's what made you not get all the BANG you paid for in the S4, because I'm surprised you felt the S3 just as quick (I know the 0-60 times tend to agree with you), but the S4 is underrated, and did you ever use the ""launch control technique"" described in the manual?"
3125,"February  4, 2015  4:08PM",graphicguy,"kyfdx...no stick on the S3 (at least that's what the sales person said). The MSRP on the one I drove, which was fairly loaded up (but you could add even more) was knocking on the $50K door, but you could still add more to it.  You can get a 235ix for that money, which can be had with a manual transmision, handles as well and has a more liveable suspension.  Or, wait a bit and get the ATS-V for what I'll assume will be a simla price and get Magnetic Ride (which is wonderful) and add a healthy dose of style to your performance."

Probably more than a little truth in that statement. Still, the S3 is something other than a refined piece in my estimation. Personally, I'd skip it for $50K and get the S4 for around the same money. Or, the afore mentioned M235i or the ATS-V. Save a bit and get a GTI or R. Either would be more livable and you'd be able to stuff some green back into your pocket.  Ohio winters really aren't that bad, at least not compared to Boston, Chicago or New York. In the southern part of Ohio, we get a couple of dustings most winters. Every 3rd or 4th year, something more ""wintery"" happens, but I can live with that.  I have business colleagues who live in and around San Francisco. I tell them all the time, their winters can be difficult to drive in, too. They don't get any snow, but the Bay Area is wet and cold most of the winter. Not fun to drive in because their traffic is so much worse.  I like AWD installed in FWD platforms because it curbs some of the issues inherent in FWD cars. RWD doesn't have any of that. So, slap on some snow tires in the winter (just in case) and I'd be good to go."

3135,"February 10, 2015 12:50AM",markcincinnati,"The loaded S3 I test drove did indeed seem to just cross into the harsh ride category. The interior at freeway legal speeds seemed to show off its lack of sound deadening, too. A drive from Cincinnati to Cleveland would probably be wearying.  The performance was very impressive -- the thing was super willing to be at full cry seemingly in one second. The handling -- this one had the magnetic suspension option -- was confidence inspiring. The transmission was great -- better than any manual, BUT it was the 6-speed version. The 7-speed seems like it would be a better choice due to the addition of another overdriven gear.  The audio system was very good, not knock your socks off good, but premium ""enough."" That stupid pop up nav screen looks like one of those after market units (from Pioneer) from decades ago. Don't know why Audi chose to do that, when they had the built in look down to a science. But, that is personal preference.  For a change, Porsche now does the integration of the Nav.infotainment system better than Audi. What a world/  At a north of $50K price, the S4 (at least today's S4) seems like a bargain compared to the S3.. Of course a stripped S3 makes a strong performance argument, but, sadly, the premium-ness has been dialed way down. The interior is almost austere -- but perhaps minimalism is the look they were going for.  I would never get a black on black one -- the interior felt like a little teeny weenie cave -- a lighter color would have certainly upped the luxury/premium quotient.  Audi will sell as many of these as they can mint -- I would assume the market for the S3 would have to top out around mid-30;s (age wise). If you can afford an S3, you can afford an S4 and probably even a nicely equipped 3-series (without the i6 engine, however.) You can certainly afford a maxed out A4 SLine -- which wouldn't have the stump pulling torque, but it would have the 8 speed trans a less jittery sport suspension and actually FEEL like a premium car.  I am clearly not the S3 (or A3) target market. Hell, I'm scheming for an S6 -- and hoping for an improved and all new S4 in a year or two from now.  Drive it like YOU live."

3137,"February 10, 2015  2:34AM",benjaminh,"Good reviews so far for the 2016 Acura ILX with the 2.4 DI engine (201 hp) and the 8 speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter. Starting msrp: $28k, undercutting the Audi A3 by $2k while getting to 60 more than a second faster....  From Motor Trend:  ""Acura lost the 2.0-liter engine and dropped in a 2.4-liter, direct injection, 16-valve four-cylinder engine that creates 201 horsepower and 180 lb-ft of torque. It also introduces the first dual-clutch eight-speed automatic transmission with a torque converter and paddle shifters that seem to always know the right gear at the right time. It launches with aggressive power, and once first gear winds out, it quickly shifts and maintains that torque until you let off the gas. There's a touch of torque steer to pull you to the right under heavy acceleration off the line, but that quickly disappears and leaves you with a compact rocket on the road.  The electric power steering is taut and very linear, snapping back to center with ease. Driving around Napa, California's, winding mountain roads, the ILX kept its line through every corner and never let up. It's smooth but feels quick and allowed me a chance to make my driving partner just a little bit carsick after a few twisty corners. Acura also improved the car's braking, allowing it to remain smooth and quick. For those who want the car to do the driving for you, the ILX offers adaptive cruise control and lane-keep assist. I'm not particularly fond of the lane-keep assist system, because it seems to work even when I didn't want it to, pulling me back to the center of the lane during faster driving, but I should have merely turned it off then. On the highway, it does a nice job of smoothly adjusting the car back to the middle of the lane.  Acura added a number of quieting technologies in the car, including active noise cancelation and additional deadening materials. This was quite noticeable. The car is remarkably quiet, especially considering it's built on the Civic platform, which is not the quietest compact around. A quiet ride remains one of the hallmarks of luxury, and the ILX allows for easy conversations at any speed. The interior improvements are just as noticeable as the exterior ones. There are steps up in the quality of materials, the soft dash, and nicely done stitching throughout the cabin. (The A-Spec model includes aluminum floor pedals and special seat inserts.) There are all of the regular luxury items, such as a moonroof, a clean instrument cluster, and comfortable heated seats. When you sit down in this car, you notice that it's nicely done."""
3138,"February 10, 2015  2:35AM",benjaminh,"Another review of the 2016 ILX by Left Lane News:  ""Cruising along the Silverado trail in Napa, California, gave us a quick taste of the ILX's improvements. From the moment we pushed the red starter button, we could see that Acura had corrected many of the motivational issues that plagued the last car. And to their credit, Acura executives acknowledged as much, when during the presentation about the vehicle's new features, they stated that they had taken many an expert's comments to heart.  In addition to the lack of power, one of the bigger complaints of the previous version was the excessive road noise that made its way into the cabin. The NVH guys got it right this time, utilizing tricks and techniques that made a huge difference that was quantifiable in back-to-back tests.  For 2016, buyers will get a taste of just what 51 extra horsepower and an additional 40 lb-ft of torque are capable of, especially in a car that weighs only 3,100 pounds. We found a compact four-door sedan that offered up just the right amount of torque steer when we launched from a standing start. They didn't post exact times but Acura officials state the ILX gets to 60 mph 2.5-seconds faster than the model it replaces. And that was in the normal drive mode. Switching over to sport mode allowed us to put the paddle shift levers to good use as we blipped our way up through the eight-speed gearbox. Offering a different feel then that found in the normal drive mode, it allowed us to hold our gears as long as we wanted while negotiating the twisties in Northern California's wine country."""

By the way, those ""experts"" in the video should know that-on this side of the pond, anyway- a ""Bimmer"" is a BMW car and a ""Beemer"" is a BMW bike..."
3141,"February 10, 2015  4:20AM",stickguy,"Ben, thanks for that. I saw the piece in MT I think. See, this now sounds like the car I should have waited for. Exactly what my wish list it pretty much. I really liked the interior and size. Upping the speed and driving experience is all that it really needed. and if they kept the price the same, it should be a very good deal.  Actually, it sounds more like the original tsx, which it probably is close in size to. and that car I always loved.  Too bad I already got something. But heck, I'll still stop in to take a look when they finally come out. Plan ahead I always say!  I am sure the comparison was to the FWD 1.8 A3. which makes sense, because they are closest in concept and price. Not really comparable to a 40K 2.0t model."
3142,"February 10, 2015  2:03PM",graphicguy,"Read a blurb yesterday stating that Acura is getting ready to bring back turbo 4 cyl motors (which seems to be the price to play in the premium segment). and it's speculated that one will land in the ILX. Wife tried one before settling on the Accord. Tough sell. Small, underpowered, and more expensive than her loaded Accord. Hard to make that fly.  I did like the TLX. But, I didn't like it as well as the TL. So, no go there, too. RLX? Should have saved development money and killed it off. It's barely selling as well as the previous dismal RL. My hope is that there's something Acura is planning (maybe the turbo 4 in the TLX) like a TLX-S because as it stands right now, they're an SUV brand, who happens to throw a few cars in the showroom just in case you need one of those, too.  No secret that Audi just seems to confound their customers...whether it's ""Sween's"" $300 oil change, or them playing ""see no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil"" about the problems my S4 had. Troubling enough it was on the dealer level. Worse, the Audi factory team weren't any better. That attitude eventually catches up to you. You'd think their customer service would be a lot better given how they were almost wiped out of existence in the '80s with the hatchet job they got with unintended acceleration.  S3 will sell. Not sure the age group. It gives a lot of performance. But, those it's targeting are raising families. Is it big enough? For $50K is it really nice enough?? Interior was underwhelming, as Mark pointed out. The materials were not what I'd consider worthy of a $35K car, let alone a $50K car. And, it seems to be a German thing, but who was it that decided a stuck on LCD screen sticking up in the middle of the dash was a ""new trend""? Somebody in their design dept needs a serious remedial course in aesthetics.  Even if a childless couple ends up liking the S3, not sure it's demeanor will appeal given some alternatives who have sharp handling, and a more sophisticated ride. My money? Stuck in an Audi showroom with no other competitor to be found within 1,000 miles? I'd write the check for the S4 for about the same money. Better car, better interior, better suspension, better transmission, better engine....better all the way around.  BMW? Cadillac? VW? Any of those dealers close? I'd be sticking my checkbook back in my pocket and looking at those over the Audi.  Even Mercedes, which has given up its chase to be a sharp performer, puts out a decent product in the $50K range...C Class. Aside from the silly stick up screen (again), it has a nice interior and makes no apologies that it rides nice, while maybe not offering the last 10th in handling or performance.  Buy, the CLA's suspension is every bit as ragged as the Audi's. Interior is....ummm....interesting. Not nearly as nice as the ATS nor an uber conservative 2 or 3 Series. But, it has a star on the front. So, for many, that's all that's needed.  I liked my Audi...when I drove it off the showroom floor. It became troublesome almost immediately. When the dealer stone walls you (and I'm not the only person who's had that happen in these parts), it makes a frustrating situation unbearable. So long Audi.  Had sterling customer service from BMW, and again with my CTS. Need an oil change? New wipers? Got a little parking lot ding? No problem. Leave it with the dealership, who gladly gives you a loaner to use, only to get your car back later all clean and shiny with everything taken care of.....NO CHARGE!  Geez.....that got long winded. I don't have any catchy sign off phrases (wish I did). Ciao!"
3143,"February 10, 2015  3:56PM",henryn,"  The dealership experience makes all of the difference, doesn’t it? When I was younger, I could not understand why anyone would pay the money for a new Cadillac. Then I owned my first Cadillac (not new, but new enough to be under factory warranty). After that, I truly did understand.  I no longer have that kind of money to throw around, but if I did, I would be driving a Cadillac."

3148,"February 10, 2015  9:04PM",ab348,"Dealer experience seems entirely local and hence quite variable. Last night on the news I saw a report of a Mini owner whose car had a bad engine just out of warranty and who had a very bad experience with her dealer and BMW Canada corporate. The local BMW/Mini dealer (not the one in the TV report) had a very bad rep for customer service but has recently been sold to one of the two local dealer groups, the same one I bought my ATS from, who probably will be better. The former owner's rep couldn't be much worse than what it was."
3149,"February 10, 2015  9:29PM",graphicguy,"   Dealerships go a long way to form the perception of any brand. I've been born beat even by Mercedes dealerships, and I've been treated like gold at Chevy dealerships. At the Cadillac, BMW, Mercedes dealerships, you expect better, though. You expect the sales and service reps to listen and respond to what you want or need. Not to resort to arm twisting to get you to buy or become deaf to your communications when talking about issues with your car.  My BMW, Acura, and now my Cadillac dealer can't do enough to listen and respond to what I communicate. My Audi dealer couldn't do too little in response to the same. Guess which dealerships I'll contact first when I decide to get another vehicle? Pretty easy answer."

As for the warranty, well, stressing an engine just a little more and lasting through the warranty period isn't so tough. It is the longevity after the warranty expires that engineers can still concern themselves with. A particular car brand wouldn't sell too well if the majority of them self-destruct at 80k miles, for example. So sell the car with an less-stressed engine and that 99% of buyers who never modify it will demonstrate the car's reliability and reinforce a reputation.

3154,"January 21, 2015  2:21PM",markcincinnati,"Getting a state of tune that increases torque and power and comes as a factory option is:  1. An additional revenue stream 2. Not standard since it probably impacts the durability of the car in question -- but, due to the probable customer who would pay the additional and want the power bump, probably not that much of an issue since the customer MAY be inclined to not keep the car into triple digit (before the 000) miles.  This factory option, then is probably a win for all, in short.  I look at what APR and others have done for the current S4 and even RS7 Audis -- and I'm tempted. But, then, I also know the risk of running naked, without a warranty -- and I think, nah baby nah.  I at least like the concept and notion that my S4 will be both reliable (not too much of a stretch for any car, these days) AND durable (that's the $64,000 or in my case $57,000 question.) The standard state of tune, I'd wager is more likely to have that characteristic.

It changed the sound of the I6 turbo motor, too (for the better). Not sure that last part matters any more, though. Car manufacturers are given to pipe whatever sound they think their engines should make with noise generators through your stereo or with a resonator tapped into the firewall.  Q.....funny, given my car shoice (and the regularity with which I change them), I'm often asked if I trace my cars be neighbors. I don't, at least not any more. It's not that I don't want to. It's that burning up brakes and/or tires every few months, messing with sophosticated suspensions (like the CTS's MRC), etc isn't something I want to do to a $45K, $50K, $60K car....one that I rely on as a daily driver.

I spent just $545 for a new Mazdaspeed intake and $230 for a used Hypertech tuner- which pumped up the motor to 310 hp and 324 lb-ft of torque. A stronger/stiffer rear motor mount from the Focus ST was a whopping $59.97.  The suspension work set me back $1780- but that number includes an adjustable rear anti-roll bar with billet mounts, Koni FSDs with new strut mounts, strut bearings, and bump stops, and a set of OEM take-offs for my summer tires(Michelin Pilot Super Sports which I won for being a Street Survival coach).

3162,"January 22, 2015  9:11PM",andres3," I finally got to track my big heavy S4 and my only complaints don't involve power; there was plenty of that. The problem was weight, high speeds from all that power, and OEM brake pads. I went through 7 or 8 mm of front OEM pad in one weekend, and ruined my front rotors in the process (and blew a rubber gasket on the caliper too). I drove the snot out of the car, and it was fun, but I was left wanting more braking power. Went with the Hawk blue box HPS pads, as I'm told the OEM S4 pads are designed for A4's and their typical drivers, in frozen weather for the NE USA. Not for warm Southern CA tracks. Shame on me for assuming S4's had better brake pads than A4's.  So my brake pads killed my rotors at 15K miles. Lesson learned. Also got better Motul 600 brake fluid."
3163,"January 22, 2015  9:47PM",qbrozen,"I did exactly that setup on my 135i and ate through the pads in one 2-day HPDE. The stock pads, in comparison, lasted me 2 such events and still had life left in them."
3164,"January 23, 2015  6:26AM",andres3,"If I recall, the 135i weight advantage over the 335i is fairly small right? If I would have skipped the last 2 sessions I wonder if my rotors would have been restorable to specs. The tracks are a long drive from San Diego and I track only 2 weekends (max) per year, so I had to abuse the brakes and rotors and risk loss of brake power which can be scary.  One fun thing is I had a full brake fluid reservoir and was able to pull enough G force on some turns that my ""BRAKE"" light indicator would come on briefly. Annoying multiple chimes with it though. Eventually I was able to figure out the G forces were making the fluid move enough that it triggered the low fluid sensor. I added a little bit and that solved the problem for most of the weekend."
3165,"January 23, 2015  3:48PM",qbrozen,"My challenge, and why I tried different fluids and pads, was that the brake pedal would get really spongy after a couple of fast laps. Took me a couple HPDEs, but I finally figured out what the problem was. The TCS on that car had 3 settings. On; 1 push to turn off the TCS but leave on stability control; and hold it for a few secs to turn everything off. The middle setting was supposed to let you have some fun without letting it get out of hand. Well, after new fluid and pads didn't fix it, I realized that every time I would touch the curbing, it was trying to use the active rear diff (which involves braking one rear tire on that car) to ""straighten"" me out. I finally decided to give a session a shot with it fully off. It pulled out of the turns better since it wasn't holding me back anymore, and the pedal no longer went soft. Huge difference."

3170,"January 30, 2015  1:17PM",benjaminh,"Acura's ILX, up until this point, has been almost a joke because of the lackluster 2.0 engine. But the new ILX is going to get standard the direct-injected 2.4 liter with the 8-speed dual clutch transmission with torque converter from the larger TLX. The TLX 2.4 was tested by Motor Trend with a 0-60 time of 7.2. But since the ILX will almost certainly weigh about 500 pounds less, I'm thinking that the new ILX will really be quite a performer for the price. It's expected to start at c. $28k msrp."
3171,"January 30, 2015  3:00PM",graphicguy," Yeah....that's a lot of time to pass. I hear that BMW is revamping all of their drivetrains in that time. Audi's current A/S/4s are getting long in the tooth (although, one could make a case that at least the S4 is still running with the pack).  I'll at least drive the Jag.  After straying from German and Japanes luxury iron back into the American waters with the CTS, I'm absolutely amazed the amount of performance, technology, robust build, high quality, etc that the Folks at Cadillac have been able to come up with.  As I was talking with another enhtusiast that other day, I mentioned this point. I also noted that perhaps it's not so amazing, given GM's debt was wiped off the books, the crustacean period management was shown the door, and listening more to the customers than the accountants would produce. Clean sheet, with all the engineering talent GM has, we're seeing some pretty nice resuts. My best freind has a new Corvette Sting Rey.....MERCY! Porsche who? While a bit small for my tastes, I test drove an ATS. Now THAT is a fun drive.  Ben....I love me some Acuras. And, while improvements to the ILX sound promising, Acura seems to have transformed into a premium SUV company. I liked the TLX I had the opportunity I test drove. But, the hotly contested $45K-$50K market is strewn with gerat cars that offer some pretty potent entres.  Heck, the wife's Accord EX-L is prett darn nice....as a performer, as a tech car, great build, good materials. We looked at the ILX and couldn't make the case for it given the Accord, all loaded up, was cheaper. One could say that the Accord V6 butts heads with the TLX. I became smitten with the SH AWD version of the TL (and that version was world class). But, even there, Acura didn't move the bar forward from the previous version. At the end of the day, I preferred the TL SH AWD to the TLX SH AWD. That's not a good thing when you're trying to sell your new iron."

Oh, I need to correct that: the Audi Connect feature (free for 6 months) was great (when it worked) when I was ""in signal."" The thing is, someone at Audi of America made a deal with ""the fastest"" 3G provider (at the time) T-Mobile. However, at least in SW Ohio the coverage, at best, is poor-to-fair, and overall is 2G to poor. The screen indicator registers 2G about 1/3rd of the time (which renders the feature useless). Now, it is true that when T-Mobile is able to pump out true 3G it can be as good as what sometimes passes for 4G from some carriers.  I had enjoyed using this feature with the voice command to verbally invoke ""Internet Destination, Morton's of Chicago"" or other destinations that would have normally had to have been found via calling 411, getting the number, calling the ""destination"" asking for the address and THEN entering it into the sat nav.  The thing is, the price for this service is $30/month -- which is galling since the TV commercials claim (for SW Ohio) 4, 4G LTE lines (family promo) for $100/mo.  Of course, were I to buy a new A3, Audi Connect no longer uses T-Mobile.  I'd pay $10/month for this crappy (T-Mobile) service -- but $30 for 2G? No way.  The concept and the technology (in the car) make a lot of sense and when things work as expected (even in 3G) the execution is great (within a two block radius of a certain signal location). Swapping out the radio or ""unlocking"" the radio via software or some other method (the sim card?) would make my experience with this vehicle ""the best ever.""  For those folks who want driving performance, I can assure you the S4 (with the 7-speed DSG) is, let me see, effortless to drive, meaning that there is nothing (within reason) the car won't do without breaking a sweat. Another descriptive term: ""carve"" -- driving the car is as effortless as cutting warm butter with a hot knife.  Obviously, I am off-put by one little piece of tech that some folks who live in a strong T-Mobile reception areas probably can't relate to. But in terms of reliability and ""tightness"" this S4 is as new-feeling at 22K miles as it was with 22 miles.  That's the story so far."

A minor imperfection in the roadway unsettling the car and suspension was strike 2, and I just didn't feel the in the pants OOMPH from the butt Dyno I wanted to feel. I may have to start driving used broken-in cars with some miles on them already because I think programming is making some of these new cars feel sluggish on test drives due to perhaps ""built-in"" breaking-in programming?"
3198,"January 16, 2015  9:19PM",andres3," When did GM end the across the board 5 yr./100K miles Power Train Warranty? That was better, though only marginally than the 6 yr./70. I remember they even extended that old 100K warranty to SAAB.  I wasn't frightened at one point of the reliability of my mid-90's Dodge either. I figured by the mid-nineties Americans had figured out how to make a halfway decently reliable car. Didn't stop it from being a lemon though."
3199,"January 16, 2015 10:24PM",markcincinnati,"Reliable and Durable:  I am not a good ambassador of/for the durability of [Audi's in particular] German cars -- since the highest mileage I've ever put on one was just south of 67,000 miles (a 2005 Audi A6 3.2). However, my Audis (and we've had dozens of them) have always been very reliable (excluding our 1978 Audi 5000 which did die young, or at least the battery died young). We never had what I would call a catastrophic failure of the drive train in any of them, period.  Moreover, I suspect our 2011 Infiniti FX35 would have ""run perfectly"" until the wheels turned square and the pistons fell apart -- but we only kept it until it had some 55,000 miles on the OD, so again, who knows -- it, like our Audis was totally reliable. And then:Our 2012 Acura SH-AWD seemed like a budget Audi S4 (a good thing), but it certainly felt both flimsy and tinny (even the doors closed with wimpy thud). And the brakes had about one good stop in them from speed before they faded; and, the rotors almost always felt warped -- even though much of that turned out to be three bent wheels (that Acura paid 50% of the cost of replacement). Three bent wheels? Even if I was abusive while driving, I still find it hard to believe there were 3 bent wheels -- and that the original dealer never thought to road-force balance the wheels to see if THAT was the reason the brakes always appeared to chatter and rumble so.  I have to assume the new ATS and CTS (I did drive the latter) are very fine cars -- my in-laws were Cadillac people, but their experiences were with much older models (pre-2007) and during those [dark] years, their Cadillacs could hardly drive past the dealership without needing to go in to remedy some malady or another.  Cars of all ilks, today, I must assume are very reliable and probably durable, too. I am thinking that based on the way my wife puts miles on her SQ5, we may want to trade it in after about 36-42 months due to the ""depreciation"" hit that happens at about 100,000 miles, not due to any serious ""durability"" or reliability issues.  I can't remember where I read (or heard, perhaps) that virtually all ""modern"" cars will be essentially trouble free (not necessarily low maintenance, though) for a minimum of 150,000 miles. One of the folks I work with has a Bimmer (530) with over 170,000 miles on it and has never had any major repairs, only the maintenance required by the book. He's had dents and dings aplenty (and had them all fixed), but nothing major, ever.  My friend says he puts about $500 in the car two or three times per year -- and everything works pretty much the same as it did when he bought the thing new in 2004.  I'm a fan of the ""factory"" sponsored extended mntce and warranty programs -- and in my case, since my car is leased, I can have the car CPO'd to 100,000 miles for about $1,500 as long as I do so under 50,000 miles and have proof I've maintained the scheduled mntce requirements.  I keep thinking this S4 is so good it will be a keeper -- at least so long as at least one of our cars has the latest and greatest technology. That's the drawback -- as each new gen of these cars comes out they add or update some ""gotta have"" feature or tech (yeah, ""gotta have"" for me, that is). My friend who is part owner of an airplane says he just keeps upgrading his decades old plane with the newest and greatest tech and rebuilds the engine so that despite its age, his plane is actually kept completely up to date. Makes me wish at least some of that approach would trickle down to automobiles.  First thing I'd do is swap out that T-Mobile Internet connection module/radio. Why can't there just be a jack that allows the car to ""sniff"" the Internet from my iPhone. I know, follow the money.  In conclusion, congratulations and kudos to those of you getting new Cadillacs and frankly just about anything new that might qualify today as an ELLPS or LPS car. I wonder, too, at the price point, if the new Genesis is yet a candidate for either ""class"" [of car] -- I've looked at them and they are seriously -- almost Audi A6 -- nice. Yet they're priced like an A4.  Happy New Year."
3200,"January 17, 2015  5:01AM",roadburner,My Club Sport track rat has over 140k on it with no major repairs; ditto for my 148k MS3. My son's X3 has nearly 170k on it with one major repair- but since I haven't had a car payment since 2006 I think I'm still ahead of the game. Still looking for something RWD under $40k that shows even the slightest promise of being entertaining. No joy.
3201,"January 17, 2015  4:05PM",graphicguy,"Mark....well said. I think all manufacturers, but particularly the American marques, have made such great strides in build, reliability, and longevity that is unparrallelled in any time in the industy's history.  It used to be Honda or Toyota were the brands you bought for reliability. Not so sure you can make a significant case for that any more. Aside from Land Rover and Smart, who iare notoriously troublesome, one should expect a long, durable life from all of today's cars.  Technology in cars is moving at break neck speed. You mentioned having your car become a wifi hot spot. Who would have thought of that even 5 short years ago?  In these classes of cars, in addition to great motors and transmissions, suspensions become much more sophosticated. I know in the CTS, I'm amazed at how smooth the suspension is on the interstate, and at the same time can carve up some backroads with equal sophistication.  With the torque vectoring you find in your S4, and what I had in my TL SH AWD, Cadillac has their own version of it, allowing rotation and curve hugging that borders on the unbelievable.  Even the materials in cars of this class are first rate. While both my Audi and TL had pleasant materials, Cadillac is using real wood, real aluminum, real chrome, real suede, controls work like they are bathed in butter or have a tactile feel that really begins to define what the marketers are striving for.....a high end, high quality look ad feel.  Aside from some of the foibles we have had with our cars (mostly along the lines of dealers and/or manufacturers not listening to our complaints), our cars are at the height of car making right now....again, especially in this class."
3202,"January 17, 2015  4:12PM",stickguy,"on the flip side GG, the thought of keeping these modern hi-tech marvels for a long time/lot of miles is scary. My 2000 TL went 175K for me, but that car was a relative ox-cart compared to yours. The only worry I had was the tranny crapping out, and that was still simple even if it would cost around 3K! The rest of the fancy stuff was basic (bun warmers, BOSE radio, normal power options). I changed out the suspension front and rear on sale at Sears for about $600."
3203,"January 17, 2015  7:09PM",qbrozen," Huh. But you were looking at Challengers, right? I'm surprised considering the cars you seem to love are pretty lightweight. You checked out the Toyobaru, right? I would imagine the power is a letdown, though. What else have you tried out? New Stang, perhaps?"
3204,"January 17, 2015  7:25PM",graphicguy," Stick...all good points. I don't think I worry as much about things going awry because it's rare that I keep a car outside the warranty term. I can't imagine what the cost would be to replace something like iDrive, MMI, CUE, etc. Then again, so much of it is software based, maybe they just download firmware.  As it stands, I can control my iPhone through CUE (Siri eyes) now. Is it a big jump to think that the electronics on our cars will be controlled entirely by our smart devices? I have the Magnetic Ride Control on the CTS. Is it far fetched to theink that Cadillac can change the algorithm to how it respoinds via a software download via your phone? How about changing how your steering responds via download, given that most are electronic steering systems today?  Cadillac could change the entier look of CUE and the way it fhnctions with a download. But, you have to have that starting point in order to do that.  Will that make cars more or less reliable as a result? These are all hypotheticals, but it doesn't take too big of a leap of faith to see where this could go."
3205,"January 17, 2015  8:39PM",roadburner," I still like the Challenger R/T and SRT,; big as they are they are pretty quick(well, the SRT is, at least) and just entertaining and involving in a way that most of the other cars I've looked at just aren't. I want to like the BRZ/FR-S but I just can't. Not appreciably quicker than my Club Sport with no other redeeming qualities. The Mustang? I looked at an Ecoboost, but really, a ponycar without a V8 is like the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue without Kathy Ireland(that dates me, I realize). As for the V8, yes, it's fast and handles well, but again, it lacks that ""Gotta Have It!"" vibe I need to keep a sled long term. The Challenger is big and brash and unashamedly retro in an intriguing way- and with the SRT notching up a 1/4 mile time in the high 12 second range along with decent handling and braking, I could enjoy it for some time. If I'm going to have numb steering I want some other facets of the car to entertain me- and the F30 3ers just don't excite me at all- even my lowly MS3 can show a clean pair of heels to a 335i these days..."

3210,"December 27, 2014  8:55PM",markcincinnati," Wow! That's variety. My question is this: would there be a market for 107 variants of the 3-series in the US? And, that question assumes the cost of marketing to ""the market"" would have to include certification for the US. My assumption is that the market for 107 variants of the 3-series just isn't there, for if it were, it would seem to make sense that BMW (of America) would go ahead and import (and bear the cost of certification) the ""in demand"" portion of the range up to 107 variants. Someone, in charge, must have the data to support not doing this -- and by data I mean sales data or market research in support of increased choice.  Of course I said my assumption -- is there any reason to think there IS a [profitable] market for that kind of variety?  While I am at asking [hypothetical] questions, I am wondering why I've never seen an Audi or BMW (or any other brand, perhaps excluding Porsche) with a red leather interior ""in inventory""? -- yet it seems that ""everyone"" says they love red leather interiors. Both my wife and I had to order red leather in our 2014 Audi S cars -- despite the dealer telling us that if they do a dealer trade and end up with a car with red leather that such an outfitted car typically sells more quickly than one with, say, black or gray or brown leather.  I assume the dealer rep was probably patronizing us [regarding red leather] (at least a little bit) but the claim is that white is the single most popular car color and dealer inventories (of Audis and BMWs) do seem to support that notion.  One more question: what does it mean to say something to the effect that such and such a brand of car is ""worn"" (as opposed to driven, I assume)? I read the comment that new BMWs appeal to customers who want to wear their cars -- suggesting to me that the characterization ""worn"" was pejorative (at least as far as the author was concerned)."
3211,"December 27, 2014  9:16PM",roadburner,"As I noted in another topic, in 2007 I wrote an article on the international launch of the E93. I noted that BMW would sell every one they make, even if it had the driving dynamics of a Chevrolet Cobalt. The latest BMWs aren't nearly that bad-yet-but perhaps the tagline ""The Ultimate Fashion Accessory"" would be a more accurate advertising theme."
3212,"December 29, 2014  3:10AM",stickguy,"I actually thought that the 320i, when it was introduced, was what purists were looking for. Simpler, marginally lighter, cheaper. More of the spiritual descendant to the early 2002 and 3 series cars than a massively powered 335. The volume model in the later 90s/early 2000s was likely the 323/325, right?  so if anything, the 320 really is the entry level BMW to allow people that want one to get into ""the family"", same as the 323/325 did previously. it drives like a BMW, looks and feels like one, etc. So if anything, the purist's problem shouldn't be with the 320, it is the whole series."
3213,"December 29, 2014  3:14AM",roadburner," I'd consider a 320i if the steering was decent- I just can't accept a setup that is so devoid of feel- in a BMW, at any rate."
3214,"December 30, 2014  4:29PM",graphicguy,"Sorry FN....just saw your question. Spent last week visiting wife's brother in San Francisco.  I got the CTS AWD Performance version. The Magnetic Ride suspension is the real deal. Allegedly, the MRC is capable of infinitely changing the shock settings something like a 1,000 times a second, depending on road conditions. It has its own version of torque vectoring. These ""trick"" torque vectoring schemes really do improve the handling of these cars (as with the Audi S and TL SH AWD).  It smooths out the roughest roads, yet stays sharp when cornering and rotating. Like most cars in this class, the adjustable suspension is available. I keep it in ""Sport"", which firms the steering response (best version of electronic steering I've used) and changes shift patterns. Feels much like a RWD based Audi Quattro or TL SH AWD.  Put it in ""touring"" mode, and it feels much like a 4matic E class or an A6 Quattro.  Sport mode, while ""firm"" really doesn't describe the ride accurately,  Great seats, while not the sport seats in the TL SH AWD (which I loved), but certainly more ""sporty"" and comfortable than the hard, flat Mercedes seats. and not nearly as ""hard"" as the S4's.  Not as speedy as an Audi S4, but quite torquey. Probably 0-60 in the 5 1/2 to 6 second range.....works for me. Probably more torque in the lower rev ranges than the TL....especially around town. It gets up and scoots to extra legal speeds in short order on the highway.  All the gee gaws. It took a few days to get used to CUE. But, now that I am, all the controls for it fall immediately to had once the proximity sensor senses your hand near the screen. Touch controls work. Instead of sliding the ""metal bars"", you realize those bars are only there to guide your fingers. You slide just above the metal bars.  All the chrome, wood, aluminum, suede, leather, etc is all real. Build and materials are all exemplary and as good, or better than anything in the class.  For reasons that befuddle me (and probably Cadillac, considering the accolades the car has received), the discounts were substantial on the CTS. I got into one for about the price of a middle of the road A4, TL, 3 series.....a screaming bargain, that according to their management, will be the last time those deals will be available for the same car.  Yes, it's new. Yes, I'm enamored with it. Pretty darn happy with a car that's made in Detroit that's able to match, and in some important ways, excel over the E, A6, etc out there."
3215,"December 30, 2014  5:23PM",billyperks4,Graph- Can I ask? Why did you get rid of your TL?
3216,"December 30, 2014  5:26PM",graphicguy," RB...you're a track guy. I admire you as your interest in track work isn't just superficial (vs some people I know who trick out their autox cars and like their car's decals more than their cars).  I did some autox years ago (in a Toyota Corolla 16V), but I was mostly a 1/4 mile, dragstrip guy....had my own rat rod for that very purpose.  Some people (including myself) just want a good handling car that can get out of its own way and offers some creature comforts.  The majority want a 3 pointed star, or a roundel. Their car hunt begins and ends there.  stick....I view the 320i to be a spiritual successor to the 2002. Having been in one of the original 2002s (not mine, but a college friend's), they broke the mold. BMW has built on that success. They are where they are today as a result of the 2002's initial success."

Long and short of it, through a friend of a friend, I met the owner (and his son) of a Caddy dealer that my late Mother did business with. I had relayed the terrible experience my late Mother had with the dealership about 10 years ago (one that I had to get involved with to work it out). He explained that the entire staff had turned over since then, and that he was not aware of my Mother's issues. He invited me to just come in and meet his son, who had just been named the GM of the dealership and to see how they had totally refurbished the physical building.  I'm a car guy. I was curious. Went there. Got a tour of the newly remodelled dealership. Was invited to take a car home over the weekend. Really was enamored with the way the CTS drove and how well it was built. I essentially got a $60K car less $15K+ and, over two years of ownership, I only lost $6K on the TL. Thought it was a good deal.  Rest is history."
3220,"December 31, 2014  2:04AM",sweendogy,@graphicguy - can you go over those numbers again with this trade - / hard to believe you got 15k off a new car and then at the same time were able to trade the TL in for 6k less then paid after 2 years- (did you also get 6k off when buying the TL originally? I have done a few car deals in my day but this tops the cake.
3221,"December 31, 2014  2:32AM",graphicguy,"Sween...paid $38 and change for the TL. Caddy dealer gave $32. Figure he'll ask 34, sell for 33.  CTS is a '14....C&D Top 10. Caddy can't sell them. Don't know why. It's as nice of a car as I've ever driven. Caddy slapped a $6K rebate on them. I figure there's another $5K in hidden trunk money.

3222,"December 31, 2014 11:29AM",circlew,"CTS is a '14....C&D Top 10. Caddy can't sell them. Don't know why. And to be fair, the new CTS is priced right in line with the cars that GM sees as its key competitors: the Mercedes-Benz E Class, the BMW 5-Series, and Audi's A6.  But Cadillac's customers aren't used to paying those kinds of prices, and some are shopping elsewhere. Meanwhile, BMW and Mercedes buyers aren't (yet) flocking to Cadillac's showrooms to make up the difference.  In other words, Cadillac is losing its old customers -- but isn't yet winning enough new ones to make up the difference. So, why isn't Cadillac trimming its prices?  Not long ago, a price cut would have been GM's response. But these days, Cadillac is under new management -- and its new president, longtime Audi executive Johan de Nysschen, ordered something different: a big cut in production at the factory that makes the two sedans."
3223,"December 31, 2014  4:15PM",graphicguy,"circle....good points. I think Cadillac is going through a transition. Not sure if people are used to paying prices similar to Benz or Audi or BMW. My dealer says he sells every $85K Escalade he can get his hands on....at MSRP plus. Cadillac split their lux sport sedan series in two. What used to be the CTS doing battle against the 3 and 5 series, the C and E class, the Audi A4 and A6, is now the duty of the ATS against the 3, C and A4, with the CTS doing battle against the 5, E, and A6.  CTS moved up the ladder, with the ATS going against the cars we talk about in here.  Their President even admitted this isn't going to happen over night, but will probably take a couple of years.  Cadillac is in a unique situation where they don't seem to care about their ""traditional"" customer. I don't know if they ever would have snagged me unless the CTS were such a very good car to begin with.  You'll have the customer who bought a previous gen of the CTS and walk into the showroom thinking ""no way I'll spend $7K more for the new one over the old one."" Cadillac points them in the direction of the ATS and says....here's a better car than your previous CTS and it costs less. Some will get that. Some won't.  However, if you want an even better car than the ATS, here's the CTS.  Again, it will take some time. And, some won't even like the way the new ATS or CTS drive, given they are more on the sports end of the luxury sports sedan/coupe market.  But, once they take hold, I think they have a very good foundation to build on to compete, and excel in both spaces.  They seem determined to do what it takes to get there. Good cars. Drive an ATS or CTS if you get a chance. They are very good sport luxury cars....almost getting to the point where tehy are filling the voids that Mercedes and BMW have abandoned."

I'm one of the few who actually liked the TL's styling. But, I realize I was in the minority. Good cars, especially for the money.  CTS is a different level of car. The CTS' turbo 2.0L performs better than the TL with the 3.7L 6 cylinder. 50-50 weight distribution which makes for great CTS handling.  In short, it looks better, handles better, performs better, is build better with better materials than my TL. That said, the CTS costs thousands more, too. So, it better be that much better than the TL.  In the honeymoon phase with it. If it stays out of the dealership service dept, I'll be a happy camper."

3258,"December 26, 2014  7:07PM",flightnurse," The maintenance plan has changed, with the current plan you only get ONE free service a year, or unless the on board computer says differently. BMW uses synthetic oil and allows BMW to get away with the longer service intervals. The real start of the maintenance plan is the 4yr-50K bumper to bumper warranty., So if you drive aggressively you can go through a set of brakes in the 50K and save yourself about $1200...  When I driving between Phoenix and San Diego the beginning of the year (weekly) I racked up a lot of miles, but the service indicator in the car kept the same date for when the car will need service, but in June I brought the car into the dealer to get the oil changed since I had 13K miles on the car, cost, $110... An expensive lesson... But back in Oct I took the 320 in for it's first free service, they did everything and changed the oil, for free... My service indicator says my next service is due in 1400 miles on 4-15-2015, I currently have 21500 miles on it. So not too sure what to make of the service indicator.. The maintenance plan is nice, but I think BMW needs to shorten the intervals in which they give the free service.  BTW GC, which version of the CTS did you get? Luxury, Performance or Premium?"

If BMW would go back and build just niche cars they wouldn't be making any money, because people like you Road don't buy enough cars to keep BMW open. Yes, todays 3 series, 5 series are bigger cars, just like the Mazda 6, Camry, A4, and C class are bigger then their last generation.  So does my F30 have the road feel that my E46 330 had NO, so is the F30 a horrible car no. It does what I want it to do, the standard suspension is much firmer then say the Nissan Altima, Camry, Accord and a dozen of other cars and it still drives like a German car. The road feel isn't an issue for me, and why, simple, I don't drive like an A55 all over town, when driven normal I don't have a problem with it. I wanted a M235, until I drove one for 3 days and saw that it is just too small for me, I have grown to like the bigger size of the F30.

3264,"December 27, 2014  6:07AM",markcincinnati," ~ BMW has not done much, if anything, because it ""needs"" to make money. It is a for profit company it does everything it does because it must make money -- fine point between needs and must, I know, but I think it is a given that all of these automobile companies are for profit. They were when they made the versions of cars that ""used to be"" so much better -- if they actually were better then than they are now.  The perspective that I hold currently is that BMW is actually making cars they have evidence their customers want. They have ""proof"" that their new cars are an improvement over their previous models and their customers affirm that proof. If the customers don't affirm, they make changes to the cars until the cars ""succeed.""  A key reason for the almost total abandonment of the manual transmission, for example, (by BMW, to name just one) is the customers (BMW is seeking) perceive them to be less desirable than the automatic shifting transmissions available.  Said another way, automatic transmissions are superior to manual transmissions -- according to the market BMW caters to and wants (and needs and must) to sell to. That is an empirical fact -- it is not an opinion (based on the results that can be measured). If you -- the rhetorical you -- believe a manual transmission is superior, that is your opinion. The facts do not support the opinion, or if so, only slightly. Now one may prefer a manual transmission (again this is but one example) over a manual transmission, but that -- from the perspective that BMW values -- is an outlier, an anomaly, virtually irrelevant.  I believe I have suggested previously, that ""we"" killed manual transmissions -- we killed them by not buying them, not because they weren't or aren't offered; they're not offered because we didn't buy them.  Likewise, 4 and 6 cylinder engines (as another example) replaced 8 cylinder engines because ""we"" deemed them superior -- and proved thus by buying cars with 6's and 4's. The market proved that there really was a substitute for displacement -- and that was volume-metric efficiency.  I do not believe that ALL new BMW's or Mercedes or Audis or whatever brand you favor are superior to their ""ancestors"", but the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of them are.  I applaud anyone's affection for nostalgia -- I am often sentimental; the older I get the more I represent that remark, in fact. But nostalgia often -- some would say always -- represents a filtered view of the past. BMW (et al) would almost certainly fail if it attempted to build its new cars to emulate its previous generations, no matter how highly acclaimed or ""remembered"" they may be.  Auto transmissions, forced induction smaller displacement engines, softer riding suspensions and more and more reliance upon ""technology"" are good things, superior things, actual improvements over previous generation's offerings and capabilities.  You may not, for whatever reason, agree -- but the market, fundamentally, says you're wrong.  Now, being somewhat (sometimes) of a fellow Luddite, I did (and sometimes still do) mourn the virtual and soon to be total death of the manual transmission. However, now that I have 20,000 miles worth of experience with an Audi 7-speed DSG connected to a super-charged 6, I must finally admit Eli Whitney had a pretty good idea after all.  Dammit!"
3265,"December 27, 2014  3:35PM",roadburner,"I don't think the enthusiasts are actually clamoring for simply a remanufactured 2002; what they want is a car that continues to embody the traditional BMW virtues- a nimble car that communicates what it is doing to the driver. Cadillac and Lexus are actually moving into that automotive niche while BMW abandons it. Pandering to the status-conscious ""wearers"" who want a featherbed ride and minimum involvement in the driving process may generate short-term gains, but those folks will move on to the next shiny ""in"" bauble in a heartbeat."
3266,"December 27, 2014  4:04PM",cdnpinhead,"The emphasis on electronic gadgetry and increasingly complex solutions to fairly simple problems (8-speed automatic transmission, anyone) is what leads so many people to dread running these ""new and improved"" cars bare (past their warranties).  I fail to see why EPA/CARB-driven cars are superior to the incredible variety of vehicles that are available in Europe and elsewhere in the world. Certifying a drive train is so bloody expensive in the U.S. that any given manufacturer limits what's sold here to a bare minimum. If BMW sold any of the small diesel wagons (with a manual) that have been available for decades elsewhere here in the U.S. I'd already be driving one.  Oh, and if anyone thinks run-flat tires, another solution looking for a problem, make any sense out here in the West, I'd be interested in their reasoning. Driving hundreds of miles with only rudimentary services available, particularly on the weekends and/or at night, without a spare tire of any kind, is asking for a three-day delay while the necessary $300 tire is shipped to within 50 miles of where you had a simple flat tire. Then there's the question of whether the tire machine at Ed's Gas, Bait and Whorehouse in Austin, NV, will be able to get it installed without totally wrecking the new tire, the wheel, or both.  It's clear that the majority, as dictated to by various governments, have given us the selection of vehicles that are available. I choose not to participate, and I don't think I'm alone. The majority on here seem to think it's wonderful. Party on."
3267,"December 27, 2014  4:18PM",cdnpinhead, I'm not.
3268,"December 27, 2014  4:57PM",markcincinnati,"The cars that are sold here in the US at least are here because of the customers, not the government. The governmental rules and regulations do not single out BMW or Cadillac or Fiat. The playing field, so to speak, is level. How a company responds to these regulations is what differentiates it.  Overwhelmingly, the reason the cars from BMW are they way they are is because these cars sell -- if manual transmission diesel Bimmers, etc, were selling, they'd be brought into the US (assuming they are actually manufactured).  In the universe that I am familiar with, I know that Audi of America responded to a LOUD, but very very tiny campaign (that I participated in) to reintroduce the manual transmission to the A6. Audi went ahead and made the A6 manual trans version available to US customers. The cars sat on the lots of understandably pissed dealers who bought the cars for inventory only to have them sit and sit and sit for months and months.  I did go ahead and order the ""last"" manual transmission (think of the song the ""Last DJ"") Audi of size in 2003. It was an allroad and I had to special order it because the dealership general manager told me he had been burned by millions tied up in floorplanning manual trans A6's to an unmoved and ""I'll take my business elsewhere"" market.  The last BMW I drove was a 2014 5 series with a bunch of options including X-drive and all of the stuff BMW deems fit to call ""sport"" or at least sport-like. The car was quick, fast, quiet, comfortable and for its size cornered like a snake in a rat hole (credit my wife for the phrase).  One of the folks I work with has a 2005 BMW 5 series -- there is no comparison, the 2014 is the more desirable car.  The car is what it is due to the votes cast by the market. We may, or some of us may, deride the newer cars as mere shadows of their ancestors, posers even; but, again, from the perspective of the engineers, marketers, sales people, etc associated with BMW, the new cars are improvements, advancements of the ""breed"" (or brand, at least).  Yeah, I know, I'm preaching to the:  Use it Use it up Wear it out Do without. . .  crowd.  But, whatever one likes is certainly one's prerogative. I'll defend that too."
3269,"December 27, 2014  5:33PM",cdnpinhead,"BMW UK lists 46 variants of the 3-series with gasoline engines and a further 61 in diesel. They don't all represent different drivelines, but at least half do, with different engine size, transmission and AWD options that would each have to be certified separately by the EPA at what I'm told is huge expense. This in a country that is right-hand drive, while the majority of BMW production goes the other way, so don't tell me about economy of scale.  I wouldn't mind ordering the car just the way I wanted it, if I could, but only a handful of the variants are available over here, and none are the ones I'm interested in. I think they've finally got oil level indicators that work, unlike the those that were first introduced to replace the stone-simple dipstick . Apparently one of the reasons was the oil vapor that escaped from the open dipstick tube(?!). Well beyond the point of diminishing returns I would think.  I could change out the solid-rubber-feeling run-flats but there's no point with the vehicle choice that's available here."

3278,"December 19, 2014  9:04PM",ab348, I feel the same. I almost think of them as the Lincoln of Asian cars.
3279,"December 19, 2014  9:10PM",markcincinnati," Well, here are some thoughts on Infiniti -- from a former owner of an Infiniti product and also, at the same time, an Acura product.  The auto manufacturers in the past decades have wanted to ""rationalize"" their product names. They have wanted to do so for essentially a singular purpose: marketing (leading to increased market share, mind share, sales, etc.)  Infiniti decided that Q was the answer as a prefix and that the following numbers/letter combination would signify the size or perhaps even class of the vehicle. I would assume if money were no object they would have liked to have rolled out a completely new -- across the board -- product family. They had to settle for one new car, the Q50. The M37 became the Q70 as you identified.  It is true that most of us here on Edmunds know the Q70 is the former M37. I would posit that most people, however, won't have a clue that the Q70 is a renamed product.  The M37 and the Q70 are still very competent LPS offerings, even though the Q70 does need to be updated, refreshed or replaced with a newer version. To me, Infinitis have often been [note the tense] the most German-like of the Japanese (and Korean) offerings. The recent ""transfer"" of their President, Johan De Nysschen, (then late of Audi) to go to Cadillac probably is a negative for Infiniti -- but, well, there you have it -- since I would have assumed Johan would have made good use of his 19-year Audi stint to imbue Infiniti with even more German-ness.  Right now, it seems to me that Infiniti and Acura, both, appear to be somewhat rudderless if their recent products are any indication of what is going on ""at the top."" The TLX could've have been the vehicle for Acura to announce ""we're not Honda anymore,"" but I think they missed the target completely if you axed me.  Meantime, Lexus has inched its way even further from Toyota and the Koreans are the ones the Germans are probably seeing in their rear-view mirrors more so than anything out of Japan (with the possible exception of the IS350F-sport).  Again, if you axed me, the saving grace for the Germans is the brand name ""KIA"" -- at least if you live here in River City where removing all the KIA badges seems the norm. If KIA somehow figures out a new name (think GoldStar becoming LG) for their brand, I would think the Germans might have more to worry about.  Today, the Germans seem to be the aspirational cars -- but, as the poet Frost once said, ""nothing gold can stay."" I did enjoy my time with my 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance, but -- money not a factor -- my 2014 S4 is an entirely different experience (despite my belief that the TL was about as close to an S4 as one could get for about $47K.)  Merry Christmas all."
3280,"December 19, 2014 10:23PM",graphicguy," Mark...as always, I like reading your posts. And, can't disagree. I also just realized that LG has a TOTALLY different connotation than the old GoldStar brand, even though they're the same company.  Best to you and yours!"

Sure its a responce (or a car in the 320) but is it worthy. As others have mentioned the CPO finance rates are very close to new car rates. If you can get a Cpo that fits your criteria why would you not want to save first year depresh- even if it's not cpo you can still get a better (than cpo) deal with the balance of a luxury car makers warrantee and get a better car then you would if new.

3283,"December 20, 2014 12:11PM",circlew,"Is the Genesis 5.0 worthy of ELLP, or at least ELL sedan? Power from that 5.0-liter V-8 is down from the 2014 model's 429 hp at 6400 rpm to 420 hp at 6000 rpm, but torque is up. The Genesis V-8 now produces 383 lb-ft at 5000 rpm, up from the 2014 model's 376 lb-ft at 5000 rpm. The Genesis V-8 is happy to sip regular fuel instead of premium, but then it only makes 407 hp and 372 lb-ft. The new Genesis is a more substantial car, and the weight has a predictable effect at the track. Acceleration from 0 to 60 mph comes in 5.2 seconds, up from that last-gen Genesis' 4.8-second time. That makes the 2015 Genesis V-8 a midpack performer, depending on what you think its competitors are. Smaller, pricier V-8-powered competitors such as the Mercedes-Benz E550 and Infiniti Q70 5.6 will smoke the Genesis V-8. Among price-competitive offerings, an all-wheel-drive 2012 Audi A6 with a supercharged V-6 engine sprinted from 0-60 mph in 4.7 seconds, while a 2012 BMW 535i checked in at 5.5 seconds, an all-wheel-drive 2014 Mercedes-Benz E350 at 5.8 seconds, and a 2013 Lexus GS 350 F Sport with a six-speed automatic at 5.4 seconds. Passing power from 45-65 mph is ample in the Genesis V-8, with a 2.6-second time not appreciably different from that of the last-gen Genesis V-8 (2.4 seconds), A6 3.0T (2.5 seconds), and 2013 GS 350 F Sport (2.6 seconds), but quicker than the 535i's 2.9 seconds and the 2014 CTS 3.6's 3.1 seconds."

I'm very impressed with ride, quality of this vehicle. Nothing but high praise. Handling is not in the Audi or BMW category but that's not why I bought this vehicle. The Genesis is very big inside , ultra quiet on the road , One of the best sounding radio systems ( lexicon ) 17 speakers in any car I heard. Plenty of giddy up when you want to live life fast @429 h/p A good bang for your buck. CR reports / C&D and most reviewers have put the new 2015 model at the top of the pack . A real good buy for your money if you could get past the brand.  I test drove the 2015 Genesis v-6.. This luxury sedan @48k is a great choice that offers amenities that European vehicles are selling 15, to 20k more. The Upgraded suspension modes , Handling, Refinement is well noted on this 2015 model . Add Hyundai's 5/60....100k powertrain warranty makes this vehicle quite appealing .

Our Pilot is about a year & a half away from being paid off. I know my wife drives it because we have 3 kids and need a big, family, truckster. We could keep the Pilot around for kid hauling, car pooling, & vacation duty and pick up a CPO ELLPS for her to drive.

3314,"December 17, 2014  7:24PM",andys120,There are so many complex systems in today's Luxury and near-lux cars that it might be worthwhile to offer how-to seminars. A buddy of mine bought a new E350 and clearly hadn't had the time to learn most of the systems.  I told him if he'd lend me the car for a couple of days I'd learn the features and give him a quickie lesson. He didn't go for it.
3315,"December 17, 2014  7:51PM",ivan_99,"I don't think I'd do a CPO again.  I had an 06 IS350. When I purchased it it was 2 years old...but quickly turned 3 a few months later.  Even though I had the CPO warranty I had a few items that fell outside of that coverage (which was annoying).  The biggest problem I had was after year 3 of the payments I was (still) making payments for a 5-6 year old car. So when you're nearing 5 years of payments you're paying for an 8-9 year old car. I knew all this going in...but didn't think I'd have an issue making payments on an ""old"" car. It held up fairly well, but there were still wear and tear issues that revealed themselves when it was 6 years old (tiny chunks of the dash crumbling off, suspension creaks, few rattles, etc.).  To make matters worse, you're paying a premium for the CPO; mine was at least $2k over a comparable model (and mileage). So if you're attempting to sell early you're at a disadvantage.  Plus...when I traded it in (at another dealer) it was revealed that at some point before I purchased it there was a claim for hail damage; so this reduced it's trade in value. My fault here...I assumed CPO vehicles never had been in accidents/claims, etc; doesn't cost much to do a quick search...  For me, I think I would have been better off just purchasing a used vehicle...or a new vehicle in a ""lower"" class since I like ""new""."
3316,"December 17, 2014  8:44PM",billyperks4,"No lower class for me- always looking to upgrade. I am not advocating for CPO-just for me, its the prudent thing to do. The 535 I have now was listed for 65K in 2011- no way I am going to lay that kind of money out."

Buying a CPO can be a smart choice for some, just like buying new is a smart choice for others. Rick at one time was looking at a Lexus LS460 but the original sticker was over the top, even though the car residual for very high, the payments were higher then what he was willing to pay, so he was looking at a CPO LS 460. But he came to his senses and moved on... BTW, leases residuals for Lexus's are out of this world, RX is 67%, LS 66%.."

3319,"December 18, 2014  2:47AM",nyccarguy, You and I are in the same boat. I don't want to be making payments on a car that's more than 5 years old plus pay for maintenance & out of warranty repairs.
3320,"December 18, 2014  3:00AM",sweendogy,The payments someone would make on a cpo would be a lot less then a new car. Yes the car would be older but the payments would significantly less and the ability to buy a better car (all in) with less cash. The financing rates of used are as good as new - so that's not the issue- if you are paying for a cpo 5 years after delivery you should not be buying a Cpo- you should not be buying a new car- you should lease or maybe downgrade expectations on what you can afford.
3321,"December 18, 2014  3:30AM",stickguy,"I agree with Sween. And NYC. NYC in that I don't want to pay on a car more than 4-5 YO. And sween that if you are, you spent too much on the CPO.  I look at a CPO this way. If I am willing to go 5 years payments on a new car, I will go 3 on a 2 YO CPO. Payments end at the same age. So the only way it makes sense is if the price is lower enough to make it worthwhile, since I am giving up two years use on the car (and the best 2!)  Plus you have to keep a car older than 5 years, otherwise you are always making payments. Though overall the payments should be lower (since the car is cheaper) but that can actually cancel out if you trade every 3 years."

3325,"December 18, 2014  3:30PM",dino001," To be blunt, you simply bought a car you couldn't afford and the five-year loan simply masked that fact. Having to take a 5-year loan on nearly 3-year old car is basically an equivalent of taking a 7-year or longer loan on a new car and nobody with their right senses would do that. It's a false choice between a new non-luxury or used luxury brand for those who have to borrow money for long term to buy it. That choice only works financially when one can pay cash or takes a two or three year loan."

3332,"December  9, 2014 10:23PM",markcincinnati," You may know that my wife and I, after decades of German only, went with an Infiniti and an Acura (2011 and 2012 respectively). She kept her 39 month lease vehicle 35 months and I kept my 36 month lease TL SH- AWD Advance 25 months.  These cars, hers an FX and mine a TL were stickered at a combined $97K. The leases had to have been subvented by the mfgrs and the cars were reliable (and I assume durable) and well made with several obvious (and successful) attempts to move them upscale from their Nissan and Honda lineage. Perhaps for the right money -- and it would have to be seriously inexpensive -- a new TL, Q or IS (I actually ordered the Lexus IS-350AWD F-Sport) might have made it into our garage.  Since we test drive cars almost as a hobby, we were really -- this time -- able to see how far the Germans had come since our last German cars, hers a 2008 BMW, mine a 2009 Audi. The differences, now, at this point of inflection are, once again in favor of the Germans.  My wife puts it this way, ""The Japanese cars are 'competent' appliances -- but they ain't got no soul."" This from a person with one undergrad and two graduate level degrees (one of them a JD) who hates it when improper grammar is used.  The hell of it is, her description is perfect -- in tone, tenor and accuracy. The Germans, today at least, have indeed again found that certain something that can best be described as soul. And, the money (when leased) is no longer an excuse to 'settle' for the more or less soul-less vehicles currently marketed by the big-3 Japanese ELLPS and LPS providers.  Frankly, even the new Volvo products bear a good long look.  Our guess is the Japanese premium cars may offer higher durability scores, but even that seems not to be the case as my wife's SQ5 Prestige now is approaching 30K miles and still feels new. We'll see if this new car smell (so to speak) remains at 50K, but things look good."
3333,"December 10, 2014  4:51AM",flightnurse,"Mark, we are looking at a SUV for Rick, and at the Phoenix Auto Show 2 weeks ago, it was nice to have all the SUV's in one room so to speak to take a look at them all. So far the BMW X3 and Audi Q5 are the two top contenders. At the Auto Show we looked at the MB GLA, GLK, and ML. The GL is just too big (this is Ricks words, not mine.) the GLA I was impressed with, but too small, the GLK was too small, the ML I found to be just right. What I found interesting with the ML was, the faux leather in it looked and felt real, and the contrasting stitching made the interior look more upper class. We test drove a ML250 with the new 2.1l diesel engine, I was not impressed at all with the engine, lots of turbo lag and the engine did not feel refined like the Audi or BMW. But the size was just right, slightly bigger then the Audi and BMW, but smaller then the X5 and Q7.  At the Auto show we looked at the Infiniti QX60 and was surprised on how there isn't much of a difference between the dash of the QX60 and Pathfinder, lots of Nissan switch gear in it, for almost 20K price difference between the two Nissan needs to not use parts bin parts (nissan) in the infiniti."
3334,"December 10, 2014  5:11PM",graphicguy,"Mark....I think overall, the quality and competence of today's cars are so far removed (better) from where they were even 5 short years ago is a pretty big gulf.  I look at my former TL SH AWD and remember what the first one I drove of the current gen was like. Not sure what Acura did, but it was clear they had tweaked the suspension, updated to electronics, and numerous and sundry other things in the ensuing years up until the TLX came out. Most of what they did, you couldn't see. You could sure feel it in the way the car handled, the way it rode, the way it steered, the way the electronics responded, etc.  I have a CTS now. It iOS light years ahead of anything I've looked at recently....from the way it drives, the way it handles, the way it rides, the quality of materials, the careful assembly, the paint with lustrous, no orange peel effect, etc.  Over in the sales/purchase threads, there are lots of discussions about how much Mercedes has changed over the last 5 years. I know for a fact that the E92 BMW I had has been changed immeasurably (some say improved, some say not) vs the F3x versions.  Given your experience with the S4 vs my experience with the S4, it sounds like Audi quietly addressed their (what I considered major) issues.  The march of technology and performance in cars over the last few years is nothing short of breathtaking."
3335,"December 11, 2014  5:38AM",nyccarguy,"A car we often don't speak of in here is the Lexus IS. We all know the volume selling IS 250 AWD's acceleration numbers are lackluster and the IS 350's high 5s 0-60 times won't win you too many bragging rights on the Internet. The IS 350 F-Sport version has some positives going for it.  Power train - the 3.5L V6 has remained essentially unchanged since 2006 as has the 6-Speed Automatic still found in the AWD version. The RWD has an 8-Speed automatic (maybe it can't handle the AWD?). It is old school for sure, especially compared to the other 4cyl turbos in the class, but tried & true none the less.  Body - yes you can call the IS polarizing. It's grille even looks like The Predator. It's looks are very modern. The car does stand out in a crowd of ubiquitous 320s, 328s, C300s, & Audi A4s. I like the charcoal, split 5 Spoke wheels.  Adaptive Suspension - many of today's ELLPS are too soft in their base form and too harsh with their sport suspensions. The IS350 F Sport has an adaptive suspension that constantly monitors and adjusts each shock absorber.  Now back in 2006, I attended a Lexus test drive event and was able to drive an IS350 back to back with an E90 330i. Now the IS was MUCh faster (butt Dyno), but BMW took care of that in 2007 with the twin turbo 335i. I thought the BMW was a better driving car (brakes, steering, suspension). Things are different today. The BMW still puts up good numbers (328i & 335i), but they have also gotten softer and are much less engaging to drive. Maybe the playing field has evened out."

3337,"December 11, 2014  2:21PM",markcincinnati,"Roadburner -- you crack me up! Of course the Cheap Trick quip suggests you've been around the sun quite a few times (as have I).  Two of my friends (one is an aunt) acquired new ELLPS (1 Lexus and 1 Infiniti) cars. One of these folks (who will remain otherwise unidentified) was going from one city to another about 30 miles apart. The call to me proclaimed ""the GPS lady gives incorrect instructions"" -- and my friend ended up in a city some 60 miles in the wrong direction.  Now, I have had numerous GPS systems, my first in 2001. I have had the experience where the GPS lady did indeed provide incorrect directions (but I still arrived at my destination, just with a long detour). The last time I had a car provide wrong directions was in 2004.  The ""science"" of GPS technology and the map makers themselves have improved greatly is the point. Or perhaps the point is the GPS lady was not wrong -- and if you would have followed her directions you would not be 60 miles out of the way.  I said nothing to my friend.  I am thinking I will suggest a return visit to the dealership for a ""training class"" on the marvelous tech these Japanese cars afford. Of course, my other friend was unaware of the car's sat radio tuner and when I turned the radio to the sat band and found Classic Vinyl, my friend was amazed -- no commercials and tons of music.  Analogy: Maybe we've reached the point where CD's and iPods or iPhones (for music) are good enough and DVD-Audio despite its amazing quality, is just not worth it to most folks.  I remember, too, Sprint spent a ton of money on the sound quality of their network only to find people would rather have fewer dropouts than hi-fi sound from their cell phone network.  These cars have lots of tech, to be sure -- but other than the folks reading and writing here on Edmunds, I wonder who is actually using automatic cruise control, lane keeping, in-car Internet and even google earth (which is, at least, pretty cool to play with even if it is not really all that practical).  Have we reached some kind of saturation? Or are we all collectively waiting for ""Jarvis"" (in the Iron Man suit) to mature to the point where we don't have to learn anything to program our GPS other than to say ""I wanna go to Austin and avoid the Interstates.""  I'm back to wanting the performance of an S4 with the ride of an A8 -- that plus an upgraded sound system and I'd be fine. The current gen of GPS and the other tech is probably acceptable to folks like you and me, since we actually (apparently) take the time to learn to program it.  I'm clearly not waiting on Jarvis, but he can't get here soon enough."
3338,"December 11, 2014  2:49PM",graphicguy,"Mark....interesting take, as always.  I think some of the safety nannies fall in the category, ""we had the sensors on the compute power. So, it was easy to do""....by the manufacturers.  I do like lane departure warning. Not so much the ""Lane Keep"" features. I have front end collision mitigation which I'll assume works, as I don't want to test it out.  GPS in cars is to the point where the ones I've used are extremely accurate. I expect that's a feature that will come with just about all cars in the not so distant future, given most have a ""cutout"" that was engineered in the dash for some sort of screen.  At some point I'm waiting to hear of the drunk guy who was pulled over for crossing a yellow line and got a DUI. His defense will be ""no way...I had lane keep feature on my car. There's no way that's possible."" Maybe RB can comment on the legalities of such a scenario.  It amazes me how far suspension technology has come. I now own a CTS with Magnetic Ride Control. It's pretty darn amazing. Aside from the car having nearly ideal weight distribution and weight reduction, the MRC keeps the wheels planted while the body stays tight, and the ride is superb.....kind of what you were talking about with an A8.  About DVD-As....I have a bunch of them. They are amazing sounding. Used to love listening to them in the car. No longer. I don't know of any cars that can play them in all their surround sound glory anymore.  So, I play them at home (where they sound even better). But, no one in my family just sits to listen to music any more. It's always a ""background"" activity."

BMW on the other hand - majority of 328 and up has premium package, which is leather. I really don't get it, especially that C-class is supposed to go ""upmarket"" as CLA filled the entry point. There are units there well in $50K+ and still no leather. I don't know - is that plastic MB-Tex so good? I just find it hard to believe... Not to mention that not a single one?"
3340,"December 11, 2014  3:24PM",carnaught,In my experience the MB-Tex is so good that the only major difference to me is that the leather is more aromatic. Tex may be actually more durable but I have no anecdotal or other proof of this.
3341,"December 11, 2014  4:14PM",markcincinnati,"The MB-Tex will eventually crack -- not the kind of cracks you can see in old leather, however.  The PLEATHER seats unlike real leather doesn't or can't breathe. Of course with modern seat ventilation technology, that may be less of an issue.  I'm still of the ""leather is better"" opinion -- but I remember ONE TIME ordering a new Audi 5000CS turbo quattro with wool seats (leather was standard and wool was a special order at no cost option). These seats, in many ways, were the most comfortable ever. Not cold in winter, not hot in summer (mine were heated, too).  The issue, with gray seats, was dirt. Well, OK, not ""dirt dirt"" but coffee, mustard, coke and other drinks, ice cream droppings and, I would imagine all sorts of other messes should one have kids in the car. A good old french fry stain would be a heart breaker.  Now, I did put sheepskin seat covers on the front buckets -- and that helped. But as good as the wool seats were, I was one and done.  I have no doubt MB-Tex is good fake leather, or faux leather -- but give me the real thing."
3342,"December 11, 2014  4:20PM",roadburner," I'm not against quality in-car audio systems or decent navigation systems. My issue is that today's buyers are usually distracted by the ""shiny things"" that are tangential at best to the overall driving experience.  As for crossing the center line and the lane keep feature? It would depend on the individual case, and the competence of the judge and counsel. Me, I'd probably let the defendant argue that- assuming he could prove his car had that feature.  As an aside, the judiciary has one of the highest automotive illiteracy rates of virtually any profession. A couple of judges in my district would take voluminous notes if they were hearing a case involving vehicle repairs, etc., take the case under submission, and give the notes to me so that I could sift the wheat from the chaff..."
3343,"December 11, 2014  4:25PM",roadburner," That's also been my experience with BMW's ""Leatherette."" The only reason I would choose leather is because I wanted a color that was only available in cowhide.

3348,"December 11, 2014  5:01PM",ab348," Heh... I went down that road in 2007. I had all these crates full of vinyl records I had bought from the mid-70s until I finally bought a CD player in the early '90s that were just gathering dust. My old turntable had issues and wasn't easily repairable. And my receiver had a bad channel. So I went the retro route, first locally-sourcing stuff, later going the ebay route. I ended up with several turntables, several old 1970s Pioneer receivers, a few cassette decks, new old speakers, totally retro. That lasted not quite a year before I lost interest. Yes, it sounds good, but I seem to have lost that desire for the one true sound that I once had. Now it is all gathering dust again."
3349,"December 11, 2014  5:03PM",graphicguy," FN....it's a long story. Reader's Digest version, I got a deal I couldn't pass up. Had a couple of hiccups, but they seem to be sorting themselves out. Cadillac is really stepping it up. CTS has turned into something I never would have expected. They're shooting at E class, 5 Series, and A6, and bulls eyeing the targets, in some ways, exceeding what the others are doing.  Test drove the ATS a couple of times. That car's a blast, too. You'd like it.  Leather....I've heard the argument that Mercedes ""pleather"" is better than leather. That mostly came from their dealers. However their fake stuff may or may not wear well, I'm sure it's cheaper for them than putting leather in their cars.  Even old leather looks great. Not sure that old vinyl will look all that good down the road. I know old vinyl never smells good. To me, it's a cost cutting move by Mercedes. I can't imagine paying $50K? $60K? Maybe more, and not getting leather as part of the package.  If I were going to see any potential problem with the new TLX, it would have been with their transmissions. Acura/Honda has had a bit of a history with dicey transmissions. I really like the TLX. I hope they get that shift button thing sorted out in short fashion, and it will only take once. They are kind of on a sales roll with their vehicles right now. It would be a shame that this would bring them to a halt. If they've stopped selling the TLX, it looks like that's exactly what happened, though. I can't imagine how long it will take for then to identify the cause, come up with a fix, and get all those cars in the shops to make the fix. Hope it works out well for them.  Thanks for the professional opinion RB. I'm waiting to hear that defense in a DUI case sooner rather than later."
3350,"December 11, 2014  8:36PM",dino001,"I'm with Graphic on leather. I drove several loaners with the ""ette"" and they did not feel that great. Rough touch, dull color and of course smell. All the ""tex"", ""ette"" stuff is to me selling a simple fake for a price of real stuff (50 grand or more) and great legend so they can cash the profit - and charging extra if you insist on real stuff. Well, they obviously can get away with that. Especially Benz. I see BMWs have much higher percentage of real leather, but new 320 may buck the trend.  If not leather, I would rather choose premium microfiber seats (if they made), just like for a couch, as those at least would be better in hot-and-cold sweat absorption, be nicer in touch and even stronger than leather. And it doesn't pretend to be something else."
3351,"December 11, 2014 10:26PM",flightnurse,"While at the MB dealer we test drove a ML250 that had the fake stuff, at first I didn't know it was fake, it felt like leather, and the contrasting stitching really elevated the whole look.  CG, I'm still not sold on the new CTS, having driving one a couple of months back over 600 miles I just couldn't get comfortable in it. I'm just surprised how you made a 180 turn around and even went and drove one."

The cts was car of the year - but poor gm they can't get out of own way when it comes to bad headlines.

Still seems kind of pricey to me, but pretty well loaded.

3364,"November 26, 2014  1:35AM",markcincinnati,"Some quick (for me) follow ups:  Equipped pretty much to the max, the SQ5 (Prestige) will be in the $60's. A ""nicely equipped,"" but hardly Porsche equipped pretty much to the max will be close to $10K more. My Audi dealer says the Porsche will be almost $15K more ""similarly"" loaded.  I don;t know how accurate that latter claim is, but the Macan S can easily go well into the $70's and the Macan Turbo can pass $100K -- but it will be about a half second quicker than the S and the SQ5.  The US SQ5 is also sold only with a set ground clearance, and the Macan is both lower and can be had with an adjustable suspension.  Those who want more headroom, too, will consider the SQ5 since its proportions are more generous for rear seat passengers and their stuff. I thought the two cars were redundant, and I can still convince myself of that, but I can also see the Macan appealing to a different audience, but then, at the price, the Macan is now able to actually be more expensive than a Cayenne.  I'd test them both unless you have a specific purpose that only one or the other fulfills.  The SQ5 does have more HP and torque, and an 8 speed non-dsg transmission -- to the Macan's 7-spd PDK.  Both are very fine examples of excess -- in a CUV suit. We have 25,000 miles on our SQ5 -- and would get another in a heartbeat and we have driven both cars; we like the higher ground clearance of the Audi and the nearly $10,000 lower price is a plus too.  The S6, at its price, doesn't seem to have an analog from the other Germans. The BMW 535 doesn't even come close and the 550 isn't as sticky as the S6 (thanks to quattro).  I can't really call the S6 a bargain, but it does offer the buyer more content for the MSRP than the BMW. I'd avoid the 20"" wheels, but that is a personal choice.  I floored the S6 and counted to 3 -- when I looked down I had gone beyond 100MPH from about 60. Nothing I've driven (other than a Corvette) even comes a little bit close.  The S6, to me, seems just a bit too big, just like my S4 seems a bit too small -- so I look forward to a larger S4, although the S6 is my ""lust for"" car.  The least talked about ""car"" if you axe me, is the SQ5 -- it is a vehicle that deserves a bit more exposure. Too bad the Macan is likely to steal the show, being that it is, after all, a Porsche."
3365,"November 26, 2014 10:15PM",brian125,"When I was at the Audi dealership I was talking to a guy getting a oil change on his SQ5. Absolutely loves this vehicle. Claims the ride and handling is phenomenal. price tag was up there thou. Didn't actually see one there.  I find the S6 a little smaller inside for me. At 6'1 with 2 back surgery's under my belt and weighting closer to a quarter pounder with cheese area these days Car size, getting in and out is priority. In a perfect world I would love the S8 interior dimensions in the size of a S-6 but with a S6 price tag. That being said my dilemma which probably is not a bad one is replacing my 13, R-spec Genesis for a S6, or trading my 2012, BMW X-5 with 30k miles and buying the Q-7.  I originally went to dealership to test drive the Q7 and wound up driving a 2015, S-6. I Love this vehicle or lust for it............ maybe both.. This car is the total package. So I'm either going for 2 shots in the ribs for a Hyundai trade in or 1 hard slap in the face for the X-5. I'm hoping my golf buddy takes my X-5 off my hands. Then my decision will be a lot easier.

The following list of – hopefully descriptive – terms, apply to the latter activity, or better said apply as descriptive terms of the test-driven car, this past Friday (the day after the food coma).  Clarification of the terms, that is how they may be applied, is noted (in parentheses):  -Aroused (you don’t start this car, you press the button on the console and it is “aroused”)  -Audacious  -Bland-looking (dashboard)  -Brutish  -Close (front seat)  -Cramped (back seat)  -Crude-ish  -Dart-y  -Expensive (unfortunately, equipped as it apparently needs to be equipped, it is easily 10-15% too much money for a car that has luxury intentions but doesn’t deliver much luxury despite its long list of features)  -Fast (as in, “How fast would you like to go sir, I can manage 150 if that would be sufficient.”)  -Firm (harsh-es kinder gentler side; this car is capable of firm only on the smoothest of road surfaces and/or above 85MPH)  -Fun (to drive for relatively short distances)  -Harsh (on secondary roads you are punished over every patched pot-hole you drive over, pounded by every expansion joint you meet and slammed when you drive over the various undulations presented by our aging highway infrastructure)  -Jittery (think hum while strumming your lips)  -Loud (road noise, wind noise is minimal)  -Minimalist (the large expanse of black plastic on the section of the dash in front of the passenger isn’t exactly cheap looking, no, it’s not that, it just looks boring, unimaginative, perhaps like there is some carbon fiber or brushed aluminum trim piece that was accidentally omitted)  -Nervous (the car, not me)  -Nimble (turns like a go-kart)  -Noisy (not much isolation from the engine or the road – makes conversation at speed require LOUD TONES even for the two front-seat passengers; I could imagine it would require yelling for back-seat passengers to hear or to be heard)  -Powerful (not quite OMG, but very much like a two-year old V8 Mustang, in fine tune)  -Precise (I imagine it feels like a Swiss watch, if you could actually drive one, that is)  -Punishing (see harsh above, but add to it a couple of kidney punches thrown in just so you don’t get the impression this car could be, in any way, considered supple)  -Quality (the feel of the switchgear is like a German chef’s knife in your hand – makes other knives (and other cars) feel just a tad bit of a lesser tool)  -Quick (dart-y could have sufficed, and “quick” is not the same as “fast” – this car is seriously quick at 0-62 in 4.7 seconds)  -Raucous (the road and tire noise would argue against a cross-country trip in this car)  -Raw (I guess I need to point out that it is also – in some ways – refined (see below), at least in terms of the power-train)  -Refined (the fit and finish are great, the doors close with nary even a hint of a tinny sound, everything is solid)  -Responsive  -Rough (you probably could have deduced this by now, but I need you to know that this only applies to the ride – the engine is like buttah)  -Sensitive (have you ever seen an old movie about a safe-cracker; you know the guy who sandpapers his fingertips before he begins turning the dial – his fingertips are sooo sensitive he can “feel” the tumblers falling into place; well, this car is sanded fingertips sensitive)  -Slick (the transmission, although “only” a six-speed, this transmission mates nicely with the smooth, powerful engine)  -Smooth (the engine)  -Solid (like a brick, you know what)  -Sonorous (the engine – ok, here’s a preliminary reveal – you would not be blamed if you thought this engine was a 6 or 8 cylinder with an old-fashioned air-sucking, honking wildly, air-intake; but you’d be wrong, this engine is the devil’s own 4-banger, avert your eyes, carry garlic cloves and cover yourself with wolfs bane just in case)  -Stiff (harsh-es kinder, gentler, cousin)  -Sublime (the seats are so good in this car they could almost make you forget its boy-racer characteristics)  -Tense (this thing is really on-edge once it is put in gear)  -Tight (jam up and jelly tight – I never knew what that meant in the song, but it seems to fit here) [I've been told Jam up and Jelly tight is a sexual reference, so I'll let it stand]  -Tiring (again, lovely car to drive about 20 miles, maybe even 25 miles; just not the kind of thing you’d want to take long trip – even of a 100 miles – in repeatedly. . . you’d just be worn out from the, er, Sturm und Drang  -Twitchy  -Urgent  -Unyielding  -Violent  -Visceral  -Wearying (see tiring – in short this is a $50,000 go-kart; and, there is nothing wrong with that, but I think, given the car’s lack of Premium-ness, I’d go for the Subie WRX and pocket the difference).  Much to like, a bit less not to like, but overall “at these prices” you do have the choice of giving yourself kidney punches and endure about the same cacophony (maybe less, even) in the Subaru WRX.  The car in question?  A 2015 Audi S3 with the Prestige and Sport packages, plus the upgraded seats, trim and premium paint.  I so wanted to love this car – and I must compliment Audi on figuring out how to make a 4 cylinder growl and snarl -- and yes I know it is partially the work of the audio system, but who cares? (all the while being as smooth as silk) like a Mustang V8 (circa 2012) – but the thing, as fun as it is to drive for a relatively short distance, just doesn’t feel like it is a Premium Class car (beyond the interlocking 4 rings on the front and rear) – it feels like what I imagine Subaru is shooting for and largely doing (but for a lot less money) with their current WRX's.  The Audi’s 19” wheels and tires may well be the culprit, but the almost total lack of sound deadening (well, OK, not really) just doesn’t do it for me (especially when the thing is north of $50K). Getting out of an S3 and then driving off in an S4 is like night and day. The S4 may be more isolated, better at mastering road imperfections and designed to press your kidneys rather than punch them, and that’s what makes even the “old” tech 2015 S4 still a bunch more car for just a little more money and the S4 actually feels and looks like the 4-rings suggest it ought to feel and look like.  Oh, BTW, the S3 has fantastic LED headlights – and the thing is a looker. But $50,000+? Nah.   Keep on driving it like YOU live. I couldn't live with this car -- dammit!"

3395,"November 10, 2014  9:20PM",markcincinnati," ===== Here goes: =====  I'll stick with the A3 & A4 to introduce a new forum class for ""LPS"" [suffix'd] cars.  For the moment, let's say the ELLPS class is solidly where the new A3 belongs, To me, that seems to suggest the A4 (and the 2016 A4 leaps to mind) is no longer an ELLPS, nor is it an LPS, since the A6 is the representative of the LPS entry from Audi.  Well, two LPS classes used to be sufficient -- but over the past few years car companies have scrambled to ""find a hole"" in the market and create a new car model to plug it. And, no hole seems either too big or too little -- model proliferation is the norm these days.  Audi and BMW (and Mercedes too) have become the masters of model proliferation, it seems.  And, just about ""everybody"" demonstrates ""wheelbase"" [or overall length] and girth growth every time they birth the new generation of a model. The BMW 3, for instance, has grown so much so that it is, in many ways, larger than a not-that-old 5 series. The current A4 used to be the size of the new A3 -- and when the current A4 was introduced in the US as a 2009 model it's wheelbase was within a fraction of an inch of the size of the then current A6. I know, I had a 2005 A6 that I kept for 6 months after the lease ended so that I could move to the new A4 and not have any period of time where I was not in an Audi. When the 2009 A4 came in to the dealer, I pulled my A6 up beside it -- and it was virtually impossible to tell the difference between the two with respect to wheelbase.  The A4 got big! Then, when the new gen A6 came out, it, of course, grew in size -- the A3 was in the pipeline (not the 2009 A3, which was essentially a VW) and what we have in the brand new A3 is a car that plugs the hole left by the move up of the A4 into what used to be the size class of the A6, Numerous examples of this phenomenon can be cited for the cars that come from BMW, Mercedes, Cadillac and Lexus.  We now have -- at least -- 3 size (and price) categories for cars to fit into and still be, in some fashion (class) LPS cars. ELLPS, ILLPS & LPS is my proposal.  ILLPS means Intermediate Level LPS also known as a member of the phylum: Luxoperforiososedantis.  So, assuming we all accept the notion that three LPS classes are now appropriate, we move the current (and certainly 2016's upcoming) A4, 3 series and C class (while were sticking with the Germans) to the ILLPS forum and open up the new, 'blank slate', ELLPS board (forum) for cars like the new Audi A3, BMW 2 series (which may be problematic since it doesn't have 4-doors as far as I know) and the Mercedes CLA (which is a 4-door coupe, according to MB). We move the CTS firmly to the LPS forum and put the ATS in with the ILPS cars if its wheelbase (among other things) doesn't force it into the ELLPS class.  I would think wheelbase would be one criteria, total length and width of the car two additional criteria, base price and 90% maximum price yet an additional criteria, and so forth.  Which brings me to perception.  I cannot -- YET -- place the Hyundai Genesis (for example) in the mix of LPS anything; however, there is a strong resemblance to some of the phylum's class members at least insofar as luxury content is concerned. I would assume the Genesis will be an LPS member someday.  Perhaps time in the market is a criteria -- no one wants a poser -- and it takes time to earn your place in phylum Luxoperforiososedantis.  In any case, the time has come for the current ELLPS suspects to move to the ILLPS forum.  At least I think so."

But it does have a very large back seat.  Headroom? First I heard anyone complain about that on the RDX. I normally have issues (large Torso to leg ratio!), and some cars like the 2001 TL I just could not drive without my head jammed in the roof. But I don't come close to hitting in the RDX.

3423,"October 31, 2014 10:20PM",stickguy,"My wife wanted the nice blue badly, but they only offered it on the MDX. The dark gray we got is nice though, and we have the tan interior. Gray would have been nice too."
3424,"October 31, 2014 10:21PM",markcincinnati,"The RDX is FWD biased and currently can't be had with what used to be the RDX's secret sauce, SH-AWD. The RDX is certainly nice looking and is, as noted, high content for the money.  It is, however, an appliance, a very good appliance but rather unremarkable if you are looking for anything beyond modest (and I think that is generous) performance.  The RDX, like all Acura's is probably one of the most reliable and I would, therefore, assume durable vehicles in the small to mid size CUV universe.  Life, as I now know, being north of 60, is too short for boring cars.  My vote would be for the X3 of the choices suggested -- but I did much appreciate the XC60 T6 when I floored the accelerator -- the thing has some serious torque, the X3 (at the price point) couldn't even come close.  The X3 however felt like it was on rails.  Here is the test I use -- I find a curve on a secondary road -- a very lightly traveled secondary road. I look for a curve marked 15mph or 20mph (at most). Then I approach the curve at more than double the posted speed; next I brake hard for a moment to reduce speed to double the posted speed and to force a weight transfer to the front wheel. As I enter the curve at 30mph, I accelerate hard as soon as the front wheels have passed the mid point of the curve.  If the car easily remains in its lane, I repeat the process at triple the posted speed.  The X3 easily handles this ""experiment"" and the feeling is that it could go at the corner at more than 3x the posted ""suggested"" speed. The RDX (old version with the turbo 4 and SH-AWD could do this all day.) The new one plows and crosses the center line. The XC60 was a T6 Type R and it felt in good control of its understeering urges too. But the Volvo was much closer to its limit since it didn't shift enough power aft since there technically was no actual loss of traction.  The X3 was the natural -- were money no object, the X3 with the i6 turbo would clearly be the one to get if you wanted some salt and pepper on your ""meat."""
3425,"October 31, 2014 10:28PM",stickguy,"well, as always, money comes into play. Big difference between stretching from a ""normal"" CUV to an RDX in the low-mid 30s, and jumping to a European hot rod for 50k+, if not pushing 60 large.  Modest performance? If you mean acceleration, given that it does 0-60 in the low 6's, you have some awfully high standards! We obviously travel in different automotive standard circles!"

3427,"October 31, 2014 10:58PM",flightnurse," What was the reason for your wife getting the SQ5? over the X3? I find the interior of the Q5 a much more inviting environment over the X3, but the X3 did handle better I thought."
3428,"October 31, 2014 11:30PM",carnaught,"Mark, entertaining posts, as usual."
3429,"November  1, 2014  2:38PM",markcincinnati,"Simply put, the SQ5 -- even at its price point -- offered more content, the immpeccable interior Audi seems to do with aplomb, and oh that supercharged engine with zero lag, weapons grade torque -- and the SQ5 had a gorgeous red leather interior to boot.  To get the same or similar content, the BMW was even more expensive; and I think she felt the SQ5's interior, sport seats in particular plus the B&O sound system cinched it -- almost. Panther Black Pearl paint sealed the deal. That plus a 6% discount on NOT your garden variety Q5 or X3 -- Audi iimbues its ""S"" cars with ""that certain something"" -- undoubtedly sealed the deal.  Having matching interiors was probably a minor influencer, too.  She has had 2 X3's since 2005 -- very fond of them. But, if you've never driven an SQ5 at full cry, you may not quite understand the almost immediate reaction: An ""addiction"" to the sound and the fury, wrapped up in what seems to be a premium CAR -- the BMW for all of its inherent goodness just doesn't seem as nice of a place to spend hours in. Then, of course, there is that oh-so-cute flat bottomed sport steering wheel on the SQ, too.  If you can take an SQ5 out for a test drive.  On the other hand . . .  The BMW is better balanced -- but the SQ passes the triple speed around the curve test with ease and poise. As a practical matter, that attribute felt pretty much like a draw, despite the BMW's less heavy nose. The Audi engineers did a very nice job taming the potetial understeer of the SQ's fatter front-end.  Just test drive an SQ -- perhaps you too will want to keep on driving it, long aafter the test drive ends. One more thing, the SQ5 is very rare, you won't see yourself coming and going -- the X3 even with the more potent i6 motivation is rather easy to find, and unlike the SQ seems to do little to differentiate itself from the ""regular"" X3."
3430,"November  1, 2014  2:45PM",stickguy,"isn't the Q5 interior (and cargo area) on the small side for the class? I remember looking at them before we got the RDX, and I have it in my head that it seemed very tight in the back."

3433,"November  2, 2014  7:54PM",markcincinnati,"And the punchline is: ""He Only Took Tips!""  A tip for those who are either owners of or contemplating one of these ELLPS or ELLPSUV/CUV's -- assuming the vehicle in question is not a BMW.  Here goes: many, probably most of these cars tend toward -- or outright already have -- some degree of nose heaviness. Audi is certainly not known for ""50 - 50"" weight balance, for instance. Acura, Volvo and most certainly others (again not BMW) are absolutely nose heavy when configured as 2WD vehicles (since they mostly are FWD when ordered thusly). More and more of these ELLP vehicles are ordered every year with 4-driven wheels (the up take here in SW Ohio is now for ""mostly"" AWD versions -- even most BMW's and Mercedes are acquired with AWD so say the dealers). Alas, even the AWD versions are nose-heavy.  The thing that I've learned that is a quick, easy and virtually free way to improve upon some of the effects of being a bit porky on the front is to inflate the front tires +2 pounds more than the rear tires; and, typically to inflate the fronts to one or two pounds MORE than the factory sticker suggests.  My S4 says to inflate the tires at max to 42 pounds. I inflate front to 43 and rear to 41 (using the free nitrogen ""air"" Costco offers its members).  We had a cold snap here in River City yesterday -- of course the air pressure in all four tires dropped dramatically -- we went from 70+ degrees to overnight temps in the upper teens with a daytime high an optimistic 41.  Since I was at Costco getting my fill up of their Top-Tier premium, I also went for the free air fill-up. Based on the length of time before the ""ding"" indicating 43 pounds, the pressure had to have been over 5 or 6 pounds below that.  To ensure the tires were cold, I drove to Costco, parked and went shopping in the store for a while, then went to the tire dept for my fill-up.  I kid you not -- and I've known this for years, yet I was as pleasantly surprised as could be -- the turn-in was IMMEDIATELY sharper, like the car had been placed on a set of shiny new rails.  OK, that is the ""free"" (as in almost zero cost) tip.  Here's one, that when coupled with the above free tip, will further dramatically improve your heavy nosed (and this one works on any car) ELLP vehicle's steering dynamics: switching out of the factory tires (unless certain tires are already on your ELLP car) into the top of the line performance tires in the class (of tire) that you would normally drive.  For example -- here in SW Ohio -- no one (well, virtually no one) uses ""summer"" and ""winter"" tires -- they use either ""summer"" tires year round or (more likely) all-season tires, year round.  The Germans have even gone so far as to specify as no cost options, typically, the ability to order your car with summer only or all season rubber. Dealers typically order their for-stock vehicles with all-season rubber to keep their customers from complaining about the super fast tire wear and the almost unusable traction summer tires offer to those of us who do have temps that go below 40 - 45 degrees from time to time (our typical winters are usually above freezing, but usually below 45 which is the kryptonite temp for summer only tires).  The thing is, a lot of the ""all-season"" tires are either Grand Touring tires or are simply H rated all-seasons (generally from a well-known brand and generally with a fairly long tread-life expectation).  My S4 came with H rated Grand Touring tires. What were they thinking? Offered up to order is an S4 with either summer or all-season tires. I checked the all-season box since, well, you know, I live in Cincinnati and we really (usually) have very mild winters in terms of both temp and snowfall. Why do I need dedicated winter tires in my climate, so to speak?  I don't.  Grand Touring tires are fine -- but, if you ax' me they have no business on an Audi S car of any stripe.  What is better -- much much better? Easy-peasy: an Ultra-High Performance All-Season tire from one of the name brands all of the German's buy from. We ended up with Continental ExtremeContact DWS Ultra High Performance All-Seasons from Tire Rack -- shipped to the dealer, installed and road-force balanced. These tires should have their picture placed beside the word ""sticky"" in your Merriam-Webster.  They have super-stiff (compared to the rather comfy-biased Grand Touring H rated rubber that the S4 came with) sidewalls and they are Y speed-rated. Of course, since I ordered my car with the all-season tire option, Audi saw fit to engage a max-speed limiter that tops out at 130 (easily switched off, if you really think you're going to need to exceed 130MPH).  So, you can, for relatively little money (close to zero) noticeably improve your ELLP's turn-in, gas mileage and overall handling by simply cranking up the fronts to +2 pounds over the rears and by cranking up the front 1 or 2 pounds over the door jam's ""suggestion.""  Then for what will probably amount to $700 to $1,000 all-in (but for some of these cars that you can order 20"" wheels, the $ amount will be higher), you can take the next big step and get rid of the almost certainly ""wimpy"" tires the manufacturers seem to put on these cars when the ""no summer only"" tire option is checked.  Virtually all of these ELLPS, ELLPSUV/CUV vehicles are nose heavy -- which manifests itself as under-steer. It is unlikely you can, as the saying goes, put lipstick on a pig and turn it into a Porsche in the handling department -- but, with my hand raised on high, I can attest that by doing both of the suggested tips above, I even transformed my TL Advance from somewhat of a farm-implement (i.e., it could tend to ""plow"" a little bit even with SH-AWD) due to its less than ideal 60-40 (or something like that) F/R weight distribution) into a confidence inspiring and -- with a consideration for its price -- ""S4-light"" ELLPS.  Of course, in the case of the Acura TL Advance w/SH-AWD the 19"" H rated tires that it came with couldn't have sucked anymore even if their name was Hoover (I crack myself up).  So, my friends and fellow posters, if you're laying out something north of $45,000, you can for no to relatively low money transform your baby from ""nice"" to a vehicle that, quoting my wife, ""goes like a snake in a rat hole.""  If you play your cards right, you can make the UHP all-seasons (or whatever you and your ""climate"" could call optimum) part of the purchase/lease deal when you order the car or before you sign on the dotted line to buy/lease one off the lot.  Hopefully the above will have some merit and even more $ value and most of all ""fun to drive"" value for at least one forum participant.  Drive it . . . oh hell, you know the rest."

3439,"November  3, 2014  7:54PM",markcincinnati,"Continental ExtremeContact DWS Ultra High Performance All-Seasons have, as some here have alluded to, been somewhat dethroned in the most recent Tire Rack test:  ""Michelin has reset the performance standard for an all-season tire with their Pilot Sport A/S 3, which delivers impressive handling in both dry and wet conditions. And while not apparent during our short road evaluation, when running laps on our test track at the limit this tire showed a little more tread wear than the others tires. But this focus on ultimate performance during the summer months compromises its wintertime capabilities somewhat. The Bridgestone Potenza RE970AS Pole Position is a pleasure to drive, with a satisfying feel in the steering wheel and good handling in dry and wet conditions. However, it falls way short of what most drivers would consider adequate in winter conditions. The Continental ExtremeContact DWS doesn't quite have the nimble feel of the others, but offers good ride quality and reasonable handling along with good overall traction regardless of the weather - dry, wet or winter.""  I found the above @: http://www.tirerack.com/tires/tests/testDisplay.jsp?ttid=177  Now, having lived about 20,000 miles with the Contis DWS Ultra High Performance -- in Cincinnati's climate -- I would not hesitate to ""go again"" with the Contis.  If I lived perhaps 100 miles or so due south of Cincinnati, the Michelin Pilot Sport A/S 3's would certainly vie for my dollars.  The further north I might live, however, the Conti DWS UHP's would still be the ones to beat based on the Tire Rack review. The review does tend to make me think the DWS's are much more of a compromise than anything else, but they are much stiffer than the standard GT Contis that came with my S4, very quiet and they do improve the handling of the car as noted in my post regarding air pressure and tires.  It would appear that the Michelin's are the new standard in UHP all seasons, but the review seems to suggest they are not as all year round good as the Continentals.

3441,"November  3, 2014 11:44PM",brian125,I'm going to give a shout out for the Michelin Primacy MXV4.  Excellent tire with stellar reviews for a V or H rating . Like mark posted above with the new Premier A/S tire you no longer have to worry how long it will take to accomplish a panic stop while driving in a downpour because of the premiers tire wear.. which was not good before the upgrade.  Cant go wrong with either tire
3442,"November  4, 2014  2:17AM",sweendogy,"@markcincinnati‌ and others - the a/s UHP tires are really nice- I had a set on my old Infiniti made by goodyear that did the trick - BUT even though they are nice ""What is better -- much much better? Easy-peasy:"" is dedicated set of summer UHP and dedicated winters set up if you indeed would like to use the S to its real performance / utility abilities. My set up is as such- summer on car now and in profile pix are 19 Zr 255/35 conti extremes. Winter we go 18 R 235/45 winter sport dunnies on standard rims. Talking max grip when weather is nice, - sport diff helps as well. In the winter it's a billy goat with Quattro. Dedicated winters are where it's at if you have to deal with tough winters/ I know there has been some debate about this but its a fact, they work wonders no matter what drive wheels are pushing or pulling the sled."
3443,"November  4, 2014  2:57AM",roadburner,"UHP all seasons are fine year round for vehicles like my son's X3 truck, but I run summer rubber and switch to either winter tires or UHP all seasons in early December on most everything else in the stable- even my wife's E90 328i snoozemobile. In any event, I have a Wrangler Sahara equipped with winter rubber in case the snow really piles up."
3444,"November  4, 2014  3:52AM",markcincinnati,"sween and roadb -- you two are doing it the way that it really SHOULD be done. I assume I am in the majority who just aren't willing or perhaps even mentally willing to spend on two sets of tires. I admit the solution you two have chosen is superior.  My original point was to suggest tips that would improve your (our) lot in life -- if we live in a place that has moderate winters or in a city that mitigates the impact of snow with super human snow removal and lots of road chemicals.  Were I a resident of, say, Minnesota or North Dakota or perhaps even Michigan, I may feel the need for four dedicated winter shoes.  Were I the type to really push my car (S or no) to more than 85%, perhaps that too would argue in favor of summer MAX Performance tires (my 2009 A4 did come with MAX performance 35 series 19"" x 255's -- they lasted 11,000 miles).  I like to drive somewhat at a higher level than, I assume, most US drivers. I have a car that allows me to be a better driver than I probably am (in real life); I have been to 4 Audi driving schools in Austria, one Porsche school in little ol' Dayton, Ohio and a BMW X-drive school in South (and North) Carolina.  I have the schoolin' and the car to get 'er done -- therefore, I find my skills and my car to be under-tired with the mostly crappy all-seasons manufacturers foist upon Americans who (mostly like me) don't do what you two do.  I am lobbying the manufacturers (Audi in my case) to consider stepping up to UHP A/S's rather than the much lower ""performance"" rubber most manufacturers shod their cars with when the customer orders ""non-Summer"" tires.  I take my hat off to your two who are willing and able to not go for the optimum, rather electing to go for the maximum you can get, even if it means changing your wheels and tires out twice per year.  For those who aren't willing to walk the walk (that would be me) of the twice yearly ritual, all I am hoping to convey is that there is a much much better performing car waiting to be let loose if you will at least upgrade to UHP A/S;s rather than not even know what you're missing.  You two, indeed, drive it like you live. I applaud your behavior but I'm still OK with mine.  You might say, and I do, that good is the enemy of great. In this case, I'll say what I am looking for is to graduate from good to very good -- which still remains the enemy of greatness, but in this instance, I, for one, am willing to live with it."
3445,"November  5, 2014  2:01AM",sweendogy,"Now in my second swap out and mark I agree it's not the best- I don't know the perfect date to do the swap- don't want to wait to long and hit a patch of ice on slicks or drive to long on the harder winters in decent mild weather. The cost to swap is not cheap when also buying another set of rims along with the cost of tires. The goodyear a/s UHP I had on the G - they did the trick just fine. They def rode a little harsher then the standard G tires and were better in the sun- but the G on the old set (when new) was better in the snow with the standard non UHP - a/s. No perfect answer in this equation, unless you move to either Arizona or Alaska. I would go to Zona."

I compared the suspension to an E350 when I, test drove it. Tech is better than Mercedes, too. It's finished nicely and has great, premium materials, too. IMHO, it had the best stereo in the biz (ELS). Tranmission shifted quick and smooth enough you won't notice (similar to my E92 335i). Acura prgrammed the trans well.

The 175 horsepower is nothing to brag about, but it does get me up to speed.  I really like the CVT. If I wasn't such a car nut, I'd have no idea this wasn't a conventional automatic. The CVT is quite responsive and very smooth. It adds to the Legacy's overall character and refinement. I haven't had the traffic conditions to ""wring it out"" yet, but the car doesn't ""beg"" to be driven hard like my 328xi did. Good thing too.

3470,"October 26, 2014  6:44PM",markcincinnati,"S4 M3  Much as I love my S4, the M3 and S4 aren't in the same class -- Audi's S4 is the competitor to the BMW 335 (and to be fully comparative, the BMW would have to be an X-drive version.)  There is no RS4 (US) available which would be the M3's competitor.  I believe the S4 used to be the M3 rival, but once ""RS's"" were introduced the ""S"" moved a step down the performance ladder.  The net of this is to clarify that the S4 is still in the ELLPS category, no matter how much it can be optioned to (well over $60K in a New York second).  For the record, I wouldn't kick a 335 out of bed for eating crackers -- hell, I'd even bring the crackers.  Perhaps I lucked out with my S4 -- based on the way I equipped it; it seems the ""distance"" between an all singing, all dancing, S-Line A4 and an S4 is remarkably short. If you're looking at an A4 with a bunch of options, the S4 with not so many options, is just a smidge more (on a lease) than the ""lesser"" 4.  My wife's SQ5, Prestige, too, was ""within reach"" of a Q5 3.0T -- and, like the A4 S4 comparison, the ""S"" cars are remarkable, almost thrilling, performers.  The top of the line versions of most of the ELLPS cars are -- almost universally -- great performers available for something far less than a King's ransom. And, what you end up with is very close to the driving fun of a true sports sedan.  Of course, the ""bottom of the line"" of the ELLPS cars is/are still firmly planted as a card carrying member of the ELLPS family. Yet, for folks who frequent these formums and the brand specific sites, my assumption is that very few of us look to the ELLPS brand of our dreams and think, ""I'm gettin' me a strippie . . . ."" My conclusion is that the mavens who are participating here are more likely than not to equip their cars with a lot of performance and tech options -- and probably a fair amount of ""L""uxury features too.  The ELLPS class here on Edmunds, IMHO, has to be one of the most active boards and enjoys the participation of mostly very passionate (and opinionated) car lovers.  Much as I love cars like the S6 (if there are many ""like"" the S6), I think the S4 ""class"" (ELLPS) is really where the action and drama lie.   I'm driving it like I (at age 63) live."
3471,"October 27, 2014 12:36AM",sweendogy,"Love the @markcincinnati‌ posts - flow so well. I also agree if 60k (msrp on my s4 was 57 and change) for Ellps is now the norm then the s4 (please get the sports diff for the 1k, it works magic) is the machine to beat even in its 5th year. I have to wonder thou what is ELLps- when I was looking at my G 35k was always a number I thought would be entry level lux. I really wonder what exactly is entry level performance and lux- Is it now 40k ? 50k? 60k? If it's over 50k and you are looking be hard pressed to find something better the s4- imo"
3472,"October 27, 2014 12:46AM",dino001,"It's hard to find a legitimate ELLPS below 40 grand. There are some nice ELLS below 40 k, but they lack the ""P"". Then there are also some nice ELPS, too, but their luxury scope is often limited to couple of nice features. Ok machines, but not ELLPS. Another part is base version vs. optioned. Not just leather, but engine, sports suspension, or engine, will change the machine dramatically."
3473,"October 27, 2014  1:05AM",stickguy,"I actually looked back to the beginning of this thread (from 2002!). I still think that the S4, 335i are a step up (middle level?). The TLX, A4, 320/328, S60 still fit the profile for EL."
3474,"October 27, 2014  1:41AM",sweendogy,@stickguy might have a real point - would add the Q50 and old G37 now q40 to the list as well. Bang for buck plus sudo lux I would find a better car then old g37 that bests fits. Or one could get a used 335 or s4 with a few miles.

3477,"October 31, 2014  6:38PM",flightnurse,"Interesting video, Rick and I started the look for his SUV, and we went to the Volvo dealer and drove a XC60 with the E-Drive engine, this is a Super and Turbo Charged 2 liter engine, rated at 302hp and 295lbs of torque. Just as this video shows, the S60 just walks away from the TLX, as did the XC60 very impressed with the amount power it makes. So for 50K you get a fully loaded top of the line Volvo XC60 that can run with the other guys. I noticed that invoice for this SUV is 48K and people having been paying under invoice for it, also if you do the Euro Delivery you save 5% of the purchase price, PLUS 2 round trip tickets to Sweden, hotel stay (one night) and 15 days of insurance. This sweetens the deal a lot..  We also liked the Q5, a lot, and the 3.0 TDI torque is way addictive, so far the interior of the Q5 is our fave... The X3 was nice, the 2 liter diesel was hard press to complain about the power, We have more SUV's to look at, I'm looking forward in testing the Jeep Grand Cherokee with the diesel engine.  We drove a MDX, we both thought it was nice, but bulky and the lack of customizing made it fall off the list quickly. Now if you are on a budget and looking for a nicely loaded SUV then the MDX is one to look at. While at the dealer we look at the TLX and liked it, Acura did it right..."
3478,"October 31, 2014  7:16PM",markcincinnati,"I would agree with the 2002 observation -- and even agree perhaps for a number of years after 2002; but we're just about at the end of 2014. My point? Things have changed in 12 years.  The 335, the S4 and some incarnation of the Mercedes C class are ELLPS cars based on the places we could logically and appropriately place them.  And, while I am certain you could find ELLPS cars all day long with ""about"" a $40K price tag, it does seem -- now -- that because there is both a stronger ""P"" and ""L""component in the acronym (than 10-12 years ago), that the price of entry has probably crept up to a more realistic level of $45K or more.  As I mentioned, I believe that because folks here on Edmunds are er, more passionate, about cars and they really do want both the P and the L, ""strippies"" of some of the ELLPS cars are probably not what we're opining about here.  Now, along comes the new ELLPS class, perhaps?  What [or, perhaps, WHERE does it belong?] is an A3 or more pointedly an S3? It/they, today, could possibly be argued as deserving a footnote or honorary inclusion into the ELLPS class. But perhaps with the 2016 current ELLPS models looming ""larger"" (perhaps somewhat literally) than today's and certainly larger (for the most part) than the A3 (with its shorter wheelbase and girth), perhaps the entire current membership of the ELLPS family needs to be moved to a newly named forum vacating the ELLPS space thus allowing the A3, S3 and the soon to follow cars from Asia, Europe and the US, to fill in as the NEW NORMAL ELLPS cars.  Of course, if that happens, where does a BMW 3 or Audi A4 or Volvo S60 or TLX, Q50 or, or, or, end up? A 3 series will not be welcome in the LPS forum discussions -- will it? A 3 series is not a 5 series an A4 is not an A6, and so forth.  The lines blur, they come into focus, they blur again; the cars get bigger (almost univerally) every time a new generation is released. A 2014 3 series seems bigger, to me, than a 2003 5 series -- etc etc. So what was true in 2002 just doesn't carry on (my wayward son.)  What's between an ELLPS and an LPS anyway? PPPLPS - Popularly Priced Premium Luxury Performance Sedan (or would that be the step below ELLPS?) Or perhaps UMLPS - Updwardly Mobile Luxury Performance Sedan? Maybe NQQFBLPS - Not Quite Qualified to be a Full Blown Luxury Performance Sedan. No no, how 'bout ILLPS in keeping with the ""E"" for Entry -- we bump it up to: Intermediate Level Luxury Performance Sedan, and we move the current ELLPS players into the ILLPS class and move the up and coming ""Jr ELLPS's"" of today into the void left by moving the current folks from ELLPS to ILLPS and so on . . .  Yeah, that's the ticket.  Almost forgot: Boo! Happy Halloween!"
3479,"October 31, 2014  7:35PM",stickguy,"If you are looking at an x3 and xc90, should look at Acura RDX. Instead to be comparable.  Very quick and less bulky than an MDX. And quite a bit cheaper."
3480,"October  7, 2014  4:54PM",flightnurse,"Mark interesting thought, and you are probably right, look at the 335i 300hp and torque, with the MPPK and MPE you are looking at 335-340hp easily and BMW is very conservative with their HP rating. The current M3/4 makes 425hp (but a recent dyno test shows the M4 making 435hp at the rear wheel) so if Audi where to bring a RS4 you would right to saying it would be 400+hp, more like 450hp and not from a V8, but from a V6.  I have not driven a new M3/4 yet but from articles they are some scary machines, the amount of power they make can be very over whelming, do cars of that size need more HP? Right now, the biggest issue BMW has with the M3/4 is getting the rear wheels to hook up.  And Mark if I had a M4 and drove it like I lived, I wouldn't have a license..."
3481,"October  8, 2014  4:57PM",markcincinnati,"Flight -- even with the 333HP my S4 claims to have (which Motor Trend says is an understatement), I can only assume my time (to a speeding ticket) can now be measured -- at most -- in weeks.  Of course, with all the crazy people on I-71 North heading from Cinti to Columbus thinking 80MPH is a good place to START, well, there may be safety in numbers.  I can't seem to make this thing slow down -- I mean it seems that it keeps pushing me to go faster and the heck of it is, I'm too willing to abide.  I saw the Motor Week test report of the M3 -- talk about trying to control the wrath of gawd . . . . Even with the wider rear rubber the thing was wheel spin happy to the max.  I somehow doubt there will be an RS4 (or RS6) brought here -- the RS7 was, in my opinion, just a demonstration to show that Audi could bring a very high performance car to the US for what some see as a relative bargain. A higher output S4, well, that I am willing to bet will be brought here -- just like I'll bet there will be higher output ""335's"" brought here, too."

If you can afford to take it out of the garage for some pleasure driving 8 months out of the year that's fine. Last I looked the driving range was under 300 miles. That to me is unacceptable to travel around with a vehicle. Local driving this car is fine. I drive from NY to Myrtle beach 2 sometimes 3x a year. The Tesla wouldn't make it to M.D without stopping to charge up................ LOL.   Another problem is how many charging facilities are there through out the country.

3488,"October 11, 2014 10:34AM",brian125,"How about the Tesla Model X SUV. Is 70k worth a 95 mile range?   Base price: Currently unknown, but expected to be around $70,000.  Fuel economy: Unknown, but based on the Model S specs, expect a figure around 95 mpge from the 60kWh battery option.  Pros and cons: The Tesla Model X, expected out this fall, is the crossover to wait for if you want something truly different. In true Tesla style, it’s completely electric; it features falcon-wing doors that lift up and an all-wheel drive option that will make it the first production electric car to run on all fours; and it also has Tesla’s trademark 17-inch touchscreen center console. It has the usual EV drawbacks, though: limited range coupled with potentially long recharging times.  Options worth splurging on: It might come to the detriment of range, but the all-wheel drive model might be too good to pass up.  These vehicles are in the baby phases. Give this industry another 5 to 10 years with more research and cost cutting ways where most buyers can afford similar models like mentioned.   Tesla moved an estimated 4,600 Model S vehicles in the U.S. in the first three months of 2014 -- 1,600 in March and 3,100 in January/February. 11,000 vehicles have been sold to date this year.  The Nissan leaf ev leads all sales in the US with almost 22k units sold ytd. followed by the VOLT at 14k.  A post by a Tesla enthusiast compiling the ev-sales.blogspot.com numbers lists the total 2013 sales by European nation as: Norway - 1986 Netherlands - 1127 Switzerland - 213 Germany - 204 Belgium - 148 Denmark - 112 Austria - 48 France - 19 Italy - 8"

3496,"October 14, 2014  5:32PM",flightnurse,"Tesla is all about technology, while I was in San Jose in March of this year, my niece took me her favorite hang out, a very upscale shopping and Dinning place called Santana Row in this place is a Tesla Boutique shop we have one here in Phoenix, but they are not allowed to talk price or lease payments, however, at Santana Row they can, in fact they offer test drives, so far San Jose has the most Tesla's I have ever seen on the road, as my niece says, ""they are nice, but they are just another car now."" We were able to take one for a test drive. we drove a Model S 85, it wasn't fully loaded and MSRP was cough $98K , walking from the store to where the cars are at, the employee (not too sure what her tile was) had the car starting to cool off for us. After 20 minutes of showing us how some of the feature work, the key fob was given to me, and I have to say, what an impressive key fob, it is weighted and looks like the car very impressive. The first thing you notice when you settle into the car is how low it is and how long it is. The car had 21"" wheels so it rode a little on the rough side, and of course my tech geeky niece (she works for Sun Microsystems/Oracle) was playing with the center dash touch screen. As Sweeny said, Tesla could be (it really is) considered one of the best technological advanced companies ever. What can be said about elec motors that no one on this forum hasn't read about it, instead torque, scooting around traffic is not a problem, and if you drive it normal the car just purrs along. The car felt solid, but the closing of the doors didn't have the German feel when closing them. Leases are backed by Wells Fargo, and to lease this particular car it would have ran $1300/m with $7500 out of pocket, or purchase the car $1200/m with 10K down but with the 7500 federal tax credit really only 3K out of pocket. Tesla shows that one can build a pure elect car that is not boring and what the true cost of the car is without being subsidized my the motor-company.  If I could convince myself to spend $1200/m for a car I would get one in a heart beat, I love the design and the 265 miles range is not a problem, and I'm seeing more and more charging stations then ever before.  With the Model X and E coming school and the price dropping, who knows I might have one. The model E is to start at about 45K.  Between San Diego and Phoenix a long highway 8 one can see the charging stations and these are the supercharging station which can charge a Model S in under in 20 minutes half full these are free.. ,"

They have one of the most efficient assembly line of any product ever- they have no massive unions that have ruined some brands- no pensions of workers no longer on the books. The comp needs to pick up game- proof in stock prices- and reviews. If tesla sold a 50k car (with all the tech you crave) it would compete with the 3 series, no doubt- it's expensive because of the tech needed to roll this car.  I have an idea of who's flagging posts but don't really care I find it funny- I feel my ""PL"" is just fine- I find it hard not to look at facts when talking about cars- everyone has an opinion but its worthless without fact.

Content-wise, this (and from an actual cost, not MSRP basis, the Q50, too) ought to be setting the world on fire sales-wise.  Seems tho to not be of too much interest here. Once again, my wife and I looked at this car from a bang for the buck perspective (the TLX Advance V6 w/SH-AWD): What even comes close to the combination of features and alleged capabilities for the money?  Now, still NOT having driven one, perhaps the TLX just seems like an expensive Accord -- but on paper, it would seem not.  Further, it seems far enough UNDER $50K to merit ""our"" attention.  Of course the car magazines are just giving the thing the briefest of ""test-reports"" -- and I would say the reviews from the performance perspective are rather mixed, despite the recognition that there seems to be a lot of car for the MSRP.  What am I, what are we not impressed enough with -- the styling, the tinny sounding doors when slammed?  I have a regret, now that I think about it -- I wish, for a lousy $1,000+ bucks that I would have gotten the torque vectoring diff on my S4 (Audi's SH-AWD).

And no, nit everyone here represents the ""average buyer"" for one of these (the same folks that by 320is and don't order the big engine sport pack models).  I have sat in one a few times, and really liked it. And to me it is attractive. Still haven't driven one, but from showroom testing, not confusing it with an accord, any more than an ES350 vs. a Camry XLE.  My guess is Acura never expected a better than 10% take on the AWD model anyway.  But we shall see.

3510,"September 16, 2014 12:57PM",graphicguy,"One of the things that always confounded me was how you go up the lux car ladder, that things like metallic paint was a costly option. My former S4, which didn't have metallic paint, made it available for a fairly significant extra charge. I think my 335i had metallic black paint that ran somewhere near $600 extra. My TL's? No extra charge. And, Acura puts a very nice paint job on their cars to boot....easily as good as anything else on the market, most times better.  While Acura isn't immune to trying to get people to pay more for leather, all but the base TLX's have leather....and it is a very nice leather....soft, high quality. MB tries to push their vinyl to be as good as leather. From what I can tell, they seem to do a good marketing job on that front.  Was in Costco last night. They always seem to have BMWs in the front as an enticement to use their car buying service. They had a 435i xDrive with the M Sport package....dark metallic grey with red leather interior. It was equipped exactly the way I'd want it. Very nice. But, as I suspected, it was knocking on the door of $60K. For $60K I could negotiate a new Corvette plus a Spark for daily driving duties."

It is amazingly fun to drive and flog around turns at extremely high rates of speed. I feel like I have double the power and control with Quattro and the 3.0 vs. my old FWD 2.0T.  I did find one issue, I'm getting into the music file market (still a CD guy), and I like high resolution ""HD"" music files... like FLAC, but Audi doesn't support anything but MP3 and AAC (the two worst for sound quality). The manual says up to 320 bit rates but in my testing only 256 will work, at least in AAC.  Using ITunes to turn a CD into AIFF, AAC, ALAC, WAV I found only 256 AAC to work. (avoided MP3 all together but that works too; though I didn't test 320 bit rate MP3 yet).  Shame on Audi for not being up to date with FLAC support in a 2014 car.

In regards to sound quality, and this subject has been beaten to death on the forums like Car Audio also people like Harry Kimura (he lives in San Diego and is the grand father of the modern day aftermarket sound competition) if you truly want sound quality in your S4 then contact usdaudio.com/ they are the only people who I would allow to touch my car. Sound Quality comes at a price, and that weigh and space. So if you could get your FLAC files to work, they wouldn't sound all that much different especially driving down the road. If you think your S4 is quite now, you should hear what 200lbs of sound deadening will do to your car. But then it comes at a price, added weight.. Current car audio has come a long way from the days when I work in then car audio industry...

People who compete in the car audio competition spend HOURS making their cars as quite as possible. When they go through the SQ (Sound Quality) check their engines must be running so of course they do not want anything entering the cabin. This is why I said to use a CD instead of the FLAC files. Who remembers DAT (Digital Audio Tape) players poor Panasonic (for the car) thought they were going to be future and make CD's obsolete, the sampling rate was far superior then that of CD's but did not hold the same amount of music as the CD.

Another month, about, has passed with my S4 -- now at 17,300 miles.  And, while I am certain another wild drive in an S6 would have me again tumescent with desire for this $80K super-sedan, it's just too damn fat, too big in the overall scheme of things. What would be really to my tastes, with the benefit of hindsight now, would be a slightly larger S4 -- add about an inch or so to the wheelbase, make it another 3 or 4 db quieter and put the SQ5 engine in it (for the added torque, natch). Open it up just a smidge in size and power -- 333HP and 325 ft/lbs just are about at a point in the marketplace to require a bit of a bump northward.  Here we sit with no new 4's coming until 2016 MY and, if history repeats, no new S4 for at least another year (or two) beyond that.  Now, if someone wanted to provide me with a new S6 for a couple of years at no charge, well, you can be certain I would not re-gift it.  My comments pertaining to my opinion that the S4 will certainly require a power boost to remain competitive are a good example of ""situational velocitization"".

The only cure for this velocitization is to get an A4 2.0T loaner for a day or two, so I can essentially push my quickness and speed reset button, for there is surely no lack of quickness or speed in my S4 -- I've just gotten used to it so much I take it for granted.  Drive it like you live."
3537,"October  4, 2014  1:35AM",sweendogy,"Mark I just had a 15 loaner a4 - and missed every bit go the s4 power for those 2 days. With The new s3 at almost 3oohp I would guess the power bump for the next s4 should be close to 400, but I have not seen any publications on this figure. Maybe that is to high of a figure given the s6 is at 425- that would get us to the Sq5 's 350ish listing. I would love to see a dyno of a stock s4 and a stock sq5 - something tells me they are closer the you think."
3538,"October  6, 2014  4:24PM",markcincinnati," Here's my [generally in violent agreement] thought about that power figure, sween: Ever escalating abilities to get power, coupled with a market that seems to have an endless appetite for more power may well take the next S4 (not the RS4, the S4) to 400 HP. Yet, there may be good reasons NOT to go there. For instance, isn't it true that part of the cost of our auto-insurance is based on HP (not torque, HP)?  If my assumption on that matter is correct, perhaps AoA will lobby for whatever the next lower HP (below 400) is but press for more readily available torque. Economy and emissions, too, would have to be a consideration, no?  The current 3.0T in the S4 puts out a conservative 333HP and 325 pound feet. The beefed up version in the SQ5 adds 21HP (taking it to 354) and 21 pound feet (getting us to 346). The crank is a heavier duty part than in the S4 iteration and apparently the SQ5 engine is ""strong enough"" to be cranked to another like increase without breaking much, if any, of a sweat.  A new model S4 with 375HP and 367 pound feet might just be the Goldilocks answer (at least in the US). This would leave plenty of ""headroom"" for either a blown V8 or an even more tightly tuned V6 (T) to be fitted into an RS4 model. Indeed, based on what is easily do-able these days with plain ol' ""normal"" forced induction (super or turbo), twin-charging (super AND turbo) or other, ""compound induction"" derivatives, I wouldn't be shocked to ""hear-tell"" of an S4 with a 4 cylinder engine of some-kind or another, putting out an easy-peasy 350HP with gobs of low end torque, either.  Program note:  For reasons that would require at least two more paragraphs, I will tell you that I was cruising along at about 67 MPH on I-71 N (north of the I-275 interchange this Saturday PM last). I had the ""need"" to ""punch it"" -- and for the count of 1, 2, 3 floored the S4, cleared the incident, glanced at my digital read-out and found it reading 100. Under the circumstances (light traffic, four lanes heading north, etc), I was simply able to coast down to a relatively legal 68 without the need for the dampers. I realize the S6 seemed to do this exact same thing in what I ""recall"" as 1,2,3 -- the difference is that the S6 did so with practically zero drama. The S4 made all kinds of fun sounds as it made the jump to light speed.   Newer S4's will, due to market conditions, surely come with more grunt than current versions, but for the life of me, I find it difficult to imagine ever being able (or rarely so) to use such power.  1,2,3 -- the thing is like a freakin' sling-shot.  Dizzy with the rush of speed, I leave you saying ""Drive it like you live""!"

3540,"September  9, 2014  7:28PM",andres3,"Got my S4 back today from the body shop, 4 trips total, 68 days total in the shop, and the car is looking and driving great. I think I finally got them to do it ""right."" Still not perfect mind you, but good work that should of been done the first time without repeated return trips to correct deficient work. I just don't think they have enough ""skill"" in their work force Still, for my money I think the ""body shop"" in Ingoldstadt is superior and better. Audi proved to me they do tremendous quality control with this S4 at the factory. They obviously build them to appease guys like me that notice when gaps and panels are off by a MM or two. This last visit was to correct inconsistent gaps with the front hood, lack of buffing/polishing on the front fender and front quarter/fender panels, and 2 bad paint edges at 2 locations on the hood (which was replaced). I drove a new NON SH-AWD 6 cyl. TLX and wasn't impressed at all. The transmission is lazy, why'd they give the 4 cyl the better tranny? Why no exhaust? Why less HP than the outgoing TL SH-AWD? This is your Camry/Prius-like TLX. Perhaps the SH-AWD is another animal? Admittedly, putting the transmission in sport or sport+ mode made it less lazy, but still lacking. I heard the dual clutch still has a torque converter. NO NO NO Acura... no no no. Oh, and the moon roof cover is cardboard covered in vinyl.....compare it to the S4's and you'll believe me that the TLX is an overpriced Accord."
3541,"September  9, 2014  9:07PM",markcincinnati," ===== The number of years before the literal elimination of manual transmissions even from some of the performance stalwarts is damn few. The number of years before the virtual elimination of manual transmissions is even fewer, and some would say that time has already arrived. The truth (my truth, at this point) of the matter is that the 7-speed (and most of the German/European 8-speed versions) is (are) so good, I only miss shifting for sentimental reasons. I don't think I ever was as capable (and certainly not as quick/fast) a shifter as the S-Tronic in my S4. And, the tuning of my wife's 8-speed in her SQ5 is very very close to that same ideal. Sentimentality is a [non-permissible content removed]."

The S3 is just missing something. Well, it's missing several things or doing serveral things not quite right.  I didn't get to really wring it out though as it had 5 miles worth of fuel and went to zero before the test drive was done. All new cars seem to have a ""break-in"" lower power period these days too.

Acura has done a nice job."

3548,"September 11, 2014  9:33PM",ab348,"  In fairness, I am seeing a number of non-professional drive reports from interested parties/potential buyers that are not at all positive, so that weighs heavily against it too. Could Acura have badly missed the mark?"
3549,"September 11, 2014  9:36PM",stickguy,"overall the in depth reviews seem to be positive. as always, especially with individual opinions, you will find people all over the spectrum. Always need to try for yourself!"
3550,"September 12, 2014  1:35AM",sweendogy,Haven't seen a TLX in the wild and after a year finally found one of these....I don't care care what the reviews say acura needs a win- the ILX clearly isn't it - nor is this -

3555,"September 12, 2014  2:59PM",graphicguy,"AB.....from the reviews I've seen, the TLX is been rated from positive, to very positive. You're going to have the ""Fast and Furious"" crowd that laments the omission of ground effects, ""go fast"" spoilers, etc. They still want the ""blaaaaaat"" exhaust cans that you won't get on a TLX. Matter of fact, like a lot of upscale cars, there's no visible exhaust pipes at all on the TLX.  I know it's early, but the numbers suggest Acura has a hit on their hands with. They want to sell 44K of them over 12 mos. They are on track to sell 50K to 60K (probably closer to 50K once the initial flurry slows down).  Something for everyone....4 cyl with DCT, and all wheel steer or 6 cyl. with SH AWD if you want it. As good in the tech dept as anything else on the road, and probably better than most. Performance that's competitive. Value equation that is probably best in class.  Plus, they're about darn near impossible to break, they last a long time, and they don't cost much to maintain or operate.  That's a winner to me."

3558,"September 12, 2014  3:45PM",sweendogy,@ TLX talk- one thing that acura has been missing in sedans - more then anything is LOoks. You can talk about go fast spoilers or whatever BUT reason last TL failed - and make no mistake it did fail (along with RL) is looks. 
3559,"September 12, 2014  3:48PM",stickguy,"The TL I think did take a hit from bad styling. The RL though to me looks just fine. Certainly not exciting or edgy, but conservative and reasonably attractive. Definitely not ugly though. RL was too expensive though, which hurt."
3560,"September 12, 2014  5:38PM",sweendogy,@stickguy - agree - my point was more directed at TL- as you stated I also think the RL was fine in looks. Nothing flashy but hard to buy that when you can pay similar for E class(thus the fail). The new rLx again looks fine but at that range it's tough when you look at comps- haven't seen a TLX yet and won't comment. 
3561,"September 12, 2014  5:51PM",flightnurse," The RL lacks in looks, there is nothing standout about it, it doesn't say Q-Ship, the RL is the top sedan for Acura and it doesn't say that, very understated.."

3563,"September 13, 2014  1:57AM",sweendogy,@benjaminh interesting you are cross shopping an Accord Vs an acura - I remember guys like @graphic_guy‌ on the old TL board loving the 'new' TL only to swap it a short time later. Argument has always been acura is a better car - but no one can argue the construction is accord- and nothing wrong with that
3564,"September 13, 2014  2:55PM",benjaminh,"Although the TLX is based on the Accord, they actually did several significant structural upgrades, included use of even higher grades of steel. Here's some stuff from the Acura press release about that:  http://www.acura.com/PressReleases.aspx  ""High strength steel uses include:  UISBOR – USIBOR is a boron-alloyed steel with an aluminum-silicon coating that protects against oxidation during the heating, forming and hardening process. This high-strength hot-stamp steel is used for the TLX's door opening rings, for 5% of the unit body. (See Safety section for more information.) 980 grade HSS – Used in certain key structural points such as the front edges of the door sills, and in the A-pillars and B-pillars, for 2% of the unit body. 780 grade HSS – Used for most structural load paths for ACE™, including the side sills and forward spars of unit body, for 2% of the unit body. 590 grade HSS – Used for the front frame spars, floor and roof supports, for 35% of the unit body...  Magnesium Steering Hanger Beam Located behind the instrument panel, a 3-piece magnesium steering-hanger beam replaces the 26-piece aluminum and steel unit in the previous TL model. Its purpose is as a structural attachment point for the steering column, pedals and instrument panel, as well as a structural element that helps the passenger cabin retain its shape in certain collisions. This single robust magnesium component makes up 2-percent of the TLX's body weight...."""
3565,"September 14, 2014 10:47PM",stickguy,"OK, stopped at the dealer yesterday, and had a chance to see the TLX in person (did not drive, will do that when I take my TL in for an oil change soon).  they had a couple of black ones on the apron (did not scope out due to pouring rain). But, there was a graphite lustre (same color as my RDX) in the showroom. a V6 FWD. Overall, very nice. Loved the looks. Even the front end was sharp, particularly the headlights. Beak did not offend. the rest of the car had enough curves and design points to be interesting, without feeling overwrought.  Interior, very nice. pretty much shares the dash with the MDX it seems (the RDX and ILX are close to each other too). Well done. Nice, clean dash and very ""Acuraish"" super duper comfy seats. back seat to me was fine. I am 6' with a long torso, and had no problem with leg or head room. Might not be quite as big as the Legacy we drove, but plenty of space for 4 adults. Trunk was acceptable.  not a huge car, but certainly seemed to fit the entry level luxury profile. Performance? Well, the V6 is going to be fast, just based on how fast my RDX is, and the TLX s/b lighter and has more gears.  oh, the ""shifter"" gizmo on the V6 was a bit odd. Simple to use, but just strange. Did not get a chance to see a 4 cyl which has a normal gear shift.  I plan to drive a 4 cyl base car if they have one available in the next week or 2 when I go back down."
3566,"September 14, 2014 10:53PM",stickguy,"oh, and as I typed this, saw about 3-4 different ads for the TLX on the Jets game. So Acura is making a push for selling this car. I think it will do well, assuming it drives as well as the car shows (particularly the interior and feature content).  my one big peeve? They pulled a Hyundai and deleted the spare tire. No run flats (a good thing) but just a can of fix a flat, and a cheap pump. I just refuse to own a car that has no back up plan for a bad tire. Did not explore/question if you could just take out the foam tray under the trunk floor and put a donut in there. Heck, the Legacy not only had a tire, it was on a matching alloy wheel! and per the salesman, was rated for 200 miles."

3568,"September 15, 2014  3:10AM",tlong,"I rented a BMW 328 last week while staying in Las Vegas.  In short, I was particularly underwhelmed by this car. This is coming from somebody who currently drives an '05 TL and previously had a 6 cylinder Audi A4.  The BMW was black and is gorgeous outside. I was a bit surprised at how low the roof is on this car - definitely not a lot of headroom.  Since it's a rental, I'll grant that this was probably a downmarket trim level vehicle. The seats were black and I'm not sure if they were leather or leatherette - I suspect the vinyl as they didn't have a leather smell. The seat bottoms were very flat with almost no bolstering. In general, although the car did have nav, I didn't feel the interior was very upmarket. Seemed pretty middling to me - not as cheap as entry-level cars, but certainly not luxe, either. The trunk is large laterally but is shallow.  The automated nanny behavior had me screaming thoughts of repair costs had I owned this car. The electronic shifter seemed more gimmicky than useful. The auto-engine shutoff was exactly as has been described here - unrefined and jerky on restart. Yes, you can disable it but you need to do that every time you get back in the car.  I thought the steering was a bit numb and vague on-center. The ride was decent but not that quiet. The engine was refined for a 4 but not all that smooth to me. I didn't push the car as I was in traffic, but this car firmly convinced me that I didn't want to pay north of $40K for a 3-series."
3569,"September 16, 2014 11:09AM",circlew,"TLong, did you try the TLX yet? I haven't had interest in the TL since your series was destroyed by the last gen TL but I'd like to get your take to compare to the '05 you have.  I appreciated the reviews from others here as well and did some research on the TLX. Sounds good but haven't seen one live.  I've been pricing the 335is used. I'd never go for the 328 or lower.

3574,"August 29, 2014  2:43AM",andres3," I finally stopped being cheap and hired the collision claims consultants that were recommended to me for a professional unbiased independent diminished value appraisal that finally happened mid-August. It refutes the DV appraisal Mercury (at fault insured's company) paid for where they claimed my car sustained no structural damage (what about pulling an upper right rail isn't structural)? claimed it could be a certified used Audi still (no dealer I talked to seems eager to Certify a $22K+ repair billed S4. Car Max saw bolts spun on the hood and fender and that was enough for them to only offer wholesale price at $37K. They claimed they'd wholesale it, but part of me thinks they'd turn around and list it for $10K more at $47K. Based on their ""outside the ballpark of reality"" DV report, Mercury only offered $1K for DV. They upped it to 1.5K in a fake attempt to settle the claim. I've now sent my demand based on a ""REAL"" report that seems to be in the ball park of reality at $8850 DV amount. Plus the $445 fee and the $2,400 for rental car and insurance deductible expenses. I know they only have a $10K pot to pay out, so I'll settle for $10K total. They just want to delay this claim forever, and their tactics to frustrate me worked. I should of hired this DV Appraisal company from the beginning; I was wasting time without their help. I now have 20 boiler plate letters to refute the predictable excuses and false claims/reasons they can't pay my demand. It's kind of hilarious the letters I received answer and refute some of the BS reasons I've already been given. Each letter gives them 15 days to respond in writing which is more than reasonable. I predict they will offer to split the difference between their $1K DV report and my 8.8K DV report. One of the 20 letters is ready to go on that excuse. Their report is just so inaccurate, and the CarMax appraisal will help show that if need be. Could take 4 to 5 more letters going back and forth before I get paid, or worst case scenario, I have to take them to small claims court for $10K. The thing is these letters help build a ""bad faith lawsuit/claim"" if they refuse to pay up, so maybe a lawyer would take my case at that point. No lawyers seemed interested in talking to me over a potential $15K property damage claim. Next time someone hits me my neck and back is going to hurt a lot."

3581,"September  8, 2014  8:08PM",markcincinnati,"When I pulled up to the sidewalk and parked in the No Parking zone, the boys’ bicycles were on their kick stands under the porte cochère at the back of the public library where the night drop off for books and, in my case, DVD’s is located. The library wouldn’t be open for more than an hour, so I assumed the boys were just there to get out of the hot morning sun. I put the DVD’s into the slot, nodded at the boys and turned around heading back to my idling car. Just about when I got to the driver’s door, one of the boys said “How much did that [car] cost?” I replied, “How much do you think?” The young man and his friend yelled back in unison, “A lot!” I told them it cost about $57,000, and I heard oo’s and ah’s in response. I drove off, giving them a quick honk and a wave. What’s the point? The point is, I’ve been thinking, saying and writing about what I assumed is the pending death of the automobile as most of us here know and love it. I’ve been of that opinion because it seems to me that virtually anyone under the age of 35 (or maybe under-30) seems as if they could care less about cars beyond them being appliances or means to get from point-to-point. These “young people” wouldn’t or couldn’t talk about cars if you threatened them with pain and death, and wouldn’t even bother to feign interest to win the new not-yet-released iPhone 6, so little interest do these folks seem to have in cars. These two young men gave me hope! Now, I’ll bet when you and I were in our formative (‘tween through teen-age) years, we had but several topics we cared to opine about: Cars, Girls [or boys] and Sex. I my case, I was a budding audiophile, too, which kind of rounded out the whole emerging nerd stereotype. Had there been personal computers (of any stripe) or video games available (it was the early to mid-60’s and such tech had not yet been introduced to the mainstream market), I most certainly would’ve been into them; but instead I was into “stereo” in addition to cars, girls and sex (talking about sex, not actually having it, of course). So when I was with my buds, the topic was often the “cars we were gonna be driving” as soon as we turned 16. We were dreamers, of course – we, then, were the kids sitting at the library entrance (where else?) watching the guy drive up in his new 1965 Bonneville pillar-less four-door painted in dark blue metallic with a ton of chrome accents and shiny chrome hub-caps and big ol’ tires (white walls, of course). “Hey mister, how much did that thing cost?” The reply, at the time, was “About $4,000,” and of course we then obliged by making the same oo and ah sounds like the ones I heard the other morning. My overarching point to this erudite group of auto enthusiasts here at Edmunds is that I believe we are pretty much smitten with cars and everything to do with them – but that we’re also mostly predisposed to acquire one of these Premium (or near-premium) Class cars based on history, loyalty or perhaps even looks. I would submit if you’ve had more than one representative of the same brand (back to back), that your next car is perhaps pre-ordained to come from that manufacturer. Loyalty to a brand is – along with several other characteristics – another sign that you are passionate about cars. You’ve come to identify yourself with BMW’s (a quite common occurrence here in Cincinnati) – you are a “BMW guy”. My friend, now President of his second software company had an Acura when I met him. In our times in the car often driving from Cincinnati to Chicago or to Bowling Green (KY), he would go on and on about what I’m convinced must be the best car in the world – at least he certainly thought so: the BMW M5. This guy was about 10-years my junior. Thankfully he didn’t have to keep the Acura long – so less than a year after I met him he leased his first (of many) BMW’s – a 3-series. Followed by a 5, then a 7 then one of the “Z” car convertibles (he called that one Penis). I submit that most of us here are (or want to be) “XXX” guys (intended to be gender neutral, don’t you know). You’re a Mercedes maven, you’re a BMW bigot and I’m an Audi aficionado. No matter what “empirical” data is brought to bear, you’re sure your new IS 350 F-Sport is superior to that guy’s BMW 328 – after all, Car & Driver says so; and, you just know you can run circles around the Bimmer’s 4-cylinder, turbo and all. So it is with the foreknowledge that no matter how much evidence I can produce to the contrary, you will remain steadfast that your own sagacity has been validated and put on display for all to see by your choice of the latest and greatest Volvo S60 (or whatever). So where does that leave us? With hope, I hope. The upcoming generation still needs to ratchet up their passion for all things automotive – or we could be doomed to forever being but passengers in our autonomous vehicles. But, I think there is some evidence, not much, but a little, that there are kids who are just as interested in cars as they are video games, social media (and, hopefully, sex). There may be some hope, too, that those of “us” who may not as of yet yet been inculcated by a Brand of automobile, may find our personal automotive archetype and to coin a phrase, “Live long and prosper.” I’ll close by saying this: While I still remain convinced that the Audi S4 is the best representative of the Entry-level Luxury Performance Sedan (and for the money it damn well ought to be), I must say, after having visited the Acura dealer to “See what’s new,” that the new TLX SH-AWD in Advance trim (the one with the 6-cylinder), ought to be this category’s leader if “price” (MSRP) is factored in. If you haven’t checked out this exact configuration (I can’t offer the same praise for the lesser TLX’s), I urge you to do so before you spend one dime on a new ELLPS car – this thing (the 2015, to be clear) is IMPRESSIVE! ""Cut me some slack, Jack! Chump don' want no help, chump don't GET da help!"""

3596,"September  9, 2014  3:36PM",markcincinnati,"Another One Bites the Dust This is gettin' serious now: ""Nissan Plans to Make Autonomous Driving Common by 2016"" -- Motor Trend, October 2014; Pg - 26 You know what Pogo said: ""We have met the enemy and he is us."" Well ""us"" -- and we know who we are -- killed (or at least put it on its death-bed) the stick shift. Now, of course that's only partially true -- at least if you even a tiny bit agree that the DSG (aka PDK) dual clutch 'automatic manual' transmission is (and I hate to say this) equal to or better than the best manual transmissions ever made. But so few of ""us"" actually have these marvelous inventions -- and, I'll wager, the number of folks with the excellent 8-speed automatics available is also still somewhat small. I can only sort of forgive YOU and hold my head up high with righteous indignation: Because god knows my wife and I did our parts to preserve the manual transmissions going so far as to custom order nearly 2-and-a-half-dozen German cars with stick shifts since 1977 (we finally quit this practice out of the sheer futility of the act when we realized that [most of] the rest of YOU -- overwhelmingly -- had given up on stick shifts years earlier). And, my wife was appalled to read some of lame excuses, most of them blaming ""the wife"" for her inability to pilot a car with a stick shift. Of course, there is always that nagging feeling that the mobile phone also played a big part in killing the stick shift; even today it seems I don't have enough digits to count the number of cars I see being driven down the road with the driver holding a cell phone to his or her ear. So what? I forgot to mention the ""phones in the ear"" (thus requiring one free hand) I am counting are for the drivers' of cars that I know have Bluetooth! These drivers should be forced to ride the bus for one-full-year or pay a 5-figure fine (or both). This morning, in fact, I saw a woman (phone in ear) in a very young Maserati (with temp tags it was so new) pulling into Starbucks. I could only wonder if she was going to attempt to be on the phone and drink coffee all the while driving in rush hour traffic here in River City. The point? Qwit yur complainin', for the Market has spoken. But this latest outrage -- autonomous driving (by 2016 no less) -- is, some will say, both inevitable and welcome. Perhaps. It is also inevitable that we will -- eventually -- run out of fossil fuel. But we're talking decades and decades if you believe many of the scholarly studies from think tanks like the Rand Corporation to name one. Mean time, WHO (among us) is asking for self-driving cars? I'd rather pay more taxes (and I can't believe I said that) if some of them could be earmarked for public transportation infrastructure improvements and additions. A one-person (or 4 person) public transportation vehicle (manifested in the form of a self-driving passenger vehicle), is not something I want to sign up for. On the other hand, I do want driver aids: laser headlights, night-vision, ""city safety"", all around-view cameras, rear cross traffic alerts -- even automatic cruise control for those 100+ mile stints behind the wheel that are part of my weekly routine trips between Cincinnati and Columbus or Cincinnati and Louisville or Indianapolis. I want a connected car (better even than that which is in my 2014 S4: ""Audi Connect""), but I still want to press the pedals (most of the time, anyway) and turn the steering wheel myself. I am [now, happily] resigned to allowing my dual-clutch 7-speed automatic manual transmission to do the rowing for me, but I am far, far, far from wanting my car to drive itself. Indeed, I'm mostly sure I don't even want the thing to park itself, thank you very much. The only good news in the Nissan announcements (if you can call it ""good"") is that Nissan claims they will NOT ELIMINATE the need for human interaction (like some competitors -- gulp). ""There is no need to sally forth, for it remains true that those things which make us human are, curiously enough, always close at hand. Resolve then, that on this very ground, with small flags waving and tinny blast on tiny trumpets, we shall meet the enemy, and not only may he be ours, he may be us."" Drive it like you live -- but do drive it yourself."

Gas is too expensive to entertain the thought of settling for the available 6-speed manual S4 which is still available (probably only by special order).

3600,"August 26, 2014  3:53PM",robr2," It's two-fold. First, it's safer to navigate the Pandora app through the vehicle's infotainment center than it is to try and control it through your phone. Voice controls and steering wheel controls reduce the need to pick up the phone to use Pandora. Second, it's a marketing push. With Pandora in the infotainment system like Sirius/XM and terrestrial radio, you are more prone to use it which shows greater users/ratings and allowing them to sell higher priced advertising. I have Pandora on my phone and never use it in the car. It's too much of a pain to use the phone while driving a stick shift in the city."
3601,"August 26, 2014  3:57PM",markcincinnati,"Most of the technologies that surprise and sometimes shock me for coming to the party so late are very inexpensive (and have been for some time). I can actually understand why ABS took a long time to ""trickle"" down. But, according to so many ""experts"" the single most valuable technology to come along is/was the electronic stability program (ESP) -- or just stability control. Once ABS is in place (my first car with it was built in 1986) adding ESP is relatively inexpensive. Yet it took perhaps 15 years to get it into ""mainstream"" cars even though it had been proven to be a life saver and a money saver since it was almost magical in its ability to help a driver avoid an unwanted crash (as if there are ""wanted"" crashes, eh?). Same with the backup camera -- cheap to implement and very valuable. Wait a minute, now I remember my dealer telling me that ESP was a $550 option for a couple of years on Audi products and that sunroofs were $1,250 (and not actually used that much), but that people would almost always opt for the sunroof they'd use twice a year and omit the ESP charge proclaiming ""It's just an electronic nanny, I don't need it."" In short, @m6user and @flightnurse: Point taken! ?'s Has Congress finally passed the ""mandatory"" back-up camera bill they've been promising? Oh, btw, I do see an abundance of folks driving cars (that I know have bluetooth) with phones pressed against their heads, all while driving one-handed or with their heads cocked to keep the phone from falling. Why wouldn't you use bluetooth if you had it? Inquiring, confused minds want to know."
3602,"August 26, 2014  4:21PM",robr2," Yes. The requirement was supposed to be implemented by 2011. But the DOT filed for extensions - presumably on the behest of industry. Now all vehicles under 10,000 lbs. built after May 1, 2018 must be equipped with a back up camera."

The light at the end of the tunnel now appears NOT to be an on-coming train! Woo Woo. Back to cars! Adding a backup camera would cost something, sure, I get THAT -- but the cost would be passed on to the consumer and probably with at least a penny profit. I know it may sound like blasphemy, but I'm really curious about the new 2015 Genesis 4-door sedan. Priced here in the ELLPS pack, certainly doing a great cover as an ELLPS (wishing they were, I assume, an LPS, which won't be too much of a stretch over the next few years, I'd imagine). If I thought I could count on any of y'all to start mass quantities of test-drives, I'd pass on doing that, at this time. My wife and I must be outliers -- test driving is a serious hobby for us; and it is free, and about every 36 months we drop about $100K or more on a couple of new cars, and the dealer group we use to take our test drive adventures knows it, so there's always a willingness to let us go out and explore. Seems like a decent number of folks here probably do the same thing in terms of being in the market -- but y'all (and I grant I could be wrong) don't seem to be taking out the latest and greatest to see what's what. Think of it this way -- a new restaurant comes to town; I'm assuming most (51%) folks here eat out -- A LOT -- well you probably give the new eatery a go. The characteristics of the ELLPS and LPS ""buyers"" is (I've assumed with the data points y'all share here) would seem to indicate you're -- most of you anyway -- auto mavens (experts or connoisseurs). You like to ""dine"" (drive) the new restaurant (auto). True dat? I also assume y'all subscribe to at least two of the ""big"" car magazines and devour them both in print and on-line. Well the challenge I'll throw out -- and there is no prize for winning -- is to get into the new cars and drive them, then sign on here and tell us a story, whet our appetites for all things automotive (or at least ELLPS and/or near-LPS). Make the others here -- force or compel the rest of us -- HAVE to take out the car you drove to experience it for yourselves. Even if it's not an Audi."

3608,"August 27, 2014  1:30AM",markcincinnati,"This is a big tent, we do have room for Neo-Luddites -- and smart alecs (like me). I must have something wrong with me -- for I use my nav system every day, every single day. I leave for work in the AM and I punch up my nav system, set the scale to 4 miles, which is enough to capture two Interstate highways that I may have to travel. Wait 5 seconds. The screen paints a series of red, yellow or green outlines along either the north/south or east/west route that I must travel to get from sub-urban Cincinnati to the CBD (where I need to be). If I see too much red painted on the Interstates (275 or 71), I know things are gonna be s=l=o=w so I take a secondary road route -- and I often try multiple routes and ask the navi lady to help me. I also ask the system to give me an approximate arrival time. Hell, I play with all this stuff and wish there was more tech to assist me in my journey. To each his / her own -- but the thing is, increasingly, the buyers of ELLPS's and LPS's take for granted that their vehicles will come with nav and a lot of other driver aids. I was in a meeting in Lexington KY (80 miles south of Cincinnati) the other day -- we were discussing an upcoming meeting and the client made the assumption that I would just input the address into the car's nav system (he knew not anything about my car), so he didn't give me directions, he just gave me the street and number of the destination to plug into my nav. A Garmin certainly works fine, folks often say they are superior to the factory systems (other than not being integrated with the rest of the car's ""avionics"".) It is just a preference (of mine) to have everything built in. Hence my frequent close: Drive it like YOU live. I submit, however, that all of this tech will soon, soon, soon be standard and that there will be a bunch of new tech none of us have even imagined, yet. Besides, I wouldn't pull over and ask for directions or attempt to use a map, if threatened with pain and death."
3609,"August 27, 2014  2:11AM",justg0,"I use Navi too - but not the factory installed as they get outdated and are not as good as Google Maps. Google Maps on my Android device automatically picks the best route for me out of the possible 3 options I have to work based on the traffic conditions. And it keeps recomputing in realtime as I am driving. It tells me if alternate routes will be X minutes faster or slower. Maps are always up-to-date. It has information of road closures, accidents, everything I need. And since it is on my phone or my computer (same Google maps), I can lookup the route beforehand to plan ahead and I see the same route in my car. With Ok Google Now, I rarely need to type in the address or destination. The voice recognition is pretty good and I can lookup and navigate to addresses and destinations. The phone connects via Bluetooth so all the voice turn-by-turn directions are played via the car speaker system. If I have music playing (again via bluetooth audio), it will pause the music to speak out the directions. And all of this is Free. I don't think I can every go back to factory installed navi."

In a previous life I was self-employed (owner-operator driving a KW), but for the 30+ years since I've been working for ""the man"" in the form of an international conglomerate. I balance my 401K once or twice a year and my finances look pretty good, compared to the high-flyers over the years. I enjoy driving more than I do cars (in the art form, keep them polished but never dirve them sense), and my work allows me to do so, at their expense. I could have retired three years ago and continued to draw as much money as I do now, but I've chosen to continue to work. This puts more into the 401(K), as opposed to taking it out, and keeps me entertained.

They were recently bought by google (a yr ago)- it uses real time driver info from users and the reporting is via users. Gives info on traffic, weather, potholes and best of all Cop locations. It reroutes on the fly- like if there is an accident 2 exits away it will tell me to get off and take service streets - wicked smart.

The inherent risk (and the dealers who know me, know this) is that I fall in love with something. Before you know it, out comes the check book. So, I try to temper what I drive, and when. If property taxes are due, that's a good time to test drive. I'm less likely to pull out the checkbook (which would be severely depleted at that time. I did look at the new '15 C300 at my nearby Benz dealer. My sister bought a car there ('14 C350). Nice interior. Dealer wanted to go for a spin. I said ""no"". Pretty inside. But, $50K?

3617,"August 27, 2014  4:11PM",robr2,"Mass DOT has implemented a system similar to Waze on major highways. Starting in 2012, the state set up Bluetooth readers and message boards. It's called Go Time. They anonymously read Bluetooth devices in your car and measure when you get to other readers to estimate how much time it is between set points. That information is sent to the message boards and to an app called RTTM. And it does all that without any interaction from the user or Waze's silly icons. One can use the message boards to plan your drive or check the RTTM app on your phone. I'd like to see something like this expanded to nav systems."

So it's great when you are already sitting in traffic and it tells you it's 30 mins to go another 10 miles,  WaZe uses users speed and not just interactions - but the interactions are what make it better- ""Police Ahead"" helps and will never be integrated with MassDot"

Via Bluetooth, I can already use my iPhone's phone functions. I can also get the spoken Buetooth directions through the TL's sound system via maps. I can ask Siri questions and get answers via Siri connected to bluetooth. So, if they're planning even more integration (say, just having a screen where an iPhone displays it's maps and bluetooth where the directions can be heard), I'm thinking onboard Nav systems may be a thing of the past."

3624,"August 27, 2014  9:29PM",markcincinnati,"I think virtually the entire in-car ""avionics"" or ""carvionics"" should be able to be updated by BlueTooth streaming from (why not) a smart phone. New features and functions could be loaded into the dash's brain just like an app can be downloaded into your smartphone. Certain things, I'm sure, would require hardware upgrades, but heck, make everything a module (as if it isn't already in a lot of cases) that could be plucked out like a radio head unit and replaced with new technology. And, why not make things at least one, if not more generations backwardly compatible (with some loss of functionality). Right now I want to update (replace actually) that piece of crap Audi Connect ""hardware"" that apparently, forces me to have but ONE choice, other than to go without -- T-Mobile. I go less than 5 miles and the connection drops to 2G, which totally kills Google Maps and the eye in the sky-view on the screen. Even 3G isn't all that great. Yet, right there, on the showroom floor is an A3 with 4G LTE -- which is pretty much like being there (and the carrier is AT&T which works about 98% of the time compared with T-Mobile's 70% of the time.) There must be a ""module"" under the dash that is nothing more than a ""smart phone"" without the phone case. Or, why not allow the ""phone"" to be ""unlocked"" and allow, via software, me to use another, more reliable carrier. Heck, for all I know T-Mobile is great (just not in Ohio), elsewhere. Update-able tech, that's what's next -- or at least it should be. Of course, I think EVERYTHING should be standard on the car as it comes from the factory. Then, if you want the option, you pay for it -- you don't get rid of the car. This could even be done for many engine performance enhancements -- base cars comes with 200HP and 200 ft/lbs of torque. Pay the man (the dealer) to turn on the next level up the performance ladder and the engine now cranks out 250HP and 275 ft/lbs., etc etc. I'm not suggesting a basic BMW 3-series come to market equipped with a software hobbled M3 powerplant -- awaiting someone to pay for the upgrade to have the secret code entered. More like what IBM does with some of their hardware that can be upgraded for the end of month processing -- for a fee and then returned to normal for the routine daily processing of data."
3625,"August 28, 2014  2:06AM",andys120,"Our Epic ELLPC Road Trip My wife and I recently completed an extensive motor tour of the Intermountain West in our 2001 BMW 330 Ci Cabriolet. Sometimes in this topic we lose sight of the fact that these cars aren't just about high tech features and luxury appointments, they're about enjoying driving . I thought I'd give you some impressions about what it's like to take one of these ELLP cars on an extensive road trip. I'm not going to give you a travelogue of what we saw and did but talk about the journey, which, if you love to drive, is as important as the destinations. I'm well aware that the convertible version of the Three Series isn't the sort of vehicle most would choose for such a trip, in fact the default choice for such long-distance touring is a motor home/RV or Fifth-wheel trailer. I understand the appeal of such vehicles but pros get paid good money for driving large heavy vehicles because driving them is a chore, at least IMO. If you love driving and haven't driven in the Far West you should put it on your bucket list. You can really drive out there, speed limits are high and traffic enforcement is light. The roads (with some notable exceptions*) are in beautiful shape and even the Interstates have dramatic curves, steep grades (up to 7%!) and the most spectacular scenery you'll see anywhere. Our 14 year old Bimmer performed beautifully without any problems other than a healthy appetite for 91 Octane (we averaged 28 MPG) and took to the highway as an autobahn-bred car should. We always had more than enough power and brakes to handle anything and the sublime steering made every mile a pleasure. The major drawback of course was the small size, it wouldn't be suitable for more than two on such a long trip. We took advantage of the feature that allows one to flip away the recess where the top goes when it's down which greatly increased luggage space but robbed us of the ability to cruise topless until had we offloaded the bags. I've been a convertible guy for a long time but I wouldn't care to go more than two or three hours w the top lowered anyway. Thanks to the well-designed top, the Three-er Cabrio makes a very nice Grand Touring coupe w the top in place . After 20 days, 4500 miles and 8 states (AZ/UT/ID/OR/MT/WY/NV) we arrived home tired but satisfied after a great drive in a wonderful car. *Western roads are generally in fine shape with a couple of notable exceptions (mostly in Montana and I-40 in Western AZ is surprisingly bad give the state's rep for good roads) but they are littered with ""Road Alligators"", shreds of truck tires, one of which tore up the lower front grille and left side fog light. This is surprising in light of the proliferation of truck inspection stations. Don't they ever notice that the tires on these big rigs are crap?"

3627,"August 28, 2014  5:31AM",andres3,"I think the back up camera and the Navigation are tied together with the Audi S4, so it's like $3K to get the two features. NO thank you. I know a guy with a 2011 S4 and he was using his back up camera while backing up and it caused him to wreck his side mirror housing on the right side. The problem is the screen doesn't show your sides, only the rear. I forced my insurance to replace the aluminum side mirror housing due to a chip from my accident in March. I now know why they ignored the small chip originally, as the part is $500 and nearly $600 installed. My money was better spent getting the 3.0T, the S-Tronic DSG, the Sport Diff, and the Nappa Leather than on Navigation or backup cameras. Some people don't want to spend $50K, let alone MORE THAN $50K to get a great vehicle. P.S. You have to turn off the ESC to use launch control."
3628,"August 28, 2014  3:37PM",sweendogy,@andres3‌ - I think the back up camera plus beeping things are a great help in my s4 - but the camera and the beeps are just an aid in backing up. Sorry to hear about the friends situation but hard to blame a camera for user error. To each is own on optioning a car but cameras should and will be standard on all cars- fact is they help and the govt has taken notice and I'm sure insurance companies are going to be happier too.

3631,"August 19, 2014  8:13PM",kyfdx," Not a lawyer or even an expert, but I'll disagree. It's just a used car. The only thing Honda has to do with it, is the extended warranty.

The TQ is everpresent and always available – offering instant thrust any time, even in higher gears. One of my top ‘requirements’. [ I am a Torque Addict. ] The 2.0L 4 cylinder [ highly boosted ] engine feels and sounds much smoother than the [ not nearly as highly boosted ] 2.0L in my 2013 GTI. Sounds, and feels and pulls ‘expensive’. Pulled cleanly and smoothly from low RPM and sounded eager to run all the way to the red line. I believe the C+D 12.9 sec. quarter mile result. [ Horsepower 292 @ 5,400–6,200 rpm Torque 280 lb-ft @ 1,900–5,300 rpm ] The 6 speed DCT is very responsive and the shifts, both up and down are accomplished very quickly and with no interruption in power flow. RPM match on downshifts is flawless. The paddles are active at all times, another of my requirements. I spent several minutes looking over the interior, while my sales contact was on a call. Everything = switchgear, surfaces, displays, etc. looked and felt of appropriately high quality. The seats were immediately comfortable and felt very supportive. They have the adjustable thigh support that I like. The front center armrest is adjustable up / down & fore / aft. A nice touch that I appreciate. The handling, on several deserted curves, was quite confidence inspiring. No feel of front heavy weight distribution. The steering works well, for me. I was pleasantly surprised by the ride, given that this did not have the Audi Mag Ride, nor the 19” wheels & tires than are required with that option. It handled the occasionally broken and deteriorating sections of asphalt and concrete pavement I encountered very well, indeed. This could save me $1,500! Overall, I was very impressed – and [ pending a longer test drive ] this has been added to my ‘short list’ of possible next car to purchase or lease. That list includes the BMW M235i. One minor complaint – the interior rear view mirror is oddly small & oval shaped? That’s about it, for me. = Ray Very enjoyably surprised & pleased with this Audi sport sedan . . ."

I was thumbing through the June 2013 copy of the British magazine CAR and it contained a very positive review of the new S3. That review was followed by a comparison of the S3 to the Mk7 GTI with the Performance Pack(an extra 10 hp, better brakes, and an electronically controlled mechanical limited slip diff). The same guy(Ben Pulman) wrote both articles and he concluded that aside from the S3 being @1.5 seconds quicker in the 0-62 mph sprint, the GTI was essentially the equal of the S3 in all but the worst road conditions. Given the price differential, he would ""...take the GTI every time."" In my case, it's rather academic, as I already have a FWD hot hatch with a true limited slip for semi-pro levels of hooning and I'm not at all interested in an AWD track toy, but I still found the articles to be illuminating."
3650,"August 23, 2014  3:53PM",markcincinnati,"Just had the 15,000 mile service on my '14 S4 S-Tronic. While in, I also had the tires rotated and was comp'd a set of $69 wiper-blades, causing the computer to spit out the admonition that these freebies were a one-time deal. The service manager's good will was somewhat offset by the wag of the computer's finger. I had no expectation of free wipers, but appreciate them, since I replace them every 15K as a matter of routine. Typical to the Audi powerplants, I am now enjoying the 10,000+ mile break in surge of power. The engine that keeps on giving now even shows 30 or more MPG's from time-to-time, beating my 2009 2.0T A4 (which had the 6-speed Tiptronic.) After driving the S6 recently, I am still smitten -- were $'s no object. But, if you're considering a $55K+ ELLPS, you owe it to yourself to drive one of these -- other's may come close, but -- for the money -- this is THE one to beat. Of course this is certified, 100% bias-free fact based commentary. Couple of program notes if you get serious about a 2015 S4: If leasing go Premium+ If buying at least consider Prestige Get the full-leather seating Get the B&O sound-system Get MMI Plus Get Audi-side assist Consider Audi-sport differential if you ever like to really carve into curves Debate the merits of sticking with the 18"" wheels -- even they come with 40Series tires -- ride improves, tires cost less, last longer -- and if you axe me, the OEM tires aren't the best anyway, so you'll want to consider replacing them. Of course the 19"" wheels sure are purty. The trim on the dash, doors etc, can be had in 3 flavors, look at examples of each, then decide. Paint is expensive -- if on a budget (what am I saying) get one of the free colors. The video reviews and Motor Trend says 0-60 4.4 sec. The S3 may equal it, but there are several reviews all over the web that claim the S4 is quciker than Audis published claims. The Audi Connect is 3G -- it sucks (if it is T-Mobile) -- great concept, crappy execution. Objectively this is the best you can get, if you don't want to spend more. If you want something for less $ that will satisfy your needs for speeds, etc, consider the Acura TLX V6 w/SH-AWD and in Advance trim -- consider it a bargain S4, sort of.

3657,"August 26, 2014  2:27PM",markcincinnati,"Personal Preference Speaking Here: I do I do I do really like the A6 family (espcially the S6) -- the current A6 is, IMNSHO, a looker from the outside and MOSTLY on the inside. A few years ago, pre-widespread implementation of nav systems in the LPS and ELLPS classes, Pioneer electronics offered a replacement head-unit for many cars, Audi being among them. The thing looked pretty standard, seemed to fit in nicely with the rest of the car (this was back in the days when Audi cars came with Blaupunkt head-unit systems), at least as nicely as the Audi OEM units. The Pioneer solution included sat nav. The way it worked was to seemingly eject a rectangular panel horizontally and then articulate the panel (the screen), by 90 degrees. At the time, I thought, ""Gawd that looks soo after-market"" -- they (meaning Audi) need to inegrate the navi screen into the dash, not copy this fugly looking contraption. Once Audi abandoned the very small navi screen between the tach and speedo and went with a 7"" widescreen aspect ratio built into the dash, I thought we'd taken a big step forward in interior design. BTW, why buy one of these $50K cars without navi, etc and smack a Tom Tom or Garmin unit onto a patch of Velcro every-time you get in the car? Or even more inexplicable, why buy one of these high-buck cars without nav and then spend a king or queen's ransom to retro-fit the OEM nav system (literally for double the cost of getting it on the car in the first place)? Virtually all the car-buff magazines agreed -- for years and years -- ""No one does interiors better than Audi."" I got my 2005 A6 with all options, meaning the built in screen was present and accounted for, acting as my navi screen, as well as radio screen, telephone screen, etc etc etc. As an aside -- I've had BlueTooth for 10+ years and I saw a Honda commercial last night on TV where you'da thunk the new 2015 Honda Civic ""now with bluetooth"" was making some cutting edge revelation. What's that about? I mean, seriously, I've had bluetooth for over 10-years and it is being touted as some great new feature that should make you want to consider a new Honda ""as if"" the thing is a leader in Automotive Electronics. My 2009 A4 had an upgraded and improved version of the 2005 A6 dash and, of course, added a back-up camera (which didn't come to the A6 until the 2006 model year). Don't get me started again on Honda's cutting-edge inclusion of a back up camera on a 2015 car ""as if"" it was the second coming! Then, I start looking at the new A6's that came into the showroom in 2012 and they had that damn Pioneer aftermarket screen protruding out and up EVERY time you started the car. The salesperson says ""OK, if you don't like it, you can push a button to keep it hidden."" Sure you can, but you'll miss radio info, telephone info and also other key information that is displayed and is to be acted upon from time to time -- so, you can't really keep that stick-em-up screen hidden since it is one of your key components for management of some of the cars systems. That damn pop-up aftermarket looking thing was/is one of my pet peeves about the then (2012) current CTS -- but at least Cadillac had some of the data visible when the screen was in its retracted position. It looks even worse on the A3, since the dash is soo plain (barren from the middle to the passenger side, really.) The Macan, TODAY, has taken over for the best NEW dash, if you axe me. Audi needs to get rid of that protuberance in the A6 and A3 right away, like NOW. The A4 and A5 (for 2015) dash may be a bit dated, but it is crisp and clean compared to what seems to pass these days as modernistic. Audi, look at the Macan's dash from the perspective of a front seat occupant -- that should be YOUR dash-look. ""You cursed brat! Look what you've done! I'm melting! melting! Oh, what a world! What a world ..."" What time is it now? Oh who cares -- it must be 5 o'clock SOMEWHERE. Anyone care to join me? Cheers and beers."

First off audi interiors are amazing and this a6 was extra cushie compared to my s4 with summer slicks. Nice highway cruiser - but a bit of a boat in the turns. Pickup from the 3.0 smooth but not dramatic even in dynamic mode. Infact it made me wonder how slow or unsporty the 2.0 would be- as the car is huge. I drove the car for approx 20 miles - and have to say if I was maybe 10-15 years older it would be my cup of tee but not at this juncture.  Other observations - sat in an A3, while the doors seemed a little tinnie the overall car was pretty impressive and I would certainly take a look at this car if considering. The layout is simple and it seems like a great commuter car in 2.0 form. The trunk also huge for a compact.  S6 - saw one in blacked out (optic pack?) form - so attractive.

If he simply bought back every car that people felt was a lemon, he'd be out of a job very quickly. Besides, his customer is the dealer not the consumer. IIRC, wasn't yours bought out of the offending rep's territory? In that case, the buyback would come out of his budget and his district didn't get credit for the original sale. Once you went to the original dealer, everything was handled."
3680,"August 18, 2014  1:11PM",graphicguy," Robr2....yes, all true. Bought it outside the servicing dealers' territory. Bought in Chicago....serviced in Cincinnati. I saved $4K on the car by doing that. Plus, the selling dealer went to great legnths explaining to me how Audi values me as a customer, and that warranty work/service would gladly be done at an Audi dealer in the country. I've bought enough cars to understand what happened. You're probably right. There was a rep who was operating with the idea that the car was bought outside his territory (not totally sure about that though, given Audi has a Central Region based out of Chicago...not sure if OH is included in that). However, that's a case of not seeing the forrest for the trees. They acknowledged there was a problem. They said Audi had a fix. They never did, or if they did, it didn't work. The local dealerships (Audi recommended I try both) diagnosed it the same way. Both said it was a problem. No one could or would fix it. There were other issues with the car, however....not just the Quattro binding. At one point, the Audi Customer Service Rep even said that I was having it serviced at a dealer that I didn't buy it from, and that could be an issue. I've always thought that, but that's the first time I heard an actual manufacturer's representative admit it. That said, I would imagine this does happen. There has to be a procedure to account for this....some sort of a paper trail to account for something like this. So, you go to Audi, with them telling you they don't care where you buy their cars, as long as you buy them. But, in reality, at least in my case, unless you buy it from the dealership closest to you, geographically, you might have some issues getting the car fixed. That must have been in their fine print somewhere that I missed. Don't get me wrong. Not taking it out on you, Robr2. You've brought up a lot of bad feelings I had with the brand, their dealerships, etc from when they'd rather fight with me than focus their energies on fixing my S4. They had an opportunity to keep/save a customer. They made a concious decision to act like jerks instead."

After 250 miles it started leaking fluids, I opened the hood and found a piece of lower bumper lodged in the engine well- along with a poorly done overspray underneath some plastic bits. At 3 weeks of ownership I took it to my local dealer which is 200 miles from where I bought it. They confirmed my worse fears that the car was in a major frontal and should never has been given the honda certified status- Honda was no help said but would investigate, I could not have my family in this car and promptly drove the 200 miles- with documentation from the other dealer- a detailed letter from my lawyer with threat to sue- my detailed expenses incurred -homework done on new model, honda reference numbers on said case and best of all my cop buddy friend (to restrain me) . After 2 hours and almost a black eye I walked out my total cost for used car including 1k for said expenses- I also was given a heavily discounted new car which we have had now for 3 years and runs like a top.

3691,"August 12, 2014  9:12PM",markcincinnati,"My point regarding the new A3/S3 (which I have not driven, but have sat in) is that it will ""force"" the A4/S4 to move upscale in terms of luxury and it will also get more power so that the S3 will not be quicker than an S4. The basis for my comments is the new C&D article where C&D says the S3 makes the S4 irrelevant or something akin to that. I have not seen the S3 yet -- but the A3 would probably receive the same comments -- this time aimed at the A4 -- from the author of the C&D piece on the S3. If you accept that as having some truth to it, it would seem that Audi will be forced to do something to keep the A3/S3 from siphoning off customers from the A4/S4. Many folks buy/lease these cars and only the front seats see much adult duty -- the rear seats may be used by an adult, but probably only rarely. I think the A4/S4 is a bit cramped in the back seat -- so the A3, of course, must be quite cramped. But, who cares if 95% of the time it is a driver and maybe a front seat passenger. Even those who take their colleagues to lunch probably would find no issue with the A3 for the often short drive from the office to the lunch wagon. What could the A4/S4 do -- add performance and/or add luxury -- and being that you're Audi, you would probably err on the side of adding lux first, performance second (my point about the S6 is that it is a far more ""muted"" sporting vehicle, emphasizing luxury first -- even though it IS a screamer performance wise.) The 2016 A4 line will -- if history repeats -- not offer up an S4, rather that will come in MY 2017. But, even the A4 vs the A3 will have the A4 needing to be different enough from the A3 to justify the price. Size of the wheelbase, length, width, etc, alone is (and I'm with C&D here) will not be enough to make the choice clear between the two -- the A4 will have to lead with more ""stuff"" more lux stuff and more performance than the A3 at any one point in time. Perhaps, the 2015 S4 will be more heavily discounted due to the birth of the S3 in the US next month -- get 'em while their hot for about a year. I may be wrong throwing my lot in with C&D, but I just can't see what the A4/S4 development team has as an alternative to the A3/S3 but to take the A4/S4 upstream, so to speak. Please make your argument to the contrary, I would really love to think the A4 family can and will hold its own, will be differentiated sufficiently from the A3 to keep the A4 sales on an upward trajectory. I just don't see any alternative for the A4 but to head for the top (of course this will likely mean a stupid price delta will ""erupt"" between the cars -- something like I was lamenting regarding the price difference between an S4 and an S6.)"
3692,"August 12, 2014 10:39PM",flightnurse," Why does the A4 have to have more ""luxury"" to differentiated itself from the A3? Also how can Audi make it more Luxury? The A3 is about the same size as the first gen A4, so if the A3 is too small for some, the current A4 is bigger and roomier which would fit most people. One can get the same 2L turbo engine in the A3 as in the A4, I think the A4 should get a power boost, say in the 230-240hp range and keep the A3 at the current HP rating. Now for the S4, 333hp is not enough to make it faster then the S3 Audi can either increase HP or not worry about it. Again, people who want a bigger car then S3 will move up to a S4, I'm sure there are some items that can not be had on the S3 that you can get with the S4."
3693,"August 12, 2014 10:44PM",flightnurse," I agree and I'm 6' also, granted I think the A3 is more for people who want a premium brand without paying the premium price, since a mid level A3 is around 32K which is rougly the medium cost of a new car today."

Now, then, that comment might suggest Audi will enlarge the A4 -- I guess there would be a temptation to do that; there is an A4L in China (at least) to be sure. Making the A4/S4 more luxury, high-tech contented is, I think (I have no secret or insider info) virtually inevitable -- if not for the competition from the A3/S3, just the competition from the market itself."

I really liked the feel of the car and the smooth power from the supercharged V-6 during the test drive. Basically, how do you enjoy owning and driving the car, and how livable is it. Also, how has Audi been to deal with? I have previously owned BMW 335i and 128i with sport packages. Enjoyed them both. How woul you compare the S4? Thanks in advance for any feedback."

3717,"August 16, 2014  4:37PM",graphicguy,"OK....for no other reason than I'm interested in a lot of diffrent cars, and I MAY BE in the market in the next 24 months, AND I was in close proximity to both a Lexus and an Infiniti dealer last night after work, I did some test driving. This is hot on the heals of doing the BMW drive event. I like BMWs. I wanted to drive the M235i, but they didn't have any to test drive....only 4 series. 435i xDrive, with sport pack? Yep....I'll take two. Problem is, I think BMW has now started to believe their own marketing hype. And, they've priced themselves accordingly. Not sure you get anything more than what I got from my former E92.... less, actually. But, there's been a definite rise in price while staying the same or getting worse in some areas (steering being the most obvious). High $50s? Low $60s? Sorry I'll drop out of that market. Some will walk into their local BMW store with $60K burning a hole in their pocket for a 3/4 series not knowing what else they could get for that kind of money. I'm sure they aren't going to miss me, though. They're doing fine without me. Infiniti Q50.......drove an AWD version with sport wheels and supposedly sport suspension. It was either too soft, wandering, needing constant minute corrections to stay straight, or doing the same thing, with much higher effort involved. Electronics feels like a cold Windows 3.1 boot up. $50K? I'll take the highly discounted G37x Sport for $10K+ less. Not bad looking, mind you. Just not my cup of tea (yet again). Lexus....IS350 F Sport. Tried to buy one when they first came out. Dealer didn't want to deal, so no dice. Now, they're ready to deal I see why the trade rags have rated this car higher than the 3 series. The grill is a love it-hate it affair. I'm used to that (with my TL), though. Drive it as fast as you want, however you want, wherever you want. Very nicely weighted steering. Really fine handling/ride feel. As is typical for Lexus, very good materials and build quialty. The one I drove was $49K, pretty loaded up with Nav, leather, sunroof, etc. Probably the prettiest grey paint job I've seen on any car (Nebula Grey). Out of the shoot, sales manager (who introduced himself after the test drive was over), said the IS I drove would be in the $47K range (maybe get serious in the $45K-$46K range?). If/when I get ready to buy, I'll come back to give them a shot at my business. Once again, the 3/4 Series are nice cars. The IS350 is better, for significantly less money. I informed all the dealers I was not in the market. This is the difference between high end dealerships and the ones that know at some point they want you back into their store. They'll acknowledge you're ""just looking"" and offer to be there when you're ready. This, tied to what I've seen from Benz and Acura recently, not a bad time to be shopping for an ELLPS."

Got Dunlop WinterSports mounted on (on sale) alloys for the winter from Tire Rack, did el swappo winter/summer. Big improvement, snow problem solved. Then, of course, I traded the TL for the Jag XK. A natural progression, happens all the time. OEM Dunlop Summer tires made even saying the word ""snow"" out loud a dangerous thing! First 1/8"" snowfall and I couldn't get up my mildly steep driveway. Luckily, SUV in the garage to the rescue...

Handled this past winter's best with aplomb. But, should my next sled by RWD, I wouldn't hesitate to buy another set of winter tires, probably again on rims.

With all the toys now nobody has room in their garage anymore. Half the people can't even fit two cars into their two car garage. FN..reading comments on Bimmerfest and extrapolating that to the general population is referencing a very small and select sample of the population. Hardly the reference work to use to get an overall picture of reality. Living in AZ certainly doesn't give you a lot of direct knowledge of the nations snow tire use either. Do a lot of people that live in snow country which also run summer tires on sports cars also change to snows in winter? Probably. A majority? Who really knows.

But, they had summer only rubber. Put something half way descent M&S tires and they would go. Tire technology has indeed advanced in the last half dozen years. I know the first time I encountered run flats were in a 330i (RWD). No problems in the snow, but they made the car ride like a brick. Those run flats are better these days. Even the all season tires on my son's Fiesta and the wife's Accord are better than the ones I've encountered just 5 years ago. As you state, with the computers and sensors in today's cars, things have to be pretty severe to get stuck or go flying into the weeds (barring shear stupidity while driving) in the snow. Even rental cars can get around with their ""base model"" tires. Spent a lot of time from Logan Airport to Lynn, Marlborough, Acton, Waltham, etc.....summer, winter, didn't matter. Coming in and out of the ""Big Dig"" was a challenge. Never got stuck. Never got sideways. Always in a rental car."
3732,"August  7, 2014  5:37PM",m6user,"So since Bimmerfest was just a sample of your reference and you seem to be so sure that snow tire use is widespread, what are a few of the other sources you're basing your statement on? Traction control and other electronic nannies as you call them would seem to further lessen the use snow tires to some degree. The nannies and very good quality all-season tires have led to smaller and smaller percentage of snow tire users IMO. I think there are small regions in the N.E. where topography and winter snowfall probably lends to a much higher percentage of snow tire use than most areas. Anywhere where mountains and lots of snowfall cross paths would make them popular. But in probably 80% of the country they see very little use."

3739,"August 11, 2014  9:26PM",markcincinnati,"I Never Would Have Thought of This Outcome: I wouldn’t want you to think that I take advantage of my Audi dealer’s willingness to throw me the keys to a new A3, A6, A7, Q5, Q7, S4, SQ5, S6 or TT (who me?!) – I’ve not really been interested in driving an A8 and the S8’s and R8’s are almost always “sold cars,” besides since my dealer knows when either my wife or I am “in the market,” I’d hate to push it by putting them in the position of having to say “no” especially since we’ve only had our 2014 “S” Audis for months, not years. It was with the full understanding that we are not currently in the market that my wife and I decided that Saturday last was the day we would test drive a new Audi. We thought long and hard about taking a test drive of either a 2014 A6 3.0T or a 2015 A6 2.0T with the sport package and lots of options. Both of these cars were on the lot and not “sold” cars. My wife asked me what I really, really wanted to drive, now, if I could only drive one car, I immediately answered a new “S6” – that was easy. A few minutes after walking in the showroom door, we were handed the keys to a 2014 S6 with about 300 miles on the OD and with a few choice options: cold weather package, black wood and aluminum trim, black interior and panther black exterior. Also present: 20” wheel upgrade (from the standard 19” inchers). Since the designation of the S6’s is now Prestige, there were very few features the car didn’t have – it did not have the top view camera for example, or the automatic cruise control including stop and go, etc. To my eye, I sat down, behind the wheel of The Batmobile (the color combo having a lot to do with that) and pressed the start button only to be immediately more than a little impressed by the “awakening.” Unfortunately, this car was an S6, not an S5, RS5 or even S4. I say unfortunately because the car was clearly focused 90% on the luxury side of sport-luxury. This became even more evident when I put the car into drive (which means “S” or sport mode since I had set the steering and air suspension to Dynamic (along with the engine and transmission) using Audi-Drive-Select. I ultimately changed the steering to Auto mode which gives the car super easy turns at slow speed, but tightens things up considerably as the MPHs climb. Speaking of climbing, I got onto a nearby Interstate (I-275 by-pass, eastbound) and was cruising along at a steady 60MPH – when all of a sudden, I floored the S6 and counted to three (one, two, three) – I counted pretty quickly too -- certainly 1, 2, 3! (think Sia) -- in less than three seconds. I released the accelerator completely and looked down at the speedometer only to see an indicated 102MPH. The sensation I had was, well, muted, subdued, suppressed – sublime. There was virtually no drama, barely any sound (angry engine or otherwise) lingered at all, and I was coasting down but still showing an indicated 90+-something on the speedo. What did I do next? Well, I “punched” the accelerator pedal for another Sia-like one-two-three moment, signaled right for the rapidly rushing at me exit ramp, hit the ramp at incredible speed, barely “mashed” the brake pedal only to get a momentary sensation that the S6 had impossibly instantaneously scrubbed off about 80 miles per hour (and almost magically seemed to be going backwards the descent was that swift) as I damn near just coasted to a stop as if nothing had happened 1-second ago. Meanwhile, I awaited the traffic-light to glow green. I tried out the S6’s handling envelope using my completely accurate and totally made up (therefore unscientific) routine of driving faster and faster and faster in a circle, then carving through an imaginary slalom barely nicking those [also imaginary] orange cones. The thing carves like a hot knife through buttah! A little, not much, body roll – but hey, this thing is a full-sized vehicle, remember. Here’s the thing, after my test drive – during which time I became thoroughly smitten – I drove (in sequence) our 2014 SQ5 and next up our 2014 S4. Now, I read the mfgr’s published 0-60 numbers for all three of these “S” vehicles, and the S6 is, after all, the quickest of the three, on-paper. The thing is my $58,000 S4 is very quiet, too, and I have the upgraded seats (which certainly seem very similar to the S6’s) further blurring the differences -- between the S4 and S6. My B&O sound system edges out the S6’s Bose system by a small but discernable difference, especially in the clarity department – the B&O tweeters are really impressive, the Bose’s less so. The S6 however, commands, no, demands your attention – much more so than the Ibis White S4, which seems to have a bit less “presence” than the Panther Black S6. Regarding the S6: I want one, I want one, I want one – and for perhaps $68-$70,000 (as equipped), I would actually say the value is really there. The thing is, however, the bottom line on the sticker was $79,500+. It (the S6) just didn’t seem to be THAT much more car, even though it would be worth considering hocking the family jewels and taking out a second mortgage. I loved the S6, I mean I really loved the car – it just isn’t worth (to me), as far as I can tell, $22,000 more than my S4 or $19,000 more than my wife’s SQ5. With an emphasis on more performance, I would possibly see where the money went – however, the emphasis is on luxury, isolation and stealth. Where the S4 is an iron fist with a velvet glove on it, the S6 is an iron fist wrapped in thick density foam with a velvet glove on it. I guess for nearly 80 grand, folks might well prefer stealth to show-off. I think I get that. Me? Well let’s just say, I’d like a bit more sturm und drang."

3746,"August 12, 2014  2:13PM",markcincinnati,"The new Car & Driver tests the almost here S3 (and at its price point, it ought to be in the ELLPS family). The article opens and closes suggesting that the S3 will cannibalize sales from the S4. After reading the review, I would mostly agree -- but, as the S6 is to the S4 (that is to say way more luxurious but with plenty of go and stop talent), I would think the next S4 we will get will distance itself from the S3 by virtue of great gobs of power (instead of 333HP, how about 395 -- 100 more than the S3 as a nice round number?) and even more luxury bits and pieces. I mean the new S4 has to have (or be) a step up either in performance or luxury or both -- and Audi probably will go with a decent power upgrade over the current S4, but likely will go with a huge dollop of lux given the brand's positioning. Perhaps if there is an RS4, there will be great gobs of new power and large lumps of added luxury. I mean, really, other than the satisfaction of knowing you're in an S4 (and paid more), C&D is right, for most folks the S3 will be the one to asipire to. My gawd, the S3 can be had for the price of an A4 -- and only loose a bit of trunk space and rear leg room. Most folks here will drive the car solo or have but one front-seat adult passenger. The only thing lacking from the new S3 is the torque vectoring rear diff. Wouldn't surprise me if they figured out how to do that within a model year or so. One last thing, a prediction: Given my recent S6 test drive: the new S6, whenever that comes out, will loose 2 more pistons, but manage to have more power and get better mileage and with it being a V6, the car will be less nose heavy, improving its handling performance."
3747,"August 12, 2014  4:12PM",flightnurse," Mark, have you sat in a A3 yet? From what I have read the rear seat are pretty cramp for adults like they were for the first gen A4. I thought the A3 was a way to get people into the Audi fold be offering a lower entry point.

3752,"August  6, 2014  2:20PM",graphicguy," Bradd....I'm not going anywhere..... :smiley: FN.....Until I was with my sister, test driving 320i/8i, I didn't see the appeal of the 320i. Driving one, if your priority is not stop light wars, but a well made, good handling car, the 320i offers all those attributes. Gotta say, you get a car that if you're careful with the options list, for mid-high $30s, that you don't have to worry about, at all, for anything, for 4 years, that's appealing. Lots of reviews coming in for the TLS. Seems as if the press cars have some sort of glitch where there's some hesitation coming off the line when you first hit the gas. I didn't experience that. Both the 4 and 6 cvl pulled strongly at throttle tip in. I estimate 0-60 in the low 5 sec range, add a second to that for the 4 cyl. Are they the fastest? No. But, they will be competitive to an ATS or CTS, A4, A6 (4 cyl), Infiniti Q (pick one), Lexus IS/ES. Unless you go to a blown V6 (like in the S4/A6) or turbo'd BMW motors (at much higher cost), you'll be right in line with the field. And, you'll have to climb the price ladder quite a bit to really get significantly better performance. But, the suspension is where the car really shines. It feels as sophisticated as anything I've ever driven. It trumps BMW and BMW's own game. Ride/handling is superb. Acuras are notorious for holding great resale. I can see this trend continuing. It is now back on top the tech heap, too. Good looking interior with high quality build and materials. In short, it feels much more expensive than it is. Can you tell I like the new TLS?"

I purchased the revamped MDX that came out in 2007 - think it was the 1st one Acura had introduced with sh-awd. Paid under50K for fully loaded. Similarly equipped BMW and Audi were north of 65K. There were quite a few car magazine reviews that had put that MDX best in terms of handling over X5 due to sh-awd. Not that was my priority, but it made the decision easier. I still have it and it is going strong with nothing more than regular scheduled maintenance. That said, it still does not compare to driving a RWD BMW for me. I will have to drive a TLX to compare to the 320i that I just got. Here's another review of TLX - http://www.digitaltrends.com/car-reviews/2015-acura-tlx-review/, recommending to get the four cylinder over v6. They say: if the V6 model is Tim Duncan, the four-cylinder is Chris Paul."
3759,"August  6, 2014  5:03PM",flightnurse," BMW has gotten a bad rap on the suspension/handling of the F30 and F10 cars but there is a easy fix to this, order the Dynamic Handling Package (DHP in BMW language) cost $1,400. BMW in the past had been criticized on how ""harsh"" it's ride was, so for the F30 they went a little softer (more on this) however, DHP allows BMW to have the best of both worlds, creating a softer ride and keeping the sporting handling. Graphic I'm surprised that the 4 series you drove did not have this. The only F30 not to get DHP is the 320, but this will change, the sales of 320i have exceeded BMW sale projection and for 2015 new options and color choices will be available to it. My BMW dealer will be hosting their Ultimate Driving Experience here in the next week, I have reserved 3 cars, M235i, 428 Grand Coupe and 5 series Activehybrid. Now regarding the F30 and it's soft ride, in our house we have a unique chance of driving two cars from two different mind sets. Ricks Genesis and my 320i. I think Rick has enough seat time in both cars to see first hand the difference between them. Latley, I would say the last 3 months Rick has been driving my car a little more and he is picking me up at the airport in it, he tells me the ride in my 320 had a better feel, a more ""planted"" feel on the road and the ride is more controlled then his Genesis also Rick says the steering has better feel."

3764,"August  6, 2014  6:35PM",stickguy,"FN, I think that very few people have any interest in winter tires, outside of the ""nuts"" that live in Alaska or other huge snow areas. Even there, AWD and AS tires seems preferable. I am in NJ. No one swaps here, unless they have dedicated hi po summer rubber, and half the time they don't either. That is fun to see in snow!"
3765,"August  6, 2014  7:16PM",nyccarguy,"@flightnurse‌ Yes RWD cars fitted with dedicated winter tires should do fine when the white stuff falls. @kyfdx and @roadburner both have RWD BMWs and have had ZERO problems getting around. I agree with @stickguy. For the most part, people don't want to be bothered. Me included. If you want a RWD BMW, MB, Lexus, Infiniti you'll have to special order it here in the North East. I'm also sure that you'll have to put down a hefty, non-refundable deposit too. 2 Winters (1 Mild, 1 Not So Mild) with AWD and All Season Tires and I'm impressed. BMW's X-Drive is so transparent and works so well that you'd be hard pressed to know when power is being sent up front. My car passed its lease end inspection a few minutes ago.

3766,"August  6, 2014  7:35PM",flightnurse," I wouldn't say that, it's really hard to explain, but the two car companies have different philosophy when it comes to how each of their cars perform. Now don't get me wrong, the Genesis is a great car, earlier this year I had to drive to San Diego weekly and on one drive took the Genesis it soaked up the miles... Just as a E class would, but not like how a F30 or F10 does. I feel people over state how the steering in the F30 really is, it's not the worse and it's not the best..."
3767,"August  6, 2014  7:38PM",flightnurse," Big statement there stick...

Good old hydraulic, belt driven, power steering. An adaptive suspension that reacts to road conditions & steering inputs (electronically). MB is a big company and can throw major incentives in the form of trunk money, cheap financing, & attractive lease rates. I agree that price is a factor, even when you get north of $50K."
3798,"August  5, 2014  3:50AM",graphicguy,"Stick....thanks. Get this out of the way up front, The TLX looks much better in person than the pics I've seen. Dealer had two cars....one black with a sweet dark saddle interior. i really like that combo. The other one was white with black interior. The interiors are a big upgrade over mine, and pretty much turns it into a leader in the segment. All controls move with precision and smoothness that lead the pack. The 4 has an 8 speed, dual clutch trans. Fun drive. The DCT performs extremely well. Steering is light, and precise. It tightens up well as you gain speed....very linear. Gun it, and it leaps. Quick, firm shifts with ""blip"" matching revs. It's as roomy inside as my TL. They say it has shorter front and rear overhangs. Maybe. Not sure. Plenty of rear seat room. Seat of pants tells me 0-60 around 6-6.5 secs. Leather is good...better than the fake stuff other brands tout. Better than most premium leathers in other premium brands. Dual screens...top one for NAV. Bottom one for audio and HVAC. This car will compete well with 4 cyl A4s, 320/8i, C300 4 cyl. The V6 was a FWD Advance. It was as loaded as any car I've ever driven. 9 speed push button trans. It's always in the right gear and will run to redline in every gear. It will snap to any gear firmly....right now! Great seats, very high quality materials. Super quiet. Again...steering was light but tightened up at speed. Suspension is really refined and sophisticated...comparable to a much more expensive car. Nothing seems to upset it....and I tried. I expect 0-60 to be in the low to mid 5s. Like the 4, it loves to run and sounds/feels smooth, typical Acura motors. These just seem to want run hard. P-AWS is slick....you point.....it goes...no drama, understeer well controlled....as fast as you dare to go. I saw the MSRP of the V6 Advance.....~$42K. Not sure about the 4 cyl. That includes the ELS surround system (best I've heard in a car), lane keeping, intelligent cruise, sunroof, really nice leather, remote start...everything. A BMW 3 or 4, A/S4, C class would easily cost an extra $10K to $15K for something similar. Dealer said Acura is giving $1,500 discount and $500 in ""add-ons"" for anyone trading an '08 on up. They had two demos (which I drove). But had sold the 4 they got in stock Last weekend. This car is going to be a hit. Plus, the headlights are really cool."
3799,"August  5, 2014  2:11PM",stickguy,"Makes me want one. The 4 would be plenty for me. 2 weeks back when I was in for service the salesman said the were giving a preorder discount, plus the $500 in ad dons if you put a deposit down to get on the list. Does sound like it could be a hit."
3800,"August  5, 2014  2:52PM",graphicguy,"stick....I can see the 4 cyl being the volume leader. That's a whole lot of car for mid-high $30s. Plus, it was fun to drive...built as good as anything I've ever driven...that includes some pretty nice cars. My sales man, given his job is to sell cars, tried to get me to trade. He can't. The car is ""too hot"" right now for a skinny deal. Anyone in the market in this segment owes it to themselves to put the TL at the top of their shopping list, though."
3801,"August  5, 2014  5:46PM",benjaminh,"Accord EXL Navi vs. Acura TLX Tech Since I love having built-in navi, this will be a comparison of the Accord EXL Navi ($30,835) with the Acura TLX with Tech Package ($35,025), and so we're looking at a difference of $5k. We all know that to get a good discount on a TLX anything close to what you can get on the Accord you'd need to wait c. 4-6 months for production to ramp up. But I can wait. My 2008 Accord EXL navi 5MT is working quite well, and is still under the HondaCare warranty all the way until Jan. of 2016. Here's my very subjective evaluation of what each feature of the TLX might be ""worth"" to me personally, compared to an Accord EXL navi. I admit, I haven't yet been in the car, but I do trust Honda/Acura to create a good quality product, since I've owned 3 Accords and had good experiences with all of them.... 8-speed dual-clutch transmission compared to CVT: $1000 206 hp engine compared to 185 for the Accord: $600 PAWS precision all-wheel steering: $600 larger performance tires/better alloy wheels: $600 Upgraded brakes (320mm vs. 292mm): $400 440-watt ELS Studio surround 10-speaker: $800 JewelEye LED headlights $300 60/40 split fold down seats: $300 Premium interior including Milano leather: $800 Very nice exterior+structural upgrades: $800 longer warranty: $400 tilt down mirrors: $200 paddle shifters: $300 Real Time Traffic: $200 Rain sensing wipers: $200 Blind Spot Info system: $300 Lane Keeping Assist: $300 Rear Cross Traffic Monitor: $300 Driver's side Knee airbag: $300 Integrated Dynamic System (Econ, Normal, Sport, Sport +): $400 -$600 for LaneWatch which comes with the Accord but not on the Acura. Some of this stuff I have no idea if I'd like. Lane Keeping Assist? I hope I pay attention and drive for myself (wish everyone would hang-up and drive), but maybe useful....? Rain sensing wipers? Surely I'm not so lazy or blind that I can't turn the wipers on?? So I didn't put much down for those. I imagine an Acura engineer looking at how much time and $ it cost for them to put that in would be annoyed at me. But a great sound system like the award-winning ELS set-up is worth a lot to me. Quite possibly I'm still missing some things. But anyway, admitting that this is very subjective and a total guess (since I haven't yet driven a TLX), but based on the strong reviews, as well as my strong trust in Honda/Acura this upgrade to the TLX seems to be ""worth it"" to me. In fact, it seems to add up to: c. $8500 or so imaginary dollars of ""worth it"" to me for a c. 5k price. Seems like Acura is trying to get back in the game by making the TLX a lot of car and a lot of tech for the money. Sorry this is so long...."
3802,"August  5, 2014  5:53PM",graphicguy,"Benjamin....those of us who remember how Acura got into the U.S. luxury car market was by doing the exact same thing they're doing now. They're putting a very feature and tech rich car, that competes with drivetrain and suspension that rivals (sometimes exceeds) their much more expensive German counterparts. Looks like they're getting back to that winning formula."
3803,"August  5, 2014  6:19PM",benjaminh,"Yes. I remember admiring the original Legend in 1986 when I was in college for those very reasons. This one's about the size of the Legend too. And so maybe I'll get to own a TLX with a little ghost of a ""Legend"" in it after all. It does seem to represent a great value for the money. And made in Ohio is a plus!+++ All three of my Accords were made at Marysville, and they have all been great cars."
3804,"August  5, 2014  6:58PM",nyccarguy,"@graphicguy‌ I'm checking out the standard features on the ""base"" model for $30,995 and am digging it. All Wheel Steering, Bluetooth, Backup Camera, Dual Clutch Gearbox. Although I do like the 18"" Wheels on the V6 model better. Once these TLXs hit the streets, there are going to be some very nice used 2013 - 2014 TL SH AWDs getting traded in & leases ending for the mid-high $20s."

I have a college friend that moved to Hawaii right after we graduated. Cost of living is obviously out of sight. But, she never looked back, As she said....""my house may not be as nice as yours, but I'm waking up everyday to the most beautiful sunrises in the world, and ending my work day to the most beautiful sunsets in the world."" Something to be said for that. Although, she bemoans not being close to main land friends and relatives. For example, when her parents passed away, she couldn't get back (for you locals, she grew up in Middletown, OH....a small rusty town) for the services. She missed them by a day. She only gets back here about once every 5 years or more. She said when she first moved there, although she's a U.S. Citizen like the native Hawaiians are, some treated her badly, as if she were an intruder. I guess the way Hawaii became a state was not to everyone's liking when it happened. Some want the Monarchy to be put back in place.

3831,"July 30, 2014  3:09PM",graphicguy,"So, last weekend, by invite, I went to the BMW drive event at my local BMW dealer. Always a fun event. For those unfamiliar with it, BMW, through the local dealer, allows you to drive their cars, and the competitors' models, back-to-back. I chose the 435i xDrive, as that is the successor to my beloved former 335ix coupe (E82). Total redesign....interior and exterior. As best as I could tell, the drivetrain is a little ""tamer"" in the 435. But, that could be because I had a performance package on my former coupe. Still, these are Bavarian muscle cars. The uncommunicative steering was the most noticeable. It's not that the steering wasn't up to the chore of spirited driving. It's that you were never sure if it could do what you asked it to do. You pointed it, and the car followed, but I was never sure it would. Maybe with time and experience, you get used to it. I preferred the steering in my E92. The other big complaint is that people felt they made the suspension to soft. I don't get that. I think the suspension is a worthy upgrade to the suspension in the E92. It soaks up broken pavement better, even at speed, without unduly upsetting the cabin. Not a huge difference over the E92 mind you. But, a worthy one. I liked it. The new 4 is definitely bigger than my previous 3. I liked my E92. I like the F32, I think. It definitely has more ""creases"" (my technical term). Headlights are the same with the BMW ""ring"" DRLs. Plenty of room. My tester did not have the sports seats. Coming from the sports seats in my TL SH AWD (which are some of the best in the biz, IMHO), this was immediately noticeable. Wasn't a fan of them in my E92. Still not a fan of the standard seats in the F32. Nice dash with color heads up display.....EXCEPT.....the display disappears when wearing sun glasses. Usually BMW thinks these types of things through. This time they failed. Kind of defeats the purpose of a HUD if you can see it only on overcast days. Whose idea was it to make that auto shifter so convoluted? It's a beer tap looking thingy. In unfortunate BMW fashion, instead of just putting it in ""D"" or ""R"" depending on what you want, you push a button, pull a lever, do this, do that, just to put it in gear. Why make something so simple, so complex? Stereo was the standard one. I had the HK in my E92. The standard stereo is worse than the HK. The HK wasn't all that great to begin with. Neither is all that good compared to the one in my TL (ELS)....not even close. The iDrive has evolved. It only took BMW over a decade to get it to a reasonable level of operation and ease of use. But, it's now good. You can write on the top of the little dial between the seats to input a letter. Not so good while driving. A little better when stopped. Not nearly as good as the same Audi technology on the A6 w/Nav. As has been mentioned before, the NAV screen looked like an afterthought. The ""start/stop"" technology seems a bit smoother than the last one I drive in a 4 cal 328i. Still needs work, though. Usually I don't sit in the back seat, particularly in a coupe. I tried it out with the 4, though. Entrance and exit weren't bad, given the (slow) electric seats that will move out of the way. But, if you're looking for cost cutting, this is where you'll find it. Back seat was filled with hard plastics that sounded very ""cheap"" when you knocked on them. All-in-all, still drives like a BMW. Offers good handling, and decent comfort, all while going fast.....very fast. On a tech note, BMW has joined those in the top tier. iDrive is good and offers everything you could want and is relatively easy to use. If you want the ""snob"" appeal, the BMW muscle car feel, the maintenance and warranty that covers practically everything, and the uber good BMW dealership experience where they take care of everything for you, this is your choice. At a price, that is. My tester had an MSRP of $57K. For that kind of money (and for a whole lot less), you can find other cars that are just as good, if not better. Still, I have a soft spot for the 3 series (now the 4). They do a whole lot really, really well. The dealer experience is superlative. I know they are the car to lease vs buy. So, maybe I'm not the person they're targeting. Drove the competition......C350 4matic coupe. Will do another post for that drive."
3832,"July 30, 2014  5:52PM",Mr_Shiftright,"Oh yeah, please do. I have a friend who might be shopping for a C class."
3833,"July 30, 2014  6:21PM",roadburner, When I went to the Ultimate Drive at my dealer they had a 435i M Sport fitted with just about every M Performance accessory you can get. A 4er similarly equipped would be one of the few new BMWs I would actually want to own.
3834,"July 30, 2014  6:39PM",graphicguy,"Mr Shiftwright.....the Benz C350 4matic wasn't a car I expected to like, but surprisingly did. Probably not a good thing for a BMW comparison drive event. I just went with my sister to help her buy a C300 4Matic sedan. The coupe felt like a different car. The engine was stronger than the C300. It gave up some power to the really excellent twin scroll turbo 6 in the 335i. But, in the Benz, the 3.5L felt quick, I'd dare to say, fast enough (about the same as my seat of the pants feel in my TL). It was smooth. I think it may have had ""start/stop"" technology. But, compared to the BMW's implementation, it was so hard to tell, it might not have. Just goes to show what a little better engineering for something like that can achieve. The C, while entertaining to drive, seemed more relaxed in doing it than the BMW. Granted, the BMW was probably better when driving at 10/10ths. The Benz felt better everywhere else in the driving experience. The Benz was easier to drive fast than the BMW. I'd say that's true of the Benz over my previous S4, too. It's not as fast on an absolute basis. But, it's easier to drive fast in every day driving. The suspension really did offer a good ride/handling feel....very well sorted, with a premium ride that not so much isolated you, but made it so you really didn't care of there was broken pavement underneath you. It stayed eminently composed while not doing anything untoward while traveling around corners and/or over bad pavement. Materials.....very nice. The one I drove had leather......good leather....extra cost leather. Seats were better than in the BMW, but still not quite as good as in the TL. Same goes for the stereo (H/K, again). Not bad, but not nearly as good as the ELS in the Acura. All the other materials, and their execution/build, etc were a ⅓ step above the BMW. Very nicely done...felt expensive....even the way the dials worked. Where it falls down...who in the world designed the cruise/turn signals? How can you use one without engaging the other. They're both on the same side of the steering wheel, in the same vicinity. Somebody at Mercedes needs to lose their job over that design faux pas. The nav and knob system felt a couple of generations behind BMW's iDrive or the Nav/buttons in my Acura. The Mercedes took forever to boot up. Once it did, it seems it took multiple inputs to do even the simplest tasks. Whereas you could find areas of cost cutting in the BMW, you found no such items anywhere in the Benz. Everything looked, felt and functioned with a premium look and operational feel. So, to sum up. The C350 4matic coupe is fast, comfortable, handles well, rides well, feels premium.....AND..... It was $2K-$3K cheaper than a ""like for like"" 435ix BMW. Icing on the cake....while subjective....I found the Mercedes to look lots better than the BMW, too. While you may get the premium customer treatment at Mercedes, maintenance is extra cost. From what I understand, a fair amount of extra cost. Perhaps this is one of those cars you never take back to the dealership for routine maintenance. Maybe this is one you get to know an indecent mechanic who is fair in what they charge."

But, I won't be in the market for another 2-3 years, so it really doesn't matter right now, at least for me. I will put the C400 on my shopping list, though."

Personally? That '14 C350 coupe is mighty sweet. I'd be tempted to get it instead of waiting. I also learned that the C350 coupe is relatively hard to come by vs the much more common C250.

An A4 with AWD is a very good car to drive. http://www.guideautoweb.com/en/specifications/compare/12087,7634/ A little sobering, actually. The 320i has such a weak engine given the price you pay.

Now for 2015, the 320i will get a power boost, officially BMW has not stated what is it, but talk is between 200-210hp, the 328i is also getting a power boost too. Now the new M3/4 are nice cars, but are they practical? Some people will say yes and some will say no. But BMW wont have a problem selling every single one.

Really good suspension and toss able, as it's much lighter than my previous 335i coupe. Audi is off the table based on hearing of my experience. C class was underwhelming....still a $45K car with some equipment added on, that felt ponderous compared to the 320i.

3861,"July 19, 2014  1:41AM",markcincinnati,"We live in a little town about 20 miles north of the CBD of Cincinnati. The routes to get from home to the CBD (approximately where my wife and I work), include I-71, looping around from north to south by sort of going east on I-275 and heading down the back road (or so it seems) of Wooster Pike and SR 50. OK, with that much info at hand, I must say it is virtually impossible to use more than a relatively small fraction of the potential of an S4 or SQ5. I had, for about 5 seconds, thought it would be cool to change out the supercharger pulley and engine management software for more torque and horsepower. But to what end? There are so few opportunities where I can push my S4 -- I, so far, literally overtake every other car on any of the above mentioned hi-ways and roads. The ""joy"" of punching it on a freeway entrance ramp is something I would love to do -- unfortunately the acceleration is so quick (sub 50-seconds to 100kph) I overtake everything and end up hitting the brakes hard. I wouldn't give up the feeling of deep wells of power and torque that these S cars offer -- but I must say, it has become virtually impossible to ""play with"" the power offered in a sane and unselfish manner. Tuning the Auidi S's or the ""35"" BMW engines would certainly boost their power, torque and therefore increase their ""accelerative"" force and overall thrust -- but I have now reached the point that I see no merit in chipping, changing out the exhaust system, etc, since I can't use (and enjoy) the factory force available. I assume the same frustrations are ""enjoyed"" by certain Cadillac, Mercede, Volvo, Porsche and other ""sported up"" model owners -- at least if you live in just about any medium to large US city. You finally get a modern ""hot rod"" and you literally can only tap into a fraction of its capabilities. Kind of a drag."
3862,"July 19, 2014  2:42AM",roadburner,My two favorite cars in the garage are the fastest(MS3) and the slowest(Club Sport). And I have absolutely no problem pushing either to the edge of their respective performance envelopes- that's what HPDEs are for!
3863,"July 19, 2014  3:37PM",markcincinnati,"I have been to no less than 8 HPDEs and you are correct roadburner, you can push the cars (however the HPDEs I have attended supplied the cars for us, we weren't allowed to use our own). However, I was thinking more of the ""everyday"" that I ""remember"" from past years. I'm not suggesting I want to get on a crowded (and ours almost always are) interstate and floor it, consequences be damned. My ""wistful"" intents are more to find a relatively deserted stretch where I can ""punch it"" with the only concern being getting a speeding ticket, not endangering the clog of cars (and their drivers and passengers, of course). Of our many trips to Germany, some of my fondest memories have to do with taking my BMW, Mercedes or Audi rental on the autobahn and driving from Berlin to Munich where there are some fairly long stretches of the autobahn that have no speed limit. During those driving moments I had no sense of danger or that our collective high speeds were reckless. Here, as the freeways are ever more crowded and people pass on the right or sit in the far left lane and cruise along below the posted speed limit, driving has become much more like work -- and increasingly risky work at that. We'll go to an HPDE perhaps once or twice every five years -- always love them, but I guess I'm looking for an American Autobahn -- not gonna happen in my lifetime. Next up our cars are going to (already are) provide ever more driver aids that take the wheel, accelerator and brake away from us. Driving and our car culture are changing -- and I am, usually, in favor of the change. This time, however, what I am longing for is my memory restricted return to having fun behind the wheel as we did not that many years ago. It's the weekend, it's summer -- I'm going to go out and find a curvy ""back road"" (whatever that means anymore) and carve it up. I'll get over it in a minute. There, I'm over it."
3864,"July 19, 2014  4:05PM",roadburner,"Driving at high speeds in virtually a straight line gets boring after a while. Fortunately my job involves a lot of driving and I often choose to take a nearly deserted rural two lane as opposed to a dull interstate slog, which allows me to enjoy the handling prowess of whichever car I'm driving. The Club Sport requires a bit of finesse and the ability to conserve momentum. You have to make sure it is always in the right gear at the right time(fortunately the pedal placement is ideal for heel/toe downshifts). In contrast, the MS3-fitted with Koni FSDs and Michelin PSS tires-simply bludgeons the road to death; just leave it in third gear, turn in really late with a bit of trailing brake, and nail the throttle once you see daylight(or, as I've said before, visualize obedience training a bipolar pit bull that is mainlining crystal meth). Think of it this way: if the Club Sport is a Steyr SSG 69, the MS3 is a Colt AR-15 with an extended capacity magazine."
3865,"July 19, 2014  5:04PM",graphicguy,"Loved the power of both the 335i and the S4. Seems Audi has issues with some of the cars that use recent iterations of their Quattro system, as I've seen mention in some of the trade rags about the same ""grinding"" issues I experienced. There wasn't much on the road that could beat you in stop light wars, though. It would have to be a very recent muscle car, and the persin driving it would have to know how to launch. Or, AMG, RS, M, etc tuner cars. Aside from that, not much can touch them. That said, I do think the TL SH AWD, while not as fast in a straight line vs the S4 or 335i (but certainly more than capable), feels more balanced, confidence inspiring and entertaining in its own right.

But, then again, I might be right. The comment somewhere, ""it's missing a pedal"" is one I personally relate to -- but, well that's two of us. Audi, BMW, et al, certainly WANT our money -- but there is probably very little (if any at all) financial reason to offer 6-speed manual transmissions any more. We're lucky -- I think -- to have the wonderful 7-speed DSG unit that Audi uses in several of its cars, I'm as fine as wine with that transmission. Heck, I've even come 'round to the 8-speed tiptronic when tuned for performance shifting. And, even were I not happy with the 8-speed Audis and BMWs and the 7-speed unit employed by Mercedes, well, I really don't count much anymore. BMW is selling a lot of cars these days -- up over 12%. The super-majority of these sales, I assume, came with automatic transmissions. Good for BMW. Ditto at Audi and MB -- at least I assume so. It has been ""forever"" (2004 or 2005) since I saw, let alone drove a manual transmission at an Audi or BMW dealership. My last stick was an Audi allroad -- 2003 model. My wife's last stick was a 2005 BMW X3 3.0. Since then we've had a 2005 A6, a 2008 X3, an Infiniti 2011 FX35, a 2009 Audi A4, a 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD and now a 2014 S4 and SQ5. In this (the examples of the cars we've owned) one way, our buying probably represents more of what most ""real"" people actually buy. Although I would argue that those who buy Audi's S and RS cars and BMW's M's, and Mercedes AMG's no matter how poshed-up, may not be the manufacturers' main, or primary customers. If BMW 3 series cars really have fallen out of favor with many of their previous customers, I would agree (with whoever posted this idea) that for every ""die hard Bimmer-file"" that leaves the fold, several new to the fold customers come on-board. Ditto the message for Audi and Mercedes -- lose 1, gain 5 (or whatever the number might be). There were die-hard horse and buggy customers -- back in the day -- too. Giddy-up?"

These days, VW is the only show in town, and their reliability (yeah, I know . . . I should be prepared to tolerate ""breathtakingly expensive"") is somewhat suspect. What I'd like is a BMW 320 or 325 diesel with a manual transmission, since they've not yet discontinued RWD -- they're available in the thousands outside of the CARB-driven North American market. As a second choice, I could deal with an Audi A3 diesel with a manual. Or, I could go piss up a rope. What I want isn't available, so I continue to tolerate what I can get. I presently drive an Acura TSX from the pre-beak era with a very nice manual transmission that drives the wrong set of wheels. It's been stone-reliable (well, there was the blower motor issue that I dealt with a month or so ago) for the whole time I've driven it (approaching 100K miles), but I've never forgiven Acura for not bringing in the diesel TSX that was promised for the model year following my purchase of the gasser that I drive. Guess what -- they couldn't meet CARB. I drove my first modern diesel in Europe 13 years ago and have been waiting ever since for the opportunity to buy one here. I'm getting older by the day.

What they DO find objectionable is BMW's current penchant for making their cars bigger, heavier, and more insulated from the driving experience. As I've noted before, I've spent considerable seat time in several F10s and F30s and I find my son's 2004 X3 and my Mazdaspeed 3 to be far more involving drives. BMW is coming in second or third in many magazine comparisons, and their novocain-infused steering and poor ride/handling balance are a major reason for their poor showing."

If I drove one and it was my 1st time ever driving a BMW, I wouldn't lust after it and WANT it like I did when I first drove my friend's 1995 E36 325is (SP - MT).

Of this total, the cargo volume is 12.5 cu ft. **Meaning that the passenger volume for the Civic is 94.6 cu ft. ** Even the Civic is larger inside the passenger cabin than the 2015 TLX by 1.3 cu ft. It is important to note that the 2014 Accord provides 119 cu ft of interior volume. This is more than 10 cu ft more than the 2015 TLX that only has 107.6 in the Advance model. I assume the interior will be nicer than a civic, but I think my interest in the TLX has just died. I'm sure there are pros and cons about this, but I think I'm going to pass."

It also had a suspension designed for something other than isolation from the road and an excellent 6-speed manual.

Probably the way it's packaged with useable space, will be as big or bigger than the current Accord. You really have to look at the entire picture. Packaging efficiency makes a big difference in passenger comfort/room. My wife really wanted one of the last TSXs. There just weren't many on dealer's lots, and she felt the TL was too big.

3891,"July 10, 2014  3:07PM",markcincinnati,"As nice as the Accord may be, and even including the fact that the Honda is somewhat larger factored in, too, well, the TLX will offer PAWS and SH-AWD. These features put the TLX into another performance category (and the TLX will also offer an 8-speed transmission and a ""sport tuned"" suspension.) Folks that shop for Acuras do so, I think, because they don't want a Honda (hence Acura's efforts to distance the Acura lineup from Honda products as much as the corporate checkbook will tolerate). These two cars aren't really competitive [with each other] if you axed me. The new TLX, I would assume will end up being in comparison tests with the Infiniti Q50S AWD and the Lexus IS350 AWD, to name just two. The Infiniti and the Lexus may have an initial advantage since they are -- ""foundationally"" -- based on RWD chassis. Of course, I wouldn't count out the impact of the PAWS and SH-AWD technology making for perhaps a more interesting showdown. Certainly these cars will want to be included in the same sentences with a BMW 3 and even the somewhat aging A4/S4 family, but I do believe the TLX will work like crazy to position itself as the alternative vehicle (alternative to the Infiniti and Lexus, to be sure). I'll end where I began, the Acura TLX, perhaps for the first time in years, seems to have distanced itself more from the [Honda] Accord. I'll be so nutz as to suggest these two cars will rarely be cross shopped (other than perhaps the BASE FWD TLX vs the Accord). Often wrong, never uncertain, I remain."

Not an ELLPS, but he ended up buying a manual Focus. One of the advantages we sold him on was that he wouldn't likely have to be the bad guy when non-vehicle owning students wanted to borrow his car.

Funny that you would say that. I have read Q50 forums that complain about the technology problems - essentially ""not ready to be marketed"". 30 seconds for the backup camera to come one; no lines on the backup camera. Come on - I think these things are standard equipment on a Toyota corolla!

My wife's FX, on the other hand had the ""all-around-view"" monitor -- now THAT's valuable tech and sadly is only available on BMW's and Audi's of a certain model and/or with a special (high cost) driver assistance package. I did test drive the X3 with the top view monitor and it was about 90% as good as the Infiniti -- and of course was breathtakingly expensive compared to the Infiniti. Interesting ""opinion"" from Bob Lutz in the current R&T magazine in response to a question posed to him essentially wondering why German cars are often held up as the zenith of automobiles. Lutz essentially gave a response that said something like this: ""German cars used to be at the top, and they still may be, but everyone else can do the same thing as the Germans these days."" I would assume Audi, BMW, Mercedes, Porsche and VW, too, would beg to differ. Although, there is a point there -- when C&D crowns #1 to a Lexus in a comparison article and the BMW 3 series is #2, you know the times they are (at least once) a changin'.

3908,"July  3, 2014  6:29PM",qali,"I have a 2008 TL and a 2013 MDX. The TL does not have lines but a fairly decent rear camera. The MDX has the ""lines"" and 3 views from 2 cameras. Fairly accurate and reliable. However, I still turn my head around to get a wider perspective on what's around. Now, my 2011 335i 2-door does not have a camera but an outstanding proximity sensor system. I find this system more reliable because it audibly warns me of every obstacle on the entire rear side of the vehicle when reversing. Comes in very handy when backing up into my tight garage. Regarding the German vs. Japanese car comparison, both my Acuras are great vehicles and I will not trade them. However, my BMW gives me a smile each time I accelerate around a turn. The interior ergonomics are ""different"" and takes time to learn but the quality of materials and engineering is first rate. Take for example the windshield wipers. BMW perhaps makes one of the best wipers in the business. The rain-sensing wipers have never let me down even during driving in heavy rains at 80-90 mph because the vehicle is designed from the ground up to be driven fast. Same goes for my headlights which are bi-level xenon. With my poor eyesight and sensitivity to glare, the BMW is the only car I take out at night because they make absolutely wonderful auto-dimming exterior and interior mirrors. Even the seat belt assist (who I lovingly refer to by name) has an intelligence to it and does not extend if there is no one in the passenger seat, the door is not closed, or if the car is in Drive. These are subtleties and design elements that still make, in my opinion, the German cars stand out from Japanese counterparts. Sorry for the long post."
3909,"July  3, 2014  8:05PM",wayne21,"I went to dinner last night with a friend in her new Honda civic. The backup camera has lines and the move to adjust to the steering wheel. When the right turn signal is pushed (or when pushing in on the end of the turn signal ""pole"") a camera comes on showing the right side of the car (i.e. blind spot) and that camera also has lines. Interesting that this technology comes standard in the civic. I believe it was a base civic as it had cloth interior and no satellite radio."

I think they're recent expansion into more comfortable, diverse cars is simply an attempt to take market share in other categories.

Here's an excerpt from a post I wrote back in March 2012- after attending my BMW dealer's reception for the introduction of the F30: First Class as usual- valet parking, open bar, all manner of hors d'oeuvres, and a raffle for an iPad3. The new 3er is an attractive piece, but my thoughts were straying to a 2011 135i M Sport over in the Pre-Owned lot. Pathetic story of the evening: I'm looking at 328i Sport Line and a salesman asks me what I think. I tell him that it's nice, but that it is missing a pedal(the car has a slushbox). A guy standing next to him says ""I like automatics- I want to get in the car and not have to do anything."" I told him that if I can't take the car on the track I'm not buying it- and the guy replies, ""I'd never take my car to the track; especially after I spent three hours washing it."" My son(17 at the time, driving a 1975 2002) laughed about ""The Dork"" for the rest of the evening, but all I could do was silently pray: ""Dear Lord, deliver the BMW marque from all poseurs. Cast them all into the Lake of Fire- or even worse, make them drive an Aveo, Festiva, or Yaris for all Eternity."""

The non-enthusiasts will flip their BMWs in a heartbeat and move on to the next ""in"" car that comes along. A company that doesn't have a set of core values to guide them will eventually pay the price.

3931,"June 20, 2014 10:25PM",wayne21,"I plan to wait until the 2015s are out (TLX and Maxima) to seriously car shop, but I was out of town today and stopped by an infiniti and an acura dealership to just check out their cars. Not to test drive them, but was interested in the ease of entry/exit (a very important issue for the wife) and the interior appearance. Infiniti Q50 - nice that the passenger seat elevates! I think wife may be able to get in/out without any difficulty. It was a base model and I thought the interior was fine in spite of the vinyl (I would pay the extra for leather). It's been awhile since I looked at an Altima, but I don't think the Q50s interior was any nicer (maybe not even as nice) than the top of the line Altima. I also didn't understand why there was a spare tire taking up such a large portion of a small trunk in a car that has run-flat tires. But I realize the idea behind the Q50 isn't a ""nice interior"". I had read a number of sites that talked about an odor in the Q50 when left in the heat. I looked at one on the showroom floor (not in the heat) and didn't detect anything. It's a car I could own. Then to the acura dealer just for a look. Looked at the TL with tech package on the floor. I was not impressed. I hope the TLX has a nicer interior. I thought the leather surfaces were nice, but I thought the materials used elsewhere on the interior were pretty cheap - a lot of hard plastic! The passenger seat elevated which was nice to see, but it seemed that in elevating the passenger seat it would be a bit harder to get in and out (harder than the Q50). I think it was the layout of the dash that forced me to move the seat all the way back to get it in that may make it hard for my wife to get in/out. Will wait until seriously shopping and have the wife try it out in the TLX. I am no fan of dealerships adding things to the car and this particular dealership adds about $3,000 to each sticker. I may be off by the individual numbers, but it was $500 for theft marking (if someone steals my car I don't want it back!), $700 to wax the car and spray the interior with scotch guard (I prefer turtle wax ice sealant and my own scotch guard - about $15 for both - and unlike the high school kid working for them that doesn't care about my car, I will do a good job and not miss anything), $750 for wheel locks, mud guards and a rubber mat in the trunk (a mat I wouldn't want in my car) and some other overpriced stuff I wouldn't be interested in and wouldn't pay for. I would pass on the car before paying for any of those things. If I had to choose between the two, it was a no-brainer. It would be the Q50. I don't think I would even be interested in the TL. But once the TLX and maxima are out I'll seriously shop. Just one person's opinion... the guy that's going to pay for it. Not trying to step on anyone's toes or insult anyone. My wife is most interested in something that not everyone has. We bought a Toyota venza in 2010 and that was one of the reasons for purchasing it (as well as incredibly easy entry/exit for her). The people two doors down from us bought the same green venza. At church, we have 4 green venzas and 1 white venza (ours and the white one are the only 6 cylinders) and 3 of the green venzas (1 of which is ours) park side by side at the church (handicap parking)!"
3932,"June 22, 2014  2:50AM",sweendogy,"Wayne21- the dealer add on to sticker in my experience has been on newer well wanted cars- I would doubt the acura dealer would purposely add massive fluff to an acura TL, and if they did you could call bluff pretty easy because fact is acura is not selling many TLs. Good luck with the search, church and Vensa."
3933,"June 26, 2014  8:58PM",markcincinnati,"wayne21: I very much enjoyed most of the experience of owning an 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance. I had added the rear parking sensors and the ""factory"" splash guards to the car and I, to this day, call my TL, my ""Honda S4"" or my ""Acura S4"" -- the car must've come with 3-bent wheels, which may be the reason I thought the brake rotors were warped and had them turned three times (all under warranty). Once the wheels were replaced (with a 50% credit from Acura), the car was smooth and the brakes didn't chatter or feel warped in any way. I got the idea to call the TL my ""Acura S4"" not from an original thought, but from an Automobile test report where the S4 and the TL were compared even though the report observed most folks would probably NOT cross shop the two cars (they were some $11,000 apart, too -- the Audi was more expensive, of course). I got tired of the Acura feeling about 90% of what I had hoped it would be -- which is actually a compliment considering I was comparing it to a car that was about 25% more money. In any case, my Audi dealer (who is also an Acura dealer, go figure) made me a deal I couldn't refuse once he found out I had ordered a new Lexus IS350AWD F-Sport. Bought out the Acura lease (less than a year to go as I recall) and gave me a discount of 6% off the sticker of a new S4 configured exactly as I wanted it. At the same time, my wife's Infiniti (2011 FX) was also coming off a 39 month lease and, yes, you guessed it, the Audi dealer (also an Acura dealer) is also an Infiniti dealer and once they got wind of my wife's tap dancing with a new BMW X3, made her an offer on a new Audi SQ5, that she couldn't refuse. During our shopping adventure, we test drove the daylights out of all the usual (and some unusual) suspects. I oh so wanted the Q50S/AWD to be the ""it"" car for the 2014 MY. It was good, maybe almost very good -- but for the money that I had to pay for the 2014 S4 I ended up with, I couldn't do it. BTW, probably not gonna make any friends, but I think I'd rather have the Q50/S than the 3 serires BMW we tried. In any case, I want to be supportive of your pre-decision to go with the new '15 TLX SH-AWD, the Acura's can still make (for me) a pretty good value case, even if they are kind of an ""S4 lite."""
3934,"June 26, 2014  9:44PM",wayne21,"Thank you, markcincinnati. I'm looking forward to the TLX coming out. Our neighbor just bought a BMW 330i with sport package. We alternate driving when we go out together and my wife doesn't like the car because it sits too low, rides too rough (rigid) and she thinks the interior is cheap (leatherette). I have owned a number of European cars (two while stationed there and two while living in the US) and I swore I'd never own another (frequent and high maintenance costs). We've been taking a lot of trips and will get serious about buying when we return from our trip to Maine in August. I think we're leaning toward Q50, TLX, maxima or murano, but my wife is likely to throw a curveball and pick something totally different. It is good to get honest feedback (educated) from people who own these cars, though."

With Acura you get Honda reliablity and 80-90% of the experience. I had an Audi and loved it but got rid of it sooner than most any other car. I have my Acura at 140K and it's been very reliable but I still miss the Audi..."

3938,"June 27, 2014  6:32PM",markcincinnati,"The words reliable and durable do give my wife and me pause -- but, gulp, we went ahead and bought our first car EVER, the SQ5. I leased the S4, but with the intention of buying it off lease -- we'll see how the word durability holds up to time and miles. With respect to reliability, however, I would have to say my European cars have not lacked reliability, but the longest I ever kept one was 66,000 miles (a 2005 Audi A6), so I am probably not the poster boy to tout European reliability. My negative reliability experiences all have had to do with American cars -- and mostly Chrysler cars, at that. The thing is, as ""unreliable"" as the American cars proved to be, well, it was pretty close to impossible to KILL one of them -- so I guess I would say I've had unreliable, yet durable cars -- and I thought, at one point, ""why can't I have both?"" Sit down: Then I bought a brand new AMC ""American Eagle"" -- my first AWD car (pre Audi, if you can believe it -- but I am, after all 62 years old). Holy cow, talk about a rolling pile of junk -- if it wasn't welded on, it fell off. The brakes were ""same day"" affairs -- but the thing had a plaid cloth interior and a really cool steering wheel (leather wrapped). And, hey, it WAS AWD (I assume, after all, it was a Jeep with an AMC Concorde body mashed on the frame) and it would go where no one has gone before in all kinds of weather. This was pre-trail rated, but -- idiot that I was -- I took it soft roading and had no fear going at least a little bit off road, too. Taking it into the dealer was a real treat, too -- something was always needing to be salved with money. I couldn't wait to be able to afford an Audi -- got my first FWD one in 1977 a 1978 5000. Anyway, I guess I am at a point where I really do expect, nay, demand both reliability and durability -- I get your desire for the same and hence your conclusion to go Acura or Infiniti. I'll echo, somewhat, the above statement by quoting my wife who I asked ""why not get another Infiniti -- the thing has been trouble free?"" Her reply: ""Infiniti ain't got no soul."" In short: ""Cutty says 'e can't hang!"" (Airplane -- jive talk scene) http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=jive Told you I'm old."
3939,"June 27, 2014  7:24PM",cdnpinhead,"Durability kicks in well after the warranty expires; the truly durable cars are owned by people who eventually get tired of not being able to find replacement parts because the car has been out of production for 10 or 15 years. My Datsun 510 was one of these, so I ended up with a Miata. Not such a bad outcome. This is a concept lost on the majority of people who post here (or anywhere else)."

It didn't have a lot of miles on it when I got it and it didn't have a lot of miles on it when I got rid of it, but it spent plenty of time getting little things fixed. My second assignment to Germany saw me getting a 318i. Great little car until it learned that I'd pay for electronic repairs. It seemed to have a mind of its own and loved to have little things fixed. In the US, I had 2 diesel rabbits (made about 50 miles from my hometown) and perhaps because they were ""diesel"" they provided a license to steal when they went to the shop. Lots of little things that nickel and dimed me to death. I won't even go into the UAW-built cars I have owned. I will not even consider buying a car built by the UAW. Since going Japanese, I have been most happy. Very reliable! I think I'm going to stick with Japanese. My wife wants to ""step up"" a notch and thus the look at Infiniti and Acura.

To be honest, I can handle just about anything (other than European or UAW-built), but will buy whatever she likes. I'm pretty sure it will be Japanese."
3941,"June 27, 2014  8:41PM",m6user,"In 2007, when looking for a car for my wife to commute in, I was down to a Jetta and the Mazda6. I have a nephew that is a VW tech and not a lightweight tech either. He was recruited from a dealership in Maryland to a huge dealership in a midwest city complete with all moving expenses and and nice up front bonus. I had no idea that auto mechanics had these kinds of opportunities. Anyway, I asked him if it were him which one would he choose and he asked me how long I planned on keeping the car. I told him if we liked the vehicle we usually kept a car for 6-7 years. He told me without a doubt get the Mazda or I would be a frequent visitor to the repair shop after warranty and it wouldn't be cheap. I think with his many years of experience he knew what he was talking about and took his advice. Her car has been absolutely trouble free for 7 years and 109k. Not a dime on repairs, just normal maint. Oh, I take that back.....I've replaced two light bulbs."
3942,"June 27, 2014  8:50PM",flightnurse,"I think people confuse reliability with normal wear and tear items. If people plan on keeping care for years then spending money on routine maintenance will cost. My E46 3 series had no issues of reliability but I also made sure the services were kept up to-date. Right out of College, I went to work for Sony, I had bought a MB 300SDL (used) as my business car (yeah it was an over kill) and ended up turning into a Demo car for Sony car audio products. I bought the car with 36K miles on and after 10 yrs sold it with 225K miles on it. That car was stone reliable, but it was taken in to the dealer for it's services according to the maintenance book that was provided by MB. Three issues with the car after 100K where covered by MB because of known problems would be the only black eye I had with the car. I believe if you follow the recommended service for cars you wont have issues, granted I lost count of how many window regulators had to be replaced on the MB,."
3943,"June 27, 2014  9:42PM",wayne21,"I, too, am a firm believer in preventative maintenance. In addition to what the factory suggests, I change oil & filter ever 4k miles, I flush the cooling system annually, I flush power steering fluid every 2 years, etc, etc, etc. I just got tired of little electrical things constantly being in need of repair, windshield seals leaking (VW), alternators going bad, relay switches going out, fan motor going out, etc."
3944,"June 27, 2014 10:27PM",m6user,"I don't think many are confused between routine wear and tear vs. unexpected or repetitive repairs. Everyone knows oil has to be changed, brakes wear out, tires need replacing, etc."

Aside from that I just service the car according to the SI system, except that I change the brake fluid every six months when the car sees the track. And of course it has consumed several sets of EHP tires... I am never selling it."
3946,"June 28, 2014  3:03PM",graphicguy,"I have an awful lot of respect for the UAW. At one point in my life, I was a UAW member. They work hard, long hours, with pride. Go to the Corvette factory or the Jeep factory, and you'll see that all day, every day. Have they outlived their usefullness? Perhaps, particularly given their inability to affect the recent automotive crisis (not sure they could have if they wanted to). I love BMWs (x3). I love Acuras (x3), too. They're my two favorite brands. BMWs have robust drivetrains with many times sublime suspensions. They can and do cost more to maintain over time (first four years are covered, which means you have to deduct those maintenance fees in your equation). After that, you keep that maintenance up, and they car be reliable over a long period of time. Those charges are more than what I've experienced on an Acura. Acuras will be reliable, for a long period of time, with little in the way of maintenance (certainly much cheaper than after warranty maintenance on a BMW). Can't say one is better made than the other. Both have high quality materials. Both brands are great in my estimation....for different reasons. Choice is good, though."
3947,"June 28, 2014  4:37PM",wayne21,My issue with the UAW is the 5 UAW-built vehicles I bought. Bought them while in the service (retired military) thinking it was patriotic. Now believe it was stupidity that took me back to purchase another disaster. I now look at it a bit differently and think of it like this: IF I dated a woman and it was a disaster I probably wouldn't want to date her four sisters one after the other. Perhaps wisdom does come with age.

The new Chevy Impala as well as Malibu are lights years ahead in the cars they replace. The same with the Ford Fusion. Some of the blame really needs to go with the companies since they allowed those poorly built cars to leave the factory.

Man I should of bought that car, infact I extend the lease 4 extra months because I had no ideas what to get next. 03- wanted a 6 with a 6- few options - considered Cl, thing Mazda had the 6, wanted a 330 but inflated price, went with jetta gli. Car while very attractive with heated cloth sports seats and nice rims had issue ps with monsoon radio as it had a passenger volume bias that drove me insane at times. Went back to dealer 10 times in 3 years for non-oil changes. Car was purchased at a good deal and after 4 yr warrantee was up I was quick to exchange at good value for the loved Infiniti g.- at the end was very worried I would spend a lot of time at VW. 07- g35x - great car- sure it was now an auto, and a bigger sedan but with the power and yhe tech could not be beat at the time, considered many others but nothing compared at the cost. Had the car for 7 model years, went back for brakes, bought new tires and had a issue with the window seals- at the end I also had it back for a drive train belt that snaped on way to work, car was towed and work done at dealer for a cost around 200 bux. Best car you could own- but at the end I thought with the tech and power it was a good idea to move on. Audi 13 s4 - 17k or so - I've owned for 3500 miles no issues yet- but knowing the costs and brand I will be monitoring and deciding around warrantee time on next move.

3959,"June 30, 2014  8:46PM",markcincinnati,"Other than the easy answer: Marketing or Money, why can't we upgrade our cars telematics and other electronic items? I don't know if you know this, but Audis come with a pretty neat technology called ""Audi Connect."" It is provided at no charge for 6 months then it is simply shut off if you don't elect to subscribe to it (at $30 per month or the equivalent of $15 per month for a $450 lump sum payment). Audi connect through 2014 MY's utilizes T-Mobile as a carrier to provide Internet connectivity and the ability to turn your car into a WiFi hotspot. Using Audi connect and apparently some neat software from Google, many desirable features are offered that are probably worth up to $15 per month on a month-to-month payment plan. The thing is the carrier is T-Mobile. I can't begin to tell you how poor T-Mobile is -- and when it is at full-strength, it is 3G, very slow and often drops down to 2G, and, well, has very poor signal coverage here in our River City. Sitting right on the showroom floor, however, is a new Premium+ A3 with 4G LTE AT&T Audi connect. It fires right up, goes about 3 or 4 times faster and is quicker to start-up to boot. So Audi calls me and wants me to re-up my Audi connect plan -- I do offer $15 per month paid monthly, not $450 in one lump -- IF I can swap out the simm card or the radio itself, for a new carrier -- AT&T would be fine, so would Verizon. Now I do understand that you may be loving T-Mobile if you're in certain areas of the US. But what may be good in Baltimore sucks in Cincinnati from a phone coverage, speed and drop-out perspective. I've had Sprint, Verizon and AT&T (currently with AT&T since I got off my BlackBerry -- which was RIMM wasn't it?) The only service I've ever had any issues with is, you guessed it T-Mobile. You'd think there is a little radio device behind the face of the dashboard that is, after all, a cell-phone. Just like when I got rid of the BlackBerry and went with the iPhone (and changed service providers), there ought to be a way to swap out the tech -- not buy a whole new car for pity's sake. My friend has a private plane -- the thing must be a million years old, but ""the avionics"" are as current as can be just as the engine and the whole plane are ""overhauled"" annually to keep them ""jus like new"". It seems to me that the electronic features of these cars hits the showroom floor one generation behind (sometimes more); wouldn't you win friends (and customers) and influence people if you could market your cars as having the ability to be kept current (at least insofar as some ""electronic"" systems are concerned?) I probably answered my own question, the reason these systems are not ""allowed"" to be updated with new tech has to do with marketing and money not feature and function. I'd re-up for Audi connect in a heartbeat -- but not with T-Mobile as the service provider; what are you nuts?"

On the other hand I violently agree with your right to your opinion and your right (unless someone here at Edmund's objects) to say it long and loud.

Audi put a better tire on the A3 in sport package, but the 228i was quicker. Then add $375 for the aftermarket plug and play stage 1 and the other two cars will have to sit on the porch and watch, 0-60 in 4.9 second (stock), that is .7 second slower then the M235i, and I'm guessing with the stage 1 added, the difference between the two would be VERY close.. Add better (stickier) tires, then the 228i would be a great alternative to the M235i."

The acura TLX is one that I've been waiting for, but have recently had some concerns. Although not a scientific sample, I've spoken to 8 people who own the TL (2007 - 2012), TSX (2010 - 2014) and MDX (2014). I had read a lot of people complaining about one issue with their acuras and it seems they have the same problem as the accord - wind noise (that is one of the reasons I bought a Toyota in 2010 instead of another accord - wind noise). Every one of the people I spoke to said they had wind noise from the windows. Is this a fluke or is this representative of what I can expect if I buy an acura?"

3980,"June 13, 2014  1:54AM",wayne21,"Thank you, sweendogy. I had seen those sights before when googling wind noise and acura. My wife doesn't want another Toyota (we have a 6 cyl venza) or Honda (had an accord). I had a 2000 accord and it had tons of wind noise. In 2005, I looked at an accord (knowing about wind noise) and the wind noise was very obvious to me on each one we test drove so we bought a ford. In 2010, I test drove a couple accords and could hear wind noise on the test drives (ez to do when you actively listen for it) so we bought a Toyota. I have test driven and ridden in a few new accords (close friend has a 2014) and can hear the wind noise (my friend hears nothing). Wife doesn't want another ""car that everyone else has"" so I thought we'd step up. I know a number of people with acuras and when I ask them about wind noise they all say yes it is noticeable, but tolerable. I'm not interested in hearing wind noise. I'd think Honda could figure out how to build cars without wind noise. Cars I'm considering - Acura TLX (agree on the first year model thing, but thought it to be a worth a look - just the wind noise issue associated with acuras/hondas), Infinit Q50 (don't care for the option packages I have to buy to get what I want), and the pending 2015 maxima (a significant update that I don't know much about, but my wife likes the looks of the car). I might even consider a Hyundai genesis sedan. The venza runs great and we're not in a hurry, but if the right ""upscale"" car comes along I'd buy it. (Car buying is a ""two vote"" for us - with no pressure to sway a vote so I think I'll wait to at least look at a maxima before buying, but I'm not sure when they're coming out - I think Sept."
3981,"June 13, 2014  2:14AM",stickguy,"well, only way to tell for sure is drive one and see. I think this is something that is very subjective though. I have a new style RDX, and notice no wind noise. I also never noticed any on my 2005 Odyssey, 2005 Accord, or 2000 TL (still have that one). about the only noise is tire noise on certain surfaces, but I never considered that objectionable even on bad pavement. maybe not quite as tomblike as a Camry or Lexus, but far from driving an old Wrangler with a loose top!"

3985,"June 15, 2014  3:14PM",roblaw,
3986,"June 15, 2014  3:28PM",roblaw," The Genesis is a very quiet car and the 2015 Genesis is probably quieter still. But you have to know what you want. The TLX is likely to be sportier than a Genesis. The new Genesis is a full on luxury car with a premium interior and wonderful seats. It handles well but I will bet the TLX will be tidier, if for no other reason than it is will smaller and Honda has a good rep for tidy handling cars. The Genesis It is going to weigh probably 400+ lbs. more than a TLX is you compare the 3.5 TLX to a 3.8 Genesis. It is probably almost a foot longer. I will bet the TLX will handle better, be faster, be pretty quiet and get much better fuel economy (and front wheel drive will be better in bad weather as compared to the RWD Genesis unless you purchase the AWD model which will cost more and have even worse mileage). It really depends on what you want and what you are willing to spend. Also, as great a car as the new Genesis is, its resale will probably be lower than the TLX because of the perception of Hyundais and the price (probably comparable to the TLX when comparably equipped). This will affect the overall cost of the vehicle whether you buy and hold or lease and dump. So drive a lot of cars and try to ignore preconceived notions, as hard as that is. I think Acura/Honda is coming back from its worst years and probably still makes excellent cars. Hyundai also makes fine cars today (remember the 1986 Excel?). There is an amazing array of great cars in the TLX/Genesis price range that meet a wide variety of needs. Good luck with your purchase."
3987,"June 15, 2014  4:24PM",wayne21,Thanx roblaw. I think we're going to wait until the TLX and the new maxima are available before we make a decision. We're in our 50s and retired and I'm not really concerned about the cost or resale. I am more concerned with getting what we want and I think that after looking at these cars we'll have a better idea for what we want. It is good to get honest feedback from people who have driven these cars though.
3988,"June 16, 2014  1:51AM",sweendogy,"@wayne21 - enjoy retirement - good for you not worried about resale- I will say I recently saw a v6 genesis, the 2015 version on the road and was impressed by its looks and stance. If you are looking for something comfy this could be something to consider."

3990,"June  6, 2014 12:32PM",dino001," In other, words people buy what they want. They don't care if other people don't think that ""it"" is worth the price. Conversely, other people cannot even comprehend why somebody would buy something like filltheblank because there is another filltheblank just as good (in their eyes, anyway) and cheaper. And it's all good. There is another type of discussion we have here constantly - does filltheblank belong to ELLPS? Honestly, I don't really understand why people get so worked up if it does, or does not. Many people would cross shop cars that are not the same ""category"", so what... The line will always be blurred and they move. Yesterday's luxury is today's standard. Yesterday's benchmark of sportiness (like manual transmission) is becoming so rare that it's impossible to use as an actual measuring stick. Prices go up incessantly, so yesterday's 30K car is today's 40K. And so on. If somebody cross shops Ford Focus ST or Subaru WRX/STI with BMW 328i and somebody else cross-shops Lexus ES (not even IS) with same BMW, who am I to say they are ""wrong"" about looking at them? They'll choose what they like at the end, it may not be ELLPS, but who cares. I say something much more revolutionary - ELLPS is dead, there is no ELLPS. There is bunch of former ELLPS, but they got so diverse that it's too wide. Some lost ""Entry Level"" pricing (long time ago, I might say), others lost performance, others went beyond ""Entry Level"" luxury. Then bunch of outsiders got to the 0-60 and horsepower game, keeping to horses on front wheels, but hey, it's still 250+ horses. There is also a small breed of AWD (some are FWD) bandits that are ""too small"" or don't have enough ""stuff"", but 30 years ago ""real"" ELLPS were just their size, had lesser 0-60, slalom time, crank windows, cloth seats and nobody was ranting they were no ELLPS. Just saying..."
3991,"June  6, 2014  5:05PM",flightnurse,"Mid last year on a flight from Detriot to Miami my seatmate struck up a conversation with me regarding cars (I have all of the car mag's on my iPad.) His questions were odd, but focused. He asked what kind of car I had, when I told him none at moment, asked why, and if I'm in the market for a car. After about 20 minutes I asked him what he did. Come to find out he works for Intellishop, then we started talking about mystery shoppers and such. He asked if I would be interested in being a mystery shopper, but declined, but knew someone who would, Rick. We talk about him and my seatmate was happy. So for the past year Rick been a mystery shopper for Intellishop, this is where the testing of cars come from. It's been interesting so far the Kia K900 and E350 have been standouts, maybe not in the way you think. K900 is a home run, but the biggest issue is getting people who can afford a $66K car to come into the dealer or think about Kia. E350, the saleman was the worst but the car he showed us was absolutely stunning, the color combo worked on the car. That is the only positive thing Rick said about the whole MB experience. We weren't even offered a test drive, and haven't driven a E class in several years I was looking forward to it. In regards to cross shopping, the Kia dealer ask this when we looked at the Cadzena and K900, no other dealer ask this question. The interesting thing about Intellishop is you have a ""script"" already going into the dealership, and a certain car to look at. At the MB dealer, we had to look at the E350 ""gas"" so the new E350 Bluetec was out of the question, but really want to test drive this car... This whole debate on what is and isn't a ELLPS is really a subjective thing, just like in the medical word, pain is a subjective. I had patients who would complain of the worse pain of their life, but couldn't keep theirs eyes open because of the heavy doses of pain medications they were on... I'm with Dino, the ELLPS is dead, since one can buy a $27K hatchback that does 0-60 in the same time as a car that cost twice as much from the homeland."

Rick enjoys it and so do I when I have time to go with him' Perception is everything, but status is another. As I wrote the K900 has everything anyone would want in a luxury car except the name."
3994,"June  6, 2014  7:25PM",sweendogy,"Didn't see you comment on the k900 besides saying it was a home run, but you have to agree Morpheus has a huge point here- which key do you choose flight?  it's like buying watches do you need the Tag if you have 3k when you can get a macys watch for 750 (with coupons less) and that said watch for 750 actually looks and performs better then a 3k tag? They both have the same warrantee - sure the dealer experience could be better at the tag dealer - but most people would rather not spend time at a dealer, unless they are getting paid."
3995,"June  7, 2014  1:02AM",flightnurse,"The K900 is NOT a sports sedan lets get that out first. The K900 (which I really hate the name) was impressive, the 5 liter V8 has plenty of power and has a nice rumble to it, but nothing too loud, just enough to let you know it's there. The 8 spd transmission is the same unit in BMW (but of course gearing and software differences) shifts very smoothly and never had a problem with that. The Kia dealer came to our house with it (this was part of the scrpit from Intillishop) and the salesman (specially trained to sell K900s) was very good explaining the car to us, and he used certain ""key phrases"" when pointing features of the car. So just driving around town, the V8 is right in the smack of it's torque band. Merging onto the freeway the K900 moves well, but not as well as one would think with 420hp. The K900 is not a rocket ship, it can move if needed. Head room, leg room, hip room is bigger then a 5 series, it's more inline with a 7 series, but with a mid level 5 series price tag. The Nappa leather was supple, soft and felt very rich. Fit and Finish was first rate, everything was though of and placed perfectly. IF you are looking for a luxury car not much of a sports sedan then the K900 would be well worth the look. As I stated it is a home run, but not a grand slam...."

3997,"June  7, 2014  2:07AM",sweendogy,Got it- so a k900 is not a sports sedan- it's probably closer to a Lexus ls type of rig.  Is the 320 a luxury sedan then?
3998,"June  7, 2014  5:25PM",flightnurse," I would put the K900 and Equus into the Lexus type vehicle as well as the Genesis and Cedenza. Given how far the Koreans have come and these vehicles are the first of their type, the Koreans studied the play books very well. Now Luxury is subjective, is the 320i as luxurious as say Ricks Genesis, NO. Is the 320i a luxury sedan compared to a Kia Forte, Yes. If someone goes from a Mid-level Atlima SV to a 320i they might say the 320i is more luxurious. I don't think you will ever see BMW ever advertise the 320i as a luxury sedan, even with Premium Package, Nav, Xenon lights, I would call it a Entry Level Luxury sedan. Just as you can't call the Genesis or Cedenza a Entry Level Luxury Sedan. Because of their price."
3999,"June  7, 2014  5:33PM",flightnurse," Absolutely my comment to Sweeny answers this. Kia will have a hard time getting people who own BMW's, Audi's, Lexus and MB to come into their dealership to look at the K900, the perception would be, the K900 isn't to the level of the Germans, but if one looks deep enough they will find out that they are. it would hard for a MB owner to see themselves driving a Kia. I think Kia and Hyundia have a big uphill battle to deal with, it might have been for them to take a play out of Honda, Toyota and Nissan and make a luxury Brand outside of Kia and Hyundia. Mazda was going to have Amati as their luxury brand and didn't go through with it, I think this is why you wont see a 50-60K Mazda, Getting people to spend that kind of money for Mazada will be tough, very tough."

And they are making it hard of themselves by selling cars like Optima, Forte from the same dealership as K900. When people go to a Lexus, BMW, Mercedes or Audi dealership, they except to see only luxury. That's not the case with Kia. I don't think any amount of marketing can change that perception, when you can see cheap Kia cars at the dealership or on the roads. I just checked their website and they are advertising - ""KIA named best VALUE brand for 2014"" - not sure that's the thing luxury car buyers are looking for."

4004,"June  8, 2014  8:33AM",justg0,"For some of the top companies in the world, their brand is basically the most important thing. For e.g., when a consumer buys an Apple product, they expect a certain level of quality and attention to detail, which you will not find in other company products. Take for e.g. Samsung, their main competitor in the cell phone area - even though a Samsung phone may have more features and may seem like a better value for money to lot of people, it just cannot compete with Apple in terms of quality and attention to detail. Samsung uses cheap plastic to make their phones. Apple will never do that. The engineers at Apple spend so much time on each small tine little thing, that when you hold their finished product, you can just feel how good it is. Same holds true for cars, Lexus represents a certain brand, so does Audi and BMW. What brand does Hundai or Kia represent? Even though they may have more features than BMW or Lexus, they just feel cheap, because at their core they are a value brand. And there is no way a Sonata can match BMW in terms of handling or transmission or any of the stuff that makes a car fun to drive. If you care all about HP, then sure there are tons of other cars with that can beat a BMW with similar or lower price tags. You can't avoid the dealership - you need to go their to buy the car and for regular maintenance. I lease my cars, so I am there at least once every 3 years, plus a few times in between. And you can feel the difference between a luxury car dealership vs. a value brand. I totally understand that I am ultimately paying for that experience and I am fine with it. You basically get what you pay for!"

4014,"June  9, 2014  7:32PM",markcincinnati,"The ELLPS Category is More Alive Now Than at Any Other Time in History (Part 1) I’m going to take exception to the suggestion that “ELLPS” as a category is “dead” – indeed, I think it is a very much alive and healthy category/segment; it is almost certainly growing and definitely aspirational category. Both consumers and manufacturers aspire – and often ardently aspire – in their own way to this category in fact. “ELLPS's are like porn, I can’t define them, but I know them when I see them. . .” We can’t go on unless some stipulations are made, and these stipulations are possibly made up of nearly equal parts of fact and opinion (I would agree if you said opinion is weighed more heavily should you be so inclined to make that argument). ELLPS autos are difficult to define – perhaps the [unintentionally ironic, I’m sure] quote above, a derivative of Justice Potter Stewart’s famous remark, “I know it [obscenity] when I see it, and the motion picture involved in this case is not that,"" captures the essence of the problem of figuring out what is and what is not an ELLPS. I think I’ll just go with something like: An ELLPS is an automobile with more basic or “included” content or other “stuff”, one that is generally thought to be of higher quality (another “I know it when I see it” attribute, to be sure) with more “available” comfort/convenience/performance features and amenities, higher style/design attributes (ditto) and noticeably more precise fit and finish (tighter tolerances) than other vehicles that the ELLPS candidate can be measured up against. The dealership experience also bears noting too, as it is, or should be, a cut above, too. The ELLPS is kind of an anomaly (or at least it was), since its creators want us to know it offers both luxury and performance, traits that used to be almost mutually exclusive. Perhaps an ELLPS candidate or incumbent is (or should be) like the tire type we call “Grand Touring”. But, then, even that metaphor falls short these days, as it certainly appears that one of the prices (pun intended) for entry into the 2014 ELLPS class is “higher performance numbers” than even a few short years ago in the 21st century. Maybe, today (for American consumers), the more correct tire metaphor for an ELLPS is “Ultra High-performance All-season”. Of course, we need be mindful of the “S” in ELLPS, which, of course stands for sedan (and I’ll put a stake in the ground that this means 4-doors, despite whatever model names some manufacturer comes up with – thinking of the name “4-door coupé” for instance). Perhaps some attempt to say what is not an ELLPS would be helpful (as would a level setting question or two): A Bentley (any Bentley) is not an ELLPS (I would argue it is not an LPS either), nor is any Porsche (even a Panamera falls outside of even the most liberal definitions of both ELLPS and LPS, if you axe me) or a Hyundai. But does this exclude the somewhat stand-alone models named Genesis and Equus? I think both the Genesis and Equus fall short on their “P” quotients, making them ineligible for either ELLPS or LPS inclusion, but maybe that’s just me and possibly this is a temporary situation – see the latest Car & Driver review of the Genesis sedan now with “suspension tuning by Lotus”). Buicks don’t count either, right? But wait, what about the Regal GS with AWD and a few option boxes checked off – such as most all of the electronic safety nannies so popular with the presumptively bona fide ELLPS members from Germany, Japan (and Sweden)? Does said Regal GS merit an invitation into the hallowed ELLPS category or is it yet too soon to bestow this lofty ~yet perhaps increasingly dubious~ honor?"
4015,"June  9, 2014  7:32PM",rbirns1,"Watches and cars are not a good analogy. A car is for transportation, but has many facets (comfort, performance, features, etc.) that vary greatly from one to another. A watch has just one function, and all watches pretty much handle that function the same. Other that that it's all for show, literally just a piece of jewelry."
4016,"June  9, 2014  7:34PM",markcincinnati,"The ELLPS Category is More Alive Now Than at Any Other Time in History (Part 2) Can any sedan, regardless of pedigree, be inducted (or indicted) into the ELLPS hall of fame if it cannot be had with either RWD or AWD (FWD only cars need not apply); likewise can any sedan that is primarily, obviously and overwhelmingly badge engineered apply for ELLPS or LPS club membership (thinking of the current Lincoln MKZ which screams badge engineered Ford Fusion here)? Hopefully, too, we can stipulate that to be in the ELLPS, even with all of the MSRP bracket-creep we’ve seen these past few years, that there is a “size component” we should probably consider. For example, even though today’s BMW 3 is pretty darn close in size to yesterday’s 5, we will accept a 3 series (no matter how pricey) as a member of the ELLPS clan in good standing, but we won’t admit any 5 series (even if it is configured to be less expensive – with a 4-cylinder turbo, and option stripped – than a 3 series) because the 5 series is simply too big (at least at this instant in history; and, let’s agree this could change as the 2’s, 3’s and 5’s morph into god knows what next). And for pity’s sake are we going to point to something like the new A3 – which is exactly the same size as an earlier gen A4 – and say, “Nope, you’re not ELLPS, you’re a Premium car.” Personally, I’d exclude the A3 from the club, perhaps calling it an Entry-level ELLPS instead. But, that would be just plain silly. Yet, for discussion purposes, I’m not sure I want to be engaging in conversations with those who aren’t interested in, ahem, “The right kind, or our kind” [of car] – you know, allowing them in here just might make the conversations even messier and perhaps occasionally, er, ""from time-to-time"", even more pugnacious and xenophobic than they are already (if that’s even possible). So we’re left with [my] belief [and maybe yours too] that the American automobile consumer is faced with a segmented market (one that is growing more so all the time). Perhaps there are divergent opinions on this that follows: Virtually every car manufacturer on the planet wants to have cars that are in the ELLPS and LPS class – and granted ELLPS can mean different things for folks in Beijing and Buffalo. The reason for this LPS-Lust is simple: Premium compacts (like the new A3), ELLPS’s (like the Lexus IS 350 F-Sport) and LPS’s like the Mercedes E-class, etc. are where the profit margins soar. No wonder Hyundai (and KIA) are, with each successive generation, pushing hard, harder, hardest to be members of the Acura (for now), Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Infiniti, Lexus, Mercedes and possibly Volvo Club. Why? So they can raise prices, natch. Remember the Lexus playbook (bring in a car -- and give it a ""number"", not a name: LS400 -- that apparently has 100% of the Mercedes content down-pat and sell it at 75-80% of the price of the Merc)? The only thing that might be the “yes but” for the Korean’s is that they’re trying to become ELLPS and LPS club members without separate, purpose-built dealerships – this admittedly cost and time saving approach may ultimately not sit well with the ELLPS and LPS cognoscente or even the general car consuming hoi polloi; yet, the only person I know who has an Equus says the dealership experience has been superlative. For now, we need not – here – concern ourselves with discussions or comparisons to the really high-end cars (like the Bentley mentioned above or other super-luxury brands from foreign lands). At this point in time, we’ve got some really interesting cars to discuss and an upcoming pipeline that is exemplified by Car & Driver’s recent article “25 Cars Worth Waiting For”. The ELLPS category is more alive now than at any other time in history. At least that’s the way I see it. Often wrong, never uncertain, I remain."
4017,"June  9, 2014  7:47PM",stickguy,"Mark, I disagree about the blanket exclusion of FWD. And I guess it is clear you require brand snobbery as part of the criteria, as opposed to being based on purely function."
4018,"June  9, 2014  8:37PM",markcincinnati,"I think disagreement regarding FWD is a good thing. I have had many -- or at least ""several"" FWD cars from US and German mfgrs over the years and I found them worthy of many things, perhaps even inclusion into the ELLPS and LPS rank and file. Funny, sort of, it used to be that 4-cylinder motivated cars need not apply. Well, my my my how things have changed. I'd be (I've been) proud and pleased to have a 4-cylinder BMW or Audi and probably I'd be fine with an ATS with a 4-cylinder motivator too. Right now, today, at this instant, however, I believe FWD vehicles need not apply -- regardless of how you and I may feel and think about the subject. I think the bias, right now, against FWD is so strong it may be ""stronger than dirt""! Evidence the Genesis ""brand"" -- Genesis eschewed anything but RWD for the first generation, now with the new ones, they're offering up both RWD and AWD in the 6-cylinder version and promised AWD in the 8 ""soon"". FWD, currently and based on much that I read here and by the pros is like an embarrassing tattoo you got one night when you were ""not quite right"" for some reason. You're working on getting rid of it ASAP, but these things take time. On the other hand, who knows, the benefits (and there are many) of FWD may win out after all. Just remember that FWD was initially put in cars to make them cheaper (to make and buy). There is, for some, a stigma associated with ""FWD"" cars that aspire to be in the Premium, ELLPS, LPS, High-end luxury or Super luxury class. Same holds true for sports cars, super cars and exotics -- they are (or must be to not be posers) RWD or AWD. Mercedes did bring out the CLA as FWD, to be sure -- and there is some risk there (but it can be had with AWD); the A3 is also FWD (like most Audi models) and offers up AWD. At this point ALL incoming inventory for the A3's (here in Cincinnati) will be quattros. That may change. The ATS and CTS were rendered from the get-go as RWD (with AWD available) because that is what is (NOW, today) expected. Luxury may or may not = ""Snobbery"". We're talking, here, on this forum, about some variation of a type that contains the words: Luxury, Performance, Sedan -- entry level or not. Luxury is beyond (above? beside? below? -- pick one) being based on ""pure function"", I think is safe to say. Luxury means to most of us, I assume, ""stuff"", features, amenities, capabilities, levels of refinement beyond what is ""basic"", beyond what is strictly necessary. If you think this equates to brand snobbery, even if I conceded (personally) your point, even if I 100% agreed with you, this is the place where ""we"" are going to discuss, debate, and perhaps even politely argue about luxury cars (that happen to also be capable of a decent amount of ""high"" performance). So yes, brand snobbery is ""a"" criteria for this discussion, just not necessarily ""my"" criteria to be a member of ""the club"". However, I can somewhat sense saying ""If the shoe fits"" isn't an inappropriate thought. I saw a very long and impressive video about the Chrysler 300C when it first came out -- and the Chrysler engineers involved in rendering this fine car kept comparing it to an Audi A8. I love the 300C, especially the ones with the refreshed interiors and AWD, but Senator, ""I've known A8's and you ain't no Audi A8."" The point is, we -- here -- are but PART of the market -- and we may disagree with the overall market's standards and definitions (and they keep changing all of the time) -- but we need to recognize, I think, the prevailing trends, ideas and standard-bearers. I'm operating under the assumption that this ELLPS forum is one of the places to be able to discuss certain brands and not have to apologize that they aren't in a more hoi polloi category in a manner of speaking."

After 1 track event where the car was plagued by overheating, I added a custom larger oil cooler and downpipes (thought maybe deleting the cats from so close to the engine could help with heat). But then the vanos solenoid problems began. While on my 3rd set of those, the car started making some very disturbing but faint noises from down deep within, so I gave up, quickly removed the downpipes and tuner, and traded her in. Total ownership period was 18 months. With the JB4 by itself, I think they were claiming 340-350 hp, IIRC. With the DPs, it should have been somewhere in the 370hp range.

Not that I blame the mods... guilt by association, I guess. My biggest challenge with the stang is traction. Even with the widest summer tires I could squeeze on the stock wheels (255s), it just smokes them at will. I would LIKE to do the BAMA tune, which is cheap and easy (OBD2 interface for under $400) and adds a fair bit of power for an NA engine (claimed 31hp/37tq) along with a pair of Outlaw mufflers ... but it all has to wait. Wider wheels should be first on the list and I don't have the $$ to spare at the moment with the family vacation looming in August. BUT, we are way off topic. haha.

4036,"June  4, 2014  9:49PM",markcincinnati,"Miss a Few Days and You Miss a Lot! Well I last posted on May 29. Whew! I think I am finally caught back up on the reading of the many -- mostly very good -- posts. I have some take-aways that comes from speed-reading about 60 posts AFAP: Talking with specificity about cars you haven't driven is like critiquing a movie after only seeing the trailers -- that's a good one, I will be swiping that with great enthusiasm and some frequency. Going on and on about how a 5, 10, 15 year old or older car and proclaiming it is better than the current crop must've been said/written sarcastically or perhaps ironically. Not that everything new is better, but, well as a general rule things (like cars) have tended to be better along with the passage of time. Stick shifts are great, ""no one"" buys them anymore because: see #2. Oh, somewhere I read that even in cars -- like the ELLPS's -- that actually do offer stick shifts, the take-up by actual paying customers continues to shrink and it is something less than 3% or perhaps 2%. Now that I have, in my garage, a 7-speed dual-clutch and an 8-speed tiptronic, I know the reason. If the best of breed 8-speed doesn't ""shift your opinion"" well today's 7-speed dual-clutch certainly will be virtually irresistible. Some folks here will correctly note that they can option load-up a non-ellps car, note that it meets or beats the ""fill-in-the-blank"" ellps in content, performance and the big one, price and apparently end with an implied ""so how 'bout them apples"" or ""so there!"" Continuing: In my experience ""people need those stinkin' badges!"" To make a, or perhaps ""the"" point: My MontBlanc pen uses a 3 or 4-dollar refill, the same one used in some other really ""way less expensive"" (I'll say) pens. In the same spirit, my Tag watch doesn't tell time any better than my $750 Swiss Army Watch I got at Macy's. That's not the point -- well, OK, it may be ONE point, but it's the overall ""certain something"" that makes luxury goods, well, hmm, ""worth more."" Once I get over ""needing"" a white and blue roundel or four interlocking rings, etc, well, I'll get a KIA of some sort. I like coming back after a few days to see how we've advanced the discussion here. I'm really gonna try to test drive more cars, 'cause y'all are BRUTAL! DILYL"
4037,"June  5, 2014 12:10AM",sweendogy,"The value of a money I guess means different things to different people. Acura at one time was a superior value to other lux cars and offered performance- still does-- now the mainstream cars, many of which use the same components as lux siblings cost thousands less and similar performance but I guess should not be compared because of a badge. 750 Macy watch sounds good to me, my timex just broke."
4038,"June  5, 2014  1:35AM",markcincinnati,"I do like, very much, my Victorinox Swiss Army watch -- I think it, in some ways, looks nicer than the Tag. But, the thing is, the Victorinox is not a ""luxury"" watch. A new Malibu LTZ (a very attractive looking car), is also not an Infiniti, Lexus, BMW, Audi, Mercedes -- it even doesn't fit in the same class as the Volvo S60. We're here -- well some of us are -- in ELLPS land perhaps because we ""choose"" not to buy/lease an LPS automobile. Perhaps some of us -- as Alfred Sloan imagined -- would start with a Chevy and aspire to a Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick and ultimately a Cadillac. I suspect Sloan is the father of the term ""aspirational"" as it applied to cars. We're here, I'll bet, because we either aspire to an ELLPS, have an ELLPS and aspire to an LPS or are just car-nuts who know the good stuff comes from Audi, BMW, Infiniti, etc. I was wondering today when the last time I saw a Phaeton was -- years ago is all I could come up with. Saw several A8's today, however. I test drove a Phaeton (way back when) which was seriously discounted and sub-vented (and as a reminder I owned an A8) thinking I could get a ""new A8"" for a fraction of the cost by going with the Phaeton. The Phaeton was, closed eyes, an A8. Same sweeeet 4.2L V8, quattro (well, you know) etc. I just couldn't bring myself to pull the trigger -- probably the biggest bargain I'll ever see. Damn HUGE-[non-permissible content removed] ""VW"" emblem on the thing. Instead of the bargain it probably was, I knew I would be thinking, ""I paid THIS MUCH for a VW?!? What was I thinking?"" You know I still think if you can't or won't go with an S4, the next best thing is the Acura TL SH-AWD Advance (and I assume the TLX is even better). Even my non-car loving friends called my TL ""a Honda."" Slamming the tinny doors was just enough of a confirmation of that notion to remind me that the Acura brand had slipped from Premium status. My wife collects pens -- I have perhaps four or five (that were gifts from her) -- I probably would not go out and buy a new 4-figure MontBlanc, but I do notice when I see Brian Williams use one on the air. My MontBlancs (3 of them) are all the pens I need (one of them broke and I had to send it to Germany to get it fixed -- seems as good as new). My wife must get 6 new pens per year. I sort of get it. Until her current car (the SQ5 Prestige), she liked cars, but wasn't really ""passionate"" about them. Get this, for about 15 minutes she actually considered a Subaru -- which was pretty nice, but kind of trucky and not at all luxurious or even terribly sporty. I knew she would love the price and by the time she needed her second tank of gas would be ""praying for the end of time"" (Meat Loaf). Now, however, she is ""into cars"" and is unlikely to aspire to anything other than an Audi or a BMW -- I can't see reverse aspiration being a viable option (for her or for most people, in fact). Anyway, this collection of ELLPS cars is perhaps the most exciting and ""strokable"" lot in all of cardom. It is here that we see innovation (often before the LPS offerings, even from the same brand), performance and often a huge leap up from even the top of the next lower line. Remember the Phaeton, long live the Phaeton. You know how to drive it . . . ."
4039,"June  5, 2014  2:20AM",m6user,"In other words......you get what you pay for. On paper a decked out Hyundai Sonata Turbo has the power, leather, panoramic moonroof, fancy bells and whistles that most of these ellps have but every switch, piece of leather. undercarriage part, latch, hinge, carpet etc etc is cheap compared to these cars. Other mainstream brands may be a little better but still don't approach the luxury brands. The dealer experience is not the same either. I had an Infiniti and have an Acura but have had tons of non-luxury brands and the dealer experience is much different. Yes, you pay for it but that is my point."

4043,"June  5, 2014  4:26PM",ivan_99, I actually found the rant pretty humorous...it's probably because I'm immature but I have a chuckle when I see people go off
4044,"June  5, 2014  6:37PM",markcincinnati,"Sween, Small correction, I used the term ""strokable"" in my post, I'm not sure how it got translated to ""stokable"" -- I meant, by strokable, cars that are as described in the next post by 'm6user' who continued and gave an additional example of the point. Also it was a rip-off of a Wayne's World throwaway line by Mike Meyers. Also, yes, these are entry-level LPS cars and they can be less expensive than the next step up. However, many if not all of these ellps cars can be easily optioned to numbers beginning with a 5 or a 6. So while it is true that ellps customers -- and want to be customers -- may be somewhat budget minded (since they're not shopping further up the MSRP scale, apparently) folks that shop and buy these vehicles are looking for ""better"" and/or ""more"" and/or a pretty hefty step up in luxury features and perceived quality of materials. OK, the forum is about cars, not other luxury goods -- perhaps the analogies and some poorly written or expressed sarcasm or irony are misplaced. In response to the shopper who configures a Ford Taurus SHO and then remarks the ""fill in the blank"" ellps or lps isn't worth the extra $X-thousands, I had hoped the point would be punctuated by examples in other areas, e.g., outdoor grills, pens and watches. Some folks only buy Rolex's (not me, FWIW) and some see not one bit of extra value in a Rolex when they can have a far less expensive timepiece, etc, etc. Some folks wouldn't pay $1,000 more for an upgraded audio system in their new Mercedes C -- but might spring for the MontBlanc. If someone wants to ""prove"" than a Subaru WRX is the equivalent of or superior to a BMW 335 X-drive, by configuring both ""similarly"" and then citing some performance stats, well have at it. The WRX, for all I know, may actually out-accelerate the Bimmer and so on -- but that doesn't make the Subie an ellps or lps by any stretch. Anyway, if the grills, pens and watches analogies don't track, I'll endeavor to minimize such transgressions. I do not, however know what ""enuf of the better then now stuff"" means. These cars, I think we all mostly agree, are better ""now"" than ""then."" I guess several of the reviews of the Q50 have suggested that it did not improve upon the G37 -- which may be what you were referring to. We may all have our definitions of ellps or even luxury for that matter, which is why I say, most of the time, ""Drive it like you live. . . ."""
4045,"June  5, 2014  9:16PM",laurasdada," We appear to be a verbose, well-educated, fair and friendly bunch. I enjoy this topic, and topics in a similar vein. Watches and cars are a bit related, as several car mfgs and watch mfgs have affiliations, e.g. Breitling/Bentley, Porsche Design, Ferrari/Girard Perregaux. Heuer and racing. Heck, Autoweek regularly writes articles about watches for drivers and regarding auto affiliations. Just my humble opinion, but these forums should be fun and informative. Marktheredsbengal's posts generally are just that. I like cars and watches, epecially my IWC, Omega, Tag Heuer and Seiko. Even my ShopNBC sourced Invictas! And, yes, I would love a Rolex Cosmograph Daytona, if anyone would like to give me one... Drive it like you enjoy life!"
4046,"June  5, 2014 10:08PM",cdnpinhead," Indeed. If one enjoys life, much of what goes on here is perfectly acceptable, especially Mark's verbose missives (which he's been posting for far longer than those who keep this particular board's numbers up). I've been reading his posts for well over a decade and generally find them enjoyable and/or useful. Skip the stuff you don't like. Read the stuff you do. Make comments that don't piss people off."
4047,"June  5, 2014 11:48PM",sweendogy,"Marks comments stand on own, you can love them or question them- I generally love his posts and they usually add something. He's long at times and trys hard to explain things in verbose commentary which is his style. The ego driven explanation on LUx is nothing but rude, well educated in writting sure but let's be real- no one needs to know about the 4 1k pens one ones .maybe he was ""stroking"" his ego.- I understand people here are drawn to badges, I'm a city person who grew up in a modest environment and we are on an ELlps forum- this is not a BEntley forum- the category started with value oriented lux performance cars, entry level. From post One on this board I have always stressed the dollar as being a major factor when comparing cars, research and overall drive as well. That's why I don't understand the puppet mentality of some who just follow the badge."
4048,"June  6, 2014 12:17AM",markcincinnati,"I would suggest, perhaps even argue, the dollar becomes progressively less of a major factor when we move into any incarnation of the Premium or Luxury class (especially where cars are concerned). Folks -- generally speaking -- don't shop for ellps or lps cars with much consideration for budget (however, even when buying an ellps, I assume we all stipulate $X dollars for the purchase -- of our new 3 series or new IS 350, etc). I would hope we all want to get the most we can for our dollar, and I assume we do. If, however, you want to spend less, it is quite possible to move down a rung and get, for instance, a Chrysler 300 -- and there is NOTHING wrong with that. The reason the Escalade (for example) exists is because there are folks who are very happy to pay for the Caddy over the lesser GM offerings that lack the Wreath and Crest. Of course there are substantive differences (between the Cadillac and the GMC for instance), but if you read the profits story you know the margins ARE much higher the more you climb the lux/premium/ellps/lps ladder. Perhaps the luxury goods represent a lesser ""value"" since they have higher profit margins -- but I'll wager if fill in the blank produces yet another vehicle with breathtakingly expensive MSRP's there will probably be no shortage of takers. Who would have thought an X6 would have a market -- well, not me. And, much as I love Audis, I test drove -- back to back -- an A6 and an A7 and until I opened the glove box and found the stack of bills, I kept hunting for the $10,000 premium the A7 commanded. They can't keep the A7's in stock. If you had any concern about price for content, there would be far fewer A7 sales ""if you axe me!"" I have a few ""expensive"" pens (gifts from my wife, to repeat), I ""appreciate"" them, but would not buy them for myself. Like laurasdada, I see the ""value"" of the Omega or the IWC or the Tag, I also appreciate the Invicta and the Swiss Army -- in sum this particular forum is less about ""budget"" or ""value"" or ""MSRP"" than it is about folks who ""aspire"" to ""the next step up the ladder."" Of course, I am often wrong, but seldom uncertain. To anyone who interprets anything I say as being rude either in intention or execution, I apologize. Like I said, you guys (not gender defining) are brutal."
4049,"June  6, 2014 12:41AM",flightnurse,"Mark's writing reminds me of a friend, when he told a story he took the long way to get to the point, which I kind of like."
4050,"June  1, 2014  6:20PM",m6user,"If this was a forum about ELPS one would expect no power seats, no leather, no sunroolf, no high tech in the dash, etc. But most buyers, when they are looking for a luxury car, expect those kinds of things. Hard core rally guys could probably care less as all they really care about is does it run and is it fun to drive. But when one positions the discussion to talk about entry level LUXURY PERFORMANCE sedans then at least a moderate level of luxury should be expected or we might as well include Mazda6s and Honda Accord V6 in the discussion. Luxury cars are not strictly delineated by the car but by the dealer, warranty, service etc that also comes with the purchase of luxury nameplate. The reason why many on here were opposed to the TSX being included here was that it didn't seem to have the performance side nailed down. However, it did have the luxury side nailed down pretty well as most of the things recently mentioned came standard on it. I think when you buy(and pay extra for) a luxury car from a luxury nameplate there should be somewhat of a basic standard which one can expect without having to option the vehicle up to the hilt just to reach the standard that most other luxury brands start off with. Some here almost come across as denigrating those that do like a little luxury with their auto by making statements like ""if it doesn't come with it I don't need it or if I don't need it to shift gears, what good is it"". Not direct quotes but silly just the same."

This, of course, isn't the place for this discussion, but since it came up, I wanted to give fair warning."
4075,"June  2, 2014 10:02PM",flightnurse, I posted two links to the manufacture web page so read all about it.
4076,"June  2, 2014 10:05PM",flightnurse," Again I think BMW knows what some people will do, they know about JB4, just because the ECU captures the over boost, it would be impossible for them wiggle out of warranty work unless they have hard evidence that something was added. How do you like the JB4 on the 135?"
4077,"June  2, 2014 10:58PM",kyfdx,"it would be impossible for them wiggle out of warranty work unless they have hard evidence that something was added. They don't have to wiggle out of it... ""We show four examples of overboost, and now you have an internal engine failure and we deny your warranty claim"". Unless your brother is a lawyer and works for free, you'll be out of luck. Don't get me wrong.. I wouldn't presume to suggest this is likely to happen. Just that your warranty won't be any good, if they can tie anything to your modifications. And, they don't have to ""prove it"". They can just refuse to fix it."
4078,"June  2, 2014 11:06PM",Mr_Shiftright,"It's probably fine but as you all know, a turbo or supercharger will immediately exploit any unusual weakness inherent in the engine. You have maybe a higher mileage engine with a little weepiness in the head gasket? BOOM! That's gonna blow out of there. Carbonized engine? Bad tank of gas in your neighborhood? Not a good thing with over-boosted turbo. The reason that BMW sets the boost level where it does is, of course, so that the car maintains that nice balance of reliability, nice manners and decent performance. They compromise, in other words, on the side of longer life, stable idle, good mpg, etc. They are looking at the consequences from hundreds of thousands of cars, not just one. I don't practice what I preach. My MINI is jacked, too."
4079,"June  2, 2014 11:49PM",sweendogy,In looking at this I'm all for the 320- but would do a lot of research b4 strapping a performance mod even to a cheap lux sedan - 35k not a lot to spend on a car these days but I don't know if I could deal with the embarrassment of a blown engine and going to the dealership for replacement.
4080,"May 30, 2014  3:25PM",dino001,"4-series Gran Coupe (low ride, 4 doors, rear hatch, stylishly sloped back) is already on BMW's website. Pricing is basically same as the normal coupe. They're probably underpricing it (in relative terms, of course as we all know BMW are too expensive in general, but that's a different discussion) vs. the established segments (there is more metal in GC than coupe). I like that, 435i GC is now on top of my list. Not quite ""entry level"", but not full luxury, either. After I add ""stuff"", the list price will be mid-to-high 50s. A lot, I know. I'll wait of course, never buy a new thing, let the market to sort it out. One thing missing is the manual tranny, but I already made peace with myself getting an automatic as my next car."

I have sent pm's to couple of client advisors on bimmerfest, but they are on west coast and gave me emails of salespeople of the east coast, I emailed them but haven't heard back. At what NET cap cost a lease of around 300 is possible with minimal down + 7msd's. I am open to leasing a demo or service loaner on a 320i xdrive or 328i xdrive. Any help is appreciated."

He should be able to help. In regards to lease of 320i, go to cars.com and build yourself a 320i they will give you invoice of the car and can send this build to 3 dealers. A local guy on Bimmerfest was able to lease a 2014 320i (on dealer lot) base 320i with 6 spd mannel and Sport Package, out of pocket if I remember was $3700 includes 7 MDS and fee's he had everything else rolled into the lease.

4083,"May 30, 2014  6:39PM",flightnurse," The issue is that 99% of the posters here have never driven a 320i, they just see HP figures and make comments. In base form without my upgrade I never had a problem in everyday driving, 200lbs of torque comes on at 1250 (500 more then idle) and the 8 spd transmission really makes the car feel faster. With my performance mod I have done, my 320i is faster then any stock E90 328i. The price I paid for my 320i with Mod is a bargain. All the ""luxury items I hear the 320i lacks, if i didn't get in the car, then I didn't need it. Premium package and leather is want I wanted, it gave me the sunroof, power seats (front) folding side mirrors, and all power down windows and comfort access.. The dealer could have gotten me a 320i sport with the Premium package, but I would have had to wait 5 days... I needed a car now. So I'm happy... This car goes to my younger niece next year, and since the new 4 series GC was just released, has caught my eye."
4084,"May 30, 2014  6:47PM",sweendogy,"Wow this discussion has just heated up-- love it. The tsx comment correct it should not be here- from May @flightnurse said: Graphic, when it comes to cars brand means a lot. Look at Hyundai, Rick's Genesis is a perfect example. It has the same content as a E class and 5 Series and the price is that of a mid level 3 series. The ride is on par with a Lexus GS, but it does not have the star on the hood or the roundel. So people could get a Accord over a CLA but wont. Now we understand why people would pay 35k for basically a badge - thanks @flightnurse‌ and yes I was against buying an auto - but in reading reviews on the s4 I learned the car was faster and more efficient in auto form- and since I was buying used & I wanted one with audi select with rear sports dif, nav and upgraded b&o radio. Finding a car as equipped is like trying to find a 320 with no sunroof and a manual - impossible certainly up east."
4085,"May 30, 2014  6:48PM",flightnurse," Yes the 4 series GC is a looker, and you are right they are under pricing it, and the one you prices is it 435? With the stage one mod on a 428i it's just as quick as a stock 335. The one I priced at was $50K, minus 8% for ED, plus BMWCC, USAA, and Grad money, one i built could be had for 42K and change."
4086,"May 30, 2014  7:07PM",nyccarguy,"@flightnurse‌ I know you are happy with your 320i. I believe you said you have even chipped it to make it faster for a not so unreasonable amount of money. I'm not knocking the 320i. I had one as a loaner once. For my daily driving needs it would suit me just fine. Around town I found it comfortable and docile. It rode smooth on the highway. I'm quite sure the current body style chassis is stronger and the 320i handles better than my 2011 328xi. I did find myself having to plan a little bit for passing maneuvers. I don't like the MASSIVE headrests or the giant screen stuck on top of the dashboard. I even think the 320i is a much better looking vehicle than the X1. I was simply stating that dollar for dollar, you get better acceleration on an X1 28i vs. a 320i and an X1 35i vs. a 328i. I know that BMWs even in their ""base"" form are better driving cars than their competitors. Our 1st BMW was my wife's 2007 X3 that had 3 options: Heated Seats, Rear Privacy Glass, & Metallic Paint. We loved it. The fact that BMW offers a 320i with a dedicated RWD platform sets them apart from the competition. I think it is amazing that a dealer stocks a 320i with a 6 speed stick & sport pkg. Around here, the cars all have X Drive and an automatic (I know why, I took my Prelude yesterday forgetting that it was a ""get away day""). A Sports Package around here with our Texas sized pot holes and crumbling roads is a no-no. There are faster cars in the price range (Sonata Turbo, V6 Accord) for even less money. There are cars that offer more luxury features & gadgets for less money too. Just because they are faster, more powerful, and offer more gadgets doesn't make them better cars at all."
4087,"May 30, 2014  7:14PM",dino001,"Yes, it was 435 Sports Line, Premium, Technology and Driver Assistance Packs - that goes into second half of fifties. One may keep adding stuff, HK sound, nicer wheels, whatever. I was just looking at list, to get an idea. Not sure how much I'd really have to pay, as I don't get USAA or grad money. BTW, I believe ED is 7%, might go for it, but maybe not. Done it once already. I don't believe you'd be able to stack all of those discounts with ED - may be wrong. Did somebody make you such offer, or you just imagined that number? I'd like to meet people ho can really get 50K list brand new BMW model for 42 grand. I don't think there are many."

4089,"May 30, 2014  8:56PM",tlong,"Honestly sometimes the snobbery stereotypes of BMW drivers are apparent even in this forum. Really, your car doesn't measure testosterone levels. I'm not particularly a huge fan of BMW, but I can admire their vehicles and what they've done in the marketplace. To me, being ""sporty"" is NOT about horsepower or torque. Sure, that's nice, but if that were what was important I'd buy a Vette or a Camaro. Straight-line acceleration is not what makes an ELLPS appealing to me. I admire and appreciate, shall we say, ""precision"". I like precise, tight steering. I like a reasonably comfortable, yet firm and precise ride. I like going around corners, not at 0.8g, but in a way that the steering feel is precise, I know exactly where the car is going to go, and I can feel the feedback through the steering wheel. I don't even particularly care to autocross my vehicles or pull high g's in corners. So I also like a ""nice"" interior. I can get fairly lower-horsepower, ""precise"" vehicles at reasonable cost (the Mazda 3 comes to mind). But those vehicles usually don't have the ""nicer"" interiors that I like. It was all of these thoughts and characteristics that caused me to buy an A4 in the late '90's. And now I drive an '05 TL, and you know what - although the interior is ""nice"" and the horsepower is quite good, the driving dynamics are still a bit too floaty/boaty and lacking. So I DON'T begrudge somebody liking a 320i. It's not all about testosterone, or horsepower, at least to some of us. And it's not about snobbery, either. We all have different needs and tastes. Insulting each others' rides - well, pretty childish IMHO."
4090,"May 30, 2014  9:42PM",stickguy,"Tlong, you sound like me. I think a good word to use is Balance, along with control (you mentioned precision)."
4091,"May 30, 2014 10:23PM",justg0," I couldn't agree more. I just traded in my BMW 335d (M-sport package) and got a BMW 320i (Sport package) and I am loving it. I was looking at other similar cars in the price range - Audi A3 2.0, VW GTI, Honda Accord, but none of these came close to fun that I had when I test drove the 320i with Sport package. I would have been able to get more standard options with all other models, but none of them came close to the handling and nimbleness that was there in the BMW (my opinion). I also looked at 328i (Sport line and no line). The 328i Sport line was definitely faster compared to 320i, but only if you went at it hard. In normal to mid range driving (which is what I normally do), I found really no difference. 328i without sport package felt too soft. I am actually having more fun driving the 320i than I had in my 335d, which had much higher HP and gobs of torque."
4092,"May 31, 2014  1:00AM",dino001,"I just attended BMW's drive event with 4-series, C350 coupe, S5 and Lexus IS. I drove 435 with Msport line, Benz and Audi. All three are very nice. S5 felt sportiest of them, the DSG shifts made sounds like computer game. Its supercharged engine had phenomenal note. Benz was plush, well balanced, still quite quick. BMW had everything in great balance, the sports suspension was what I like. The exhaust note more throaty than I remember on 335 I drove during the performance delivery in Spartanburg. They also had 428 Gran Coupe on display. It's gorgeous. Back seat headroom is too small for 6 feet tall person, but the extra utility of hatch is great. Love the looks. Couldn't drive it, as that one was preproduction European model, even had manual transmission, not available for US market. It's definitely on my list, but I'm not rushing in to put a deposit down. BTW, I had a great conversation with the product rep about some features. They reportedly changed the start/stop feature defaulting to last setting, as opposed to previous always going back to active. It is reportedly US market only, in Europe they kept the old one due to carbon emission garbage. The shaking on restart is reduced and also depends on which cylinder restarts first."
4093,"May 31, 2014  4:00AM",sweendogy,@dino001‌ thanks for sharing that seems like a cool event. Just looked online @ 435 (grand) and the hatch body def improves overall looks. Looks like the bigger engine will not be avail at launch(?) with xdrive.

4096,"May 31, 2014  5:24AM",plekto,"OK, let's get serious for a minute. 4 doors and leather and nav and doesn't suck at handling? I put every option that I could find on a Focus ST, plus the special paint, moonroof, and so on and got a Truecar price of $27K. 4 doors. Handles better, looks better, is faster. Almost 335i fast, in fact. Those full leather Recaro seats are also very comfortable, despite their color scheme. So if you want more performance, you have a better option for less money. Or you can go the other way and want more luxury and better performance for the same money. Auto magazines compare the 335i and the G37 routinely. I think the poor 320i will end up roadkill vs even the base model G37. It's not that BMW doesn't make good cars, it's that they did the same thing that Lexus did with the miserable IS250. It's so weak, bland, and uninspiring to drive compared to the bigger version that it really doesn't deserve to be in any category other than ""next""."
4097,"May 31, 2014  3:08PM",sweendogy,"@plekto - forget about it- as flight explained in his genesis comments from May, its about brand has nothing to do with what you actually get.

4098,"May 31, 2014  8:23PM",justg0,"@plekto‌ - Focus ST or G37 or GTI all are very nice cars in terms of handling and performance. I think it comes down to personal preference in what you like. So who would pay BMW premium to get a 320i with lower horsepower? I am quoting from an article that I read online (http://www.bimmer-mag.com/issues/120/articles/practical-considerations?page=4#.U4odyagWeG0): Beyond that entry-level buyer, here’s who should also consider the 320i: urban commuters seeking BMW handling, luxury, connectivity and panache, and those upon whom the harsh realization has dawned that they don’t need a rocket car to satisfy their daily driving needs. From stoplight-to-stoplight, it would be rather nice to use less gas, and it’s equally nice to spend less money. The 36-month lease payment is $50 less for the 320i than that for the 328i, and even though the latter is much quicker and potentially faster, you won’t miss that sitting in traffic. The two cars are virtually indistinguishable at light throttle under 40 mph. Why pay more? That's me going from a BMW 335d to 320i. I save $200 per month on my lease and I am actually having more fun with the 320i. Maybe because its lighter, not sure, but it feels just more lively and the handling is so much more precise. I could have gone with Focus ST or G37 and saved some more money (for some reason the GTI and A3 lease much higher due to really bad residuals), but decided to stay with BMW, since having had it before, I knew exactly what I was getting - a RWD sedan that handles great and is lot of fun to drive in around the city."
4099,"June  1, 2014  1:02AM",sweendogy,"Don't mind the above response understandable wanting to save money, and get a rwd sedan & if you can due it with weather, but is this car a ELLPs under that configuration, no it's not - Lexus once sold a RWD is250 that could be had with a 6 speed - they sold it as a performance sedan- no one bought this configuration or cared- even caddy which is aiming big time at the bmw has a similar priced car and a base engine with similar weak power but neglected to give us the manual because it's not a real draw with the weaker engine-non-turbo, it's more of a pricing thing I guess. Real performance seekers would never opt for the 4 cyl 180 non turbo- it's bland. Also real lux seekers would never opt for a pleather, base stereo, no power seat car - doesn't add up- car is not Ellps. And at the bargain price of 35k really? And done"
4100,"June  1, 2014  2:01AM",dino001,"Have you even driven it, Sweeny? How do you know it's so bad and weak? I have not driven it myself, perhaps my next service visit I get a chance, if dealer finally turns that 328 loaner inventory. I must say, I rather believe a guy who actually drove it and wrote that article that said this 320 reminded him the old 325 he actually owned (which has been basically a benchmark defining the category in its balanced design), rather than a guy who looks at some number tables and proclaims the thing not being worthy his time. BTW, isn't it interesting that today's car having track time of 1988 M3 (just 26 years) can be seen as having a ""weak engine""? Sure, things evolved and expectations today are somewhat different then 20+ years ago, but perhaps we went a bit too far. It is true that the competition honestly caught up with BMW in lot of aspects of that category, a lot of that started in arms race in brochure values of the horsepower, or straight line accelaration numbers combined with adding nice stuff to it. It is a new reality. Over 200 horses, 3000 lbs, we still complain too little of thise or that. Consumer is the king. BMW themselves also evolved in direction that many think lost some original appeal. But I simply cannot take your argument that just because some numbers don't align with your idea what ELLPS should be, it doesn't belong. Until I actually sit inside and try it, I don't know."

Merging down an on ramp at 40 it shot up to 70 quite quickly (and smoothly!). Maybe the manual tranny helped, but I doubt I would have ever thought it was underpowered."

The type of driver who is all of that will be buying the car with automatic virtually 100% of the time.(barring some oddball statistical freak who you find to come here on this forum just to dispute this) So no manual. But, wait... everyone says that to be ELLPS it has to have manual... So are we talking ""offered with manual so that I can say it qualifies, despite that nobody buys this model with manual"" or ""It's not the real thing unless it has manual - let me show you the pictures""? So... no manual, no power, no luxury, and 30K? Tell me how this qualifies. All I get out of this equation is ELS... Entry level sedan.

On the other hand, I have a hot hatch that puts over 300 bhp through the front wheels. It is also fun, but in an entirely different way. Of course many of the ""experts"" in this topic would dismiss all three cars because-oh the horror!-none of them have full leather power seats.

4108,"June  1, 2014  4:14PM",Mr_Shiftright,"Well then, the argument for the 320 has to be that a 328 is not worth an extra $50 a month. That seems a bit weak, no?"
4109,"June  1, 2014  6:09PM",justg0," I think its worth it for people looking for that extra hp. Its the same argument when going from 328 to 335. Is that extra hp worth the premium you pay? Only the person buying can decide that for themselves. Another thing is that in reality the difference comes out to be more like $100 or more. The moment a dealer gets a car with Sport line or M Sport, they put some much other stuff that the car gets lot more expensive. I was hard pressed to find a 328i with just Sport line and nothing much more. So unless you are willing to custom order and wait, you would end up paying much more. @plekto said: So no manual. But, wait... everyone says that to be ELLPS it has to have manual... I can bet 90% of people who buy the cars in the ELLPS category, whether BMW, Audi, Lexus, Mercedes, etc. get automatic (and also probably have never seen this forum). I haven't looked at any data on this, so if someone has anything to support or refute this, would appreciate that. I am just going on based on what I found on dealer lots when I was looking. So, in that case none of these cars would qualify to be a ELLPS, we might as well close this forum down And yes, I did get an automatic, but that's my personal preference. BMW does make it available in manual like their other 3 series."

Not even a folding rear seat. I see that nothing has changed. Once you content it up, add $5K or $10K easily. If you want more sport than luxury, BMW is good. If you want some luxury, too, there are better values out there."

Still doesn't mean it is a good substitute for someone wanting a RWD sporty sedan, though. It's really so simple. Different shoppers have different orders of preference. Some folks put tech on top, some fuel mileage, some RWD/FWD/AWD."

4120,"May 25, 2014  3:46PM",Mr_Shiftright,"The very term ""luxury performance"" is tricky--in one way of looking at it, they are at odds with each other, in another way, why can't you have both in equal measure? For some, having a howling engine and gobs of feedback through your ears, hands and butt are anathema to ""luxury"", to others, any car lacking such things cannot be regarded as a ""performance"" car. I hate to bring up ancient history but in this case it might be relevant. When Mercedes first starting getting serious about capturing the luxury car market in America (by serious, I mean, large sedans, leather, wood trim, AC, automatic, plenty of gadgetry, plenty of power)--this would be in the very late 1960s, early 1970s---they ran into some serious marketing problems with former Lincoln and Cadillac owners. What was that? It was a lot of complaints about ""these cars ride too hard"" and/or ""the shifting i too firm"" and ""the seats are too stiff"". What the American drivers were experiencing was ""performance"" --excellent brakes, precise handling and a rational cockpit designed to help you drive fast."
4121,"May 25, 2014  4:03PM",roadburner,"I have an E28 brochure from the early '80s that contains the phrase ""That unfamiliar sensation you are feeling is called the road."""
4122,"May 28, 2014  8:31PM",markcincinnati,"Been so busy for weeks! Promised myself I would at least make a post when the '14 S4 reached 10,000 miles. Well, I'm about 400 miles away from 11,000 and I need to report to the collective that once again Audi has managed to build an engine that starts out strong, reboots itself somehow around 5,000 miles into a stronger (and more economical) version of itself, then settles in for another 5,000 miles before it again reboots itself into a noticeably more potent version. My wife's SQ5 also has passed 10,000 miles and I am now fully able to discern the differences between her 8-speed tiptronic transmission and my 7-speed s-tronic. In a nutshell: the 8-speed seems, to me at least, to offer the most balanced (of the attributes comfort and sport) presentation of goodness in ""D"" -- the thing is virtually always in its sweet spot in terms of torque on tap, although the downshift rev-matching seems to be, hmm, ""muted"" or somehow pushed out of the foreground. Conversely, the S4 in ""D"" seems hell-bent to hide the performance of the supercharged engine behind a penchant to always shift up a second or a second and half too soon. Also, the s-tronic, in ""D"" really doesn't seem to want you to notice when it downshifts as you are slowing down. In ""S"" mode, the S4 can bear its teeth providing gobs of torque, a willingness to pull in second gear as if it were on a mission to pull a 100 year old tree stump out of hard dirt. Also, in ""S"" mode the S4 under even somewhat mild acceleration makes that delightful ""burp or fart"" sound upon up-shift, time after time. The s-tronic is a miracle of modern medicine in fact. When I got into the SQ5 the other day, I felt the transmission attempt to provide velvety shifts (which it did virtually all of the time, except when I pressed it hard, not to). The slight differences in feel between the two transmissions are that the s-tronic can also provide velvety shifts, but they are just ""this much"" smoother somehow -- shifts that under light or moderate acceleration are more heard than felt. The differences are subtle when you're pressing lightly on the right pedal, but even the masterful Audi transmission programmers cannot completely make the tiptronic mimic the s-tronic's slick moves. The sport seats in both Audi ""S"" models continue to impress with no break-in or break-down of any kind perceptible -- and, the interiors still look fresh despite the recent time I spent sitting behind the wheel of a Premium+ A3 (didn't get to drive it, however.) The technology too is impressive, even though the choice of T-mobile as the in-car WiFi carrier (3G with very poor signal quality about 1/3rd of the time and 2G with even worse quality the rest of the time) impresses like a turd in a swimming pool. I have repeatedly asked Audi for an upgrade to another carrier (AT&T, Verizon, cup and a string), I have to assume there is something that (for some fee) could be done to unlock the technology to get off of what has to be the worst cellular carrier ever (at least in SW Ohio). Of course when you get behind the wheel of a new A3 you notice NO T-MOBILE this time around. You can bet by 2016 all Audis will be divorced from T-Mobile. I'd keep my subscription if they'd price it in synch with its usefulness, perhaps $7.50 per month (in SW Ohio anyway). Instead they want $30 per month on a month-to-month basis. That fellow ELLPS lovers is the only flaw in other-wise delightful pair of ""S"" Audi cars. BTW - went to the Porsche dealer: finally they had ONE Macan S in stock -- hideous color combo, black on black on black (wheels), gawwd I thought goth was dead (I crack myself up). However, we do want to drive the Macan to see how the SQ5 holds up against it pound for pound and dollar for dollar. As always, drive it like you live."
4123,"May 28, 2014  8:36PM",kyfdx,"Isn't the Macan a virtual twin of the SQ5? Same powertrain and platform, right?"
4124,"May 28, 2014  9:03PM",markcincinnati,"Nope. Porsche engine, transmission -- lower HP and torque than SQ5 but offers the ability to option to over $90K with a super high output turbo V6 not offered by Audi. SQ5 lifted ground clearance; Porsche ground clearance in ""hunker mode."" 33% of the Q5 lives on in the Macan. Offers from Porsche a seemingly price competitive version of the SQ5, if you play with the configurations possible, however, the Macan does cost more. The presumably typically optioned Macan S at the Porsche dealership (which owns the Audi dealership too) was about $64K. My wife's Prestige SQ5 was $63.5K or something close to that. An argument could be made that the Prestige SQ5 with several upgrades is still less ($5K) than a comparably equipped Macan S. I would think, however, if you're looking at the two at sub $65K, the Macan may present itself as, well, a Porsche! And, even if the Audi is the ""deal"" it is still NOT A PORSCHE. I would want to drive both and I would want to be fair with the option set up. I am an Audi fan, to be sure, but the Macan could cannibalize the SQ5 -- not the mainline Q5's, the SQ5. Either Audi needs to up the ante (an RSQ5 perhaps) or be relegated to a rung lower in the giant pecking order in the automotive sky. Funny, Audi has registered the name RSQ3, but as far as I can find out, NOT the RSQ5 -- can you say ""Marketing!"""
4125,"May 28, 2014 10:41PM",sweendogy,@markcincinnati‌ - great write ups on your experience with both audis. Now I have to ask the question you have 60k and need one car - which one of the audis do you pick? I wish they still had the s4 wagon-

4127,"May 29, 2014  5:32AM",plekto," Oddly enough, if you're comparing a base model 320 to other options, the various ""Muscle Cars"" can be had with more options. They handle just as well and offer RWD and a manual transmission if you want it. And for as much as $5K less. And we're not even getting into VW, Infiniti, and others, which also usually come with large year end incentives. I know this forum is about Luxury Performance cars, but the fact is that the 320 simply is so dreadful in its base form that it's not even as nice as a Civic EX. Now, with the bigger engine and more options, it's a great car, but anyone looking for a $30K or under car has a plethora of better choices."
4128,"May 29, 2014  1:47PM",qbrozen,"but a muscle cars you are talking about aren't sedans. Its still a really simple equation. RWD + sedan + manual. Find another new one for less. The only chance is if street prices for the ATS or G are lower at any given time. Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying its a good choice by any means. I'm just simply giving facts as I know them. You could get a Charger, but its a fat pig with auto trans. I honestly can't think of anything else. If Suby/Yota makes a sedan version of the BRZ/FRS, they'd be in a category of 1, I believe."

4130,"May 29, 2014  8:43PM",markcincinnati,"A part of the reason folks buy the LPS and ELLPS cars is ""the logo."" Yep, you can almost always find something that seems to equal and often better the ""LPS"" and/or ""ELLPS"" -- call it whatever you want (including brainwashing), but folks frequently look at a fairly large swath of the market and then end up with a ""fill in the blank"" because it is a ""fill in the blank."" I would suspect, as a somewhat related example, that the Macan S might cannibalize the SQ5's sales (especially if there are Macans on the lot for under $60K), because the Macan is a Porsche. My friend, thinking he had an a-ha moment bought a Passat CC thinking he got so much more than he would have gotten (in this case) in an A4. Now, the truth of the matter is that he may be accurate in his Consumer Reports Clinical assessment of the two vehicles. Perhaps ""hate"" is too strong of a word, but -- he hated the CC -- because it WASN'T an Audi. Same story goes for someone who did the same kind of thing with a Nissan instead of an Infiniti, they couldn't wait to early terminate the lease. Several additional data points are certainly possible for me to share with y'all -- but you probably have your own data points and stories to tell about someone who ""saw the light"" and finally got the Infiniti instead of the BMW and then, almost immediately, was pining for a BMW (which would have been seriously de-contented when compared to the Infiniti -- which cost less money too.) I sat in (didn't drive) a maxed out Avalon and sat in and drove the Lexus ""ES,"" concluding the Avalon was mo' car for less money. Now, in my case, I have little if any affection for the Lexus brand vs the Toyota ) Avalon -- so I would think of myself as opting for the Avalon seeing no advantage to the Lexus that would justify an extra charge. But, somewhere back in back of my mind, I know so many ""top class"" folks who practically worship Lexi, so were I to be faced with the choice, I imagine I would ultimately cave (and opt for the Lexus.) Funny (well sorta), I'll buy Kroger Brand every time vs the national brand if given the chance and if the Kroger Brand (pasta for instance) is cheaper. I buy Costco shirts for crissakes, but I wouldn't own a Costco gas grill -- gotta be Weber. The badges on cars and many other things (and yes we do need those stinkin' badges) are quite an important part of selecting, buying, financing and ""enjoying the ride"" [of the new 'sheen.] I have no idea why -- maybe I really have been brainwashed -- but I have no interest in a WRX at virtually any ""real life probable"" price. I'd rather have a bone stock ""fill in the blank"" ELLPS any day. DILYL"
4131,"May 29, 2014 11:37PM",sweendogy,"Fair commentary - and I do believe its brainwashing- I love the weber analogy because I'm the same with grills. The pasta right on as well.. Years back in 03 I bought a jetta gli because it gave me more car- 6spped vr6 then the acura tsx I also considered. I get the brand clout but for bmw but this car is pretty weak when you look at the stats sheet and consider price.

I can so live with two less doors and 10K less money spent for a car that drives better. (0-60 in 5.7 seconds vs 6.7?) The base model 3 series is just such a disappointment. 60 less HP just turns it into a slug that feels like you're driving an E30 with a almost thousand pounds added. Oh, wait... And they make you pay for everything including color paint. The article mentioned above didn't clarify that your choices without spending $550 extra were plain black and white. Not just non-metallic paint, but spray-can basic black or white to add insult to injury. $10K less and two fewer doors... If you need that easier back seat entry and exit that badly, you're better off just getting a SUV or a Camry. Also, of note was the test of a V8 mustang vs a M3 that was done a while back. The reviewer gave the ""win"" to the M3, but it was 0.02 seconds around a track with everything turned off in the hands of a racing driver. And a loss of 6+ seconds(!) with the normal driving assists turned on (same driver - ouch). Given the vast price difference, it was clear that the ""muscle cars"" of today don't handle anything like their namesakes. Sporty and performance? I'd take one of those ""muscle"" cars, add leather and all the goodies, and live with two less doors. And still be less money than a 320i with nothing on it."

I agree with the comment that the X1 > 320i. But, yeah, I guess it doesn't precisely fit the sedan category. EDIT: I just checked on X1 pricing ... you can't get a 28i sdrive with a manual trans?? Ugh. And its not just a matter of living with 2 fewer doors. Even if I cut 2 more holes in my Mustang, it would not make the back seat much more inhabitable. I can live with it because my need of the back seat mostly amounts to taking my 4-yr-old 3 miles to the daycare. But I find myself driving one of my other vehicles on those 2 days a week when I pick up both kids in the evening. Given the vast price difference, it was clear that the ""muscle cars"" of today don't handle anything like their namesakes. I'm not following this comment.

They are talking about a model of car, not specifically your actual car, and certainly not your child or partner. Chill brother. You have to admit that the 320 hardly could be called a performance car when many run of the mill midsize sedans have more room, power and bells and whistles than the basic 320. A lot of naturally aspirated I4s have more HP than the 320 and when optioned out are many thousands less than a similarly equipped 320. The two things that the 320 has going for it are the luxury nameplate and experience and possibly handling. I say possibly handling because the Mazda6 handles pretty darn well and has more HP than the 320. So, really, one can say the 320 is an entry level luxury sedan but is lacking on the performance side. Heck, people on here used to complain that the TSX with a measly NA I4 with 200hp and shouldn't be included because it wasn't performance enough."

This isn't the lease that is all over the net, but someone who understand leases can get this 320i for roughly $250/m on a lease with very little out of pocket usually tax and fee's."
4167,"May 23, 2014 12:28PM",qbrozen,"I agree $35k is alot of money... but, and maybe I'm forgetting something here, I believe the 320 is the cheapest RWD sport sedan on the market, regardless of luxury status."

And motor trends take -...(and to be fair they did talk it up a bit going into this ending blurb)- ""A $35,000 3 Series sedan sounds like a bargain until you learn what's not included. Extra-cost options on a sport package-equipped $34,775 320i include a rear-view camera, navigation system, real leather, enhanced Bluetooth, HID headlights, a moonroof, hands-free keyless entry, and an auto-dimming rearview mirror. Though the sport seats have two-way adjustable side bolsters, fully power-operated front seats are extra. Heated seats cost more, too, unless you consider how hot the black leatherette gets after the car sits in the sun for a few hours. Then there's the aforementioned $550 for a selection of metallic colors. We don't expect any luxury automaker to include all of the above options as standard equipment, but new-to-BMW customers intrigued by the 320i model but familiar with more value-oriented luxury brands may be taken aback by the fact that none of the above is standard.""

I know the last road trip I took from Cincinnati to Chicago (with a little in town driving-10%) I netted 28 MPG (manual calculations). Buzzing around town, I get about 21-22 MPG. I've seen a couple of CLAs around here. They're lookers. Sat in one at the local auto show. Not bad, but I wonder if an Accord doesn't have a nicer interior? A3....a looker also. S3, probably more my speed (literally). Still trying to get over my S4 experience, though. Still anxious to see the new TLX in the flesh. And, NYC, I do agree. The ELLPS that are hitting the streets (CLA, A3, 320i, etc) are, generally speaking, an exciting bunch, given their price points."

I halfway have my fingers crossed the whole place will burn down so my diminished value claim will be eliminated and I can just get a new S4 The 1,000 deductible will likely be less than my depreciation and diminished value losses, even after getting a check for diminished value, which could take a while with the speed of Mercury's decision makers."

I'd be hard pressed to pick a CLA over a loaded Accord for less money.....especially given on just about every metric you use, the Accord seems to be the better car. As you note, however, perception is reality many times. The Genesis is a perfect example of that. I've yet to hear anyone state they went from the Mercedes or BMW dealership over to the Hyundai store to cross shop the 5/E/Genesis. On top of that, the new Genesis is quite the looker in its own right. BTW...was on the interstate last night. Got the TL up to 80 MPH. It was turning right around 2,100 RPM. While driving last night, I was thinking having had the twin scroll turbo in the BMW and the S/C in the Audi, while not as fast, the 3.7L in the TL spurs on quite well, and sounds expensive to boot.

Now has he turned any of them to sell their cars for a Genesis, I doubt it. The people who can afford these cars have been buying them for years. Mark is a perfect example, he is an Audi guy, I doubt he ever looked at a Genesis before buying his S4. This doesn't mean those who have bought a Genesis didn't have a MB or BMW in the past.

Also, the 6-speed auto seems like an antique, but it appears your real world mileage has bested the EPA estimates???? The main two problems I had with the TL were: 1) The exterior looks and style (or lack thereof) 2) The interior button layout and too many little buttons. If they listen to my recipe, they'll have a real winner: Boost HP and Torque 10-15% Drop 300 lbs. Fix the styling. Better button quantity and layout.

4198,"May 18, 2014 12:34AM",flightnurse," The 320i is an entry level into a premium brand, just like the A3 is, however, the real difference is, the 320i isn't a smaller car like the A3 or CLA. It's the same F30 as the 328i which means you get a real back seat for two adults, something that the Audi and MB can not claim. This is what is setting BMW apart from Audi and BMW. When it comes to leasing, the unknown will take the 3K down and $269/m deal, since if they went to a toyota dealer that is what they would have leased a Camry LE for."

4200,"April 26, 2014  4:57AM",andres3," They are saying I should pay a 20% betterment charge for getting two new tires replacing two tires that had 80% life left. My argument is simply that since I want to change all 4 tires at the same time on the same rotation, the extra 2/32nd's on the front tires will provide me no betterment. I'm not going to delay changing the 2 newer tires when the older 2 are due for replacement just so I can eek out a ""betterment."" I will gain no benefit. If your always changing out your tires 2 at a time you are changing them out twice as frequently (in terms of shop visits and down time) than if you just change out all 4 at once. I can assume and project all 4 tires will wear evenly since the car is AWD and all 4 tires measured at the same 20% wear."
4201,"April 26, 2014  5:21AM",andres3,"Bigger problems than tires..... Got the car back yesterday afternoon. In a quick 15 minutes close eyeball inspection, I was able to find at least 10 things wrong with the car. A small scuff/scratch on the black plastic windshield cowl, multiple black marks/paint blemishes on bumper edges/corners, a small minor white scratch that if not on the prior existing damage sheet, must of been caused during the shop's 38 day ownership of the car, a tiny chip on the roof, some rough slightly bumpy paint around edges such as around the fuel filling cap area, the underside of the hood has a paint blemish, and a general impression that orange peel is more prevalent or noticeable, but not bad, just not great. I was expecting all that above and I'm sure most of that can be fixed in a 2nd trip to the body shop under warranty. However, I wasn't expecting the following: Misaligned right doors (or at least the trim isn't lining up right) Haven't measured but I'd say around 3/16"" if I had to guess). Lower Rocker panel fit and finish issues (increased gap, noticeable double sided sticky tape seeping through the wide uneven gap, paint blemishes at joint) They admitted that even with a brand new rocker panel, 9 new rivets, Audi's instructions, and new double-sided sticky tape, they've never been able to match what they do in Germany. They suggest it must be installed differently in the factory. Looks aftermarket now. The exhaust was removed and reinstalled, and now both sets of exhaust tips appear to be hanging too low in relation to the back bumper diffuser, with the right two exhaust tips noticeably about 1/2""-3/4"" lower than the left pair of exhaust tips. Number 3 bothers me the most. They say if what you can see is bad and lacks QC, then perhaps what you can't see is even worse. Oh yeah, and there's still about a 4"" piece of masking tape on the lower edge of the front right door (detailer should be fired). On the other hand, the mechanical work seems solid; that's the bright side. The car drives and runs well (of course the dealership did a large portion of that work). I'd say the only thing I can tell that might be a tad ever so slightly off is the steering wheel might just be like 1 degree off-center; very close. When I eyeball leveling the steering wheel, the car will move slightly right, then again, maybe my eyeballs are off by a degree or two."
4202,"April 26, 2014  4:13PM",graphicguy," Andres....Just my personal opinion, but I think it's time to go to the insurance company and tell them you need a new car....for all the reasons listed. If they choose to fight (like with the tires, which to me is being rather nit-picky given all 4 tires should have the same tread depth), then you can tell them to give you a new car now, or risk having a car with a salvage title instead after you begin your proceedings."
4203,"April 26, 2014  4:40PM",flightnurse," I second it and basically stated that in my posting. When a car has a repair tag of 20K which included frame (sub frame) work you are asking for issues.

4205,"April 26, 2014 11:57PM",andres3," The other driver was at fault of course. I don't cause accidents, and I'm usually able to avoid them. You have to be a really horrible terrible driver to cause a collision with me. When I told the adjuster and sent him 5 pictures of the first 5 things I noticed that were wrong (mostly paint scuffs/scratches/chips), he said Geico had paid the body shop, the body shop was my choice, and I'd have to deal with them on paint issues. Basically saying, you are on your own since you didn't choose one of our preferred shops, and our only obligation is to pay for repairs."
4206,"April 27, 2014 12:06AM",andres3," I'm liking the idea of having a new car as that's the only way I'll get back to having a German built and assembled S4 which clearly is far superior to one built and assembled in Escondido, CA. The insurance company seems to think they are off the hook and I need to sue my chosen body shop. I did point out the windshield cowl was on them since it was never on the estimate, and they said they would pay for stuff if it was missed in the original estimates or supplements. How do I get them to see it as potentially their problem again? How would I go about getting a salvage title if they don't cooperate? I am missing a few links in the chain there. I suppose my argument is that Geico and Mercury's adjuster's erred incompetently in saying this vehicle was repairable for 15.5K in 28 days. 38 days of rental for nearly $1,400, and $20.3K in repairs later, and we are where we are now. I do think I'll contact Audi and let them know this shop should certainly be DE-Certified."
4207,"April 27, 2014  5:27AM",nyccarguy,"@andres3‌ What you are going through absolutely sucks dude. You are being picky and have every right to demand nothing less than perfection from the body shop and insurance company that is fixing a ""dream car"" for you with only 4200 miles which before it got hit was still ""brand new."" Did you say they cut you a check for diminished value? It just seems at this point that you aren't going to ever be 100% happy with the car. Have them fix whatever else they can, then take the car to CARMAX, take it to a couple of Audi dealers, sell it or trade it in. Even with a ""dirty carfax,"" it is still a low mileage S4. Either way, good luck!"
4208,"April 27, 2014  2:32PM",graphicguy,"Andres...not surprising that the insurance co is being obstinate. I've made a mental note.....never buy Geico insurance. They are on the hook to make the car right, regardless of where it was repaired. You didn't sign any release papers did you?"

BTW, we have Geico and could not be happier with them, Rick had a fender bender in the Genesis, Geico really took care of him and made sure he was happy with the repairs.

The rocker panel isn't that bad, its decent work, just not Ingolstad standards. After further review, I wasn't noticing anything else I hadn't already noticed in the first 24 hours (although there was one missed/rough/abrupt shift; not repeatable or duplicatable). If they can get my list right, I think I might just be happy with the car (besides, it'll take 3 to 4 months to get one just like it; as I'd have to re-order it from Germany again). This successful outcome of course depends upon Mercury paying me decent DV, and Caliber Collision/European Autobody paying for a premium rental while they do the RE-work on my list. The car drives and rides well, so mechanically it feels strong; then again I was flopping around in a meager 4 cylinder Altima for a while and that seemed to pale in comparison to a new Accord, let alone an S4. Forgot how sturdy and tight fitting the seats were too compared to the rental fodder; reminds me to lose weight, or at least not gain any more weight. The main thing that upset me was the low hanging exhaust that isn't symmetrically low hanging. This is a bad rolling on the road advertisement for Audi, hence why I thought the shop should be uncertified."

4217,"April 30, 2014  1:21AM",markcincinnati,"My experience with insurance companies is that they will allow the ""victim"" enough latitude to take the car to a body shop that the victim believes will satisfy their needs to return the car to the status of ""like it never even happened."" Here in Cincinnati, there is ONE body shop that has gone through the Audi A8 (aluminum) certification and actually sent their techs to Germany for training and then to Chicago for follow up training. I would use this body shop for any car. Oddly, my Audi dealer does NOT have a body shop, but the dealer is part of a billion dollar dealer group that has a body shop at each of their Cadillac and Acura dealerships. If I go to the dealer with a body shop need, they used to take the car to the Audi A8 certified shop -- now, unfortunately, they trot it on over to the Cadillac dealership which does a good job. Good really is the enemy of great. I had a minor hiccup (a scratch really) and ended up ""demanding"" the car go to the certified body shop. The dealer complied but not before they offered up the Cadillac (or the Acura) body shop. I had a trim piece lose its luster on my 2009 A4, and Audi agreed to send me all new chrome trim -- since it was under warranty, I let the Cadillac body shop do the job (and they replaced the trim without incident.) There was no body work or painting involved, however. If you have any Audi product, I urge you to at least investigate ONLY taking the car to an A8 certified body shop -- they seem to have been indoctrinated with the ""doing it the right way"" and good is not good enough philosophy. Only great is great, despite the extra cost (which is NOT paid out of your pocket, typically.) I assume such a body shop would also be ""superior"" for any brand since the degree of care required for an aluminum body certified shop certainly seems to be a step or two above and beyond."

Americans assemble and build it and it gets 6 days before a tow truck is needed!

4230,"April 16, 2014  6:47PM",m6user,"Well, entry level is entry level. That definition is pretty clear cut. Sedan is pretty clear cut as well. The only thing that is questionable is the ""performance"" part. But it appears the A3 will perform just as well if not better than the A4. I think that was the hang up with the TSX being included in that it didn't really fit the ""performance"" model in a lot of people's minds. I had no problem with it being included because there are a lot of A4 w/ front wheel drive running around out west and down south that are very close on paper to a TSX. I know most people think of the Quattro when they talk Audi ELLPS but that's a choice of their own. Doesn't really matter all that much to me. But technically, a lot of the cars that have been traditionally discussed here are no the the performance entry from that particular brand anymore. It's just so complicated isn't it."

4235,"April 16, 2014  9:27PM",dash5,I like the grill now. Interesting that there is no shifter. Overall though looks great and I'm anxious to see how they price it.
4236,"April 16, 2014  9:30PM",graphicguy," Michaeall...I see that same tail light treatment in the ILX, the RLX, and how the TLX. At first, I wasn't sure I liked the LED headlights, as Acura is using them as a design cue. They're starting to grow on me, though. Looks like the tailights are the LCD ""lite pipe"" variety replacing my LED tail lights. That interior is gorgeous. Saw some other specs.... 0-60 around 5 secs for the TLX SH AWD (about 1/2 sec quicker than my current TL SH AWD). MPG is 21/31. I get 21 in the city, now. So, not sure that is an upgrade. But, if the numbers are right, I'm getting 28 MPG on the highway. If they can hit 31 MPG with the new trans, that would be great. 3.5L. 290 HP and about 270 TQ. That HP and displacement is less than my durrent TL (305 HP, 3.7L), but apparently the new 9-speed trans and weight reduction is attributed to the higher performance. TLX multi-link suspension replaces my TL's double wishbones. Not sure about that. Will have to drive to see how that affects ride/handling. Probably stop by my dealer tonight to see when their roll out is going to be."
4237,"April 16, 2014  9:44PM",flightnurse,"Having my 320i now since Oct and having over 12K miles on I can say that BMW did it's homework on a entry level Sports sedan. One can get a 320i with the Sports package, (it's really the M sport package) for $1300, a bargin... It can be had with a manual transmission out the door for roughly 5% less then MSRP, if the buyer knows how to haggle with the salesman and over on Bimmerfest, a lot of people know how to haggle. If you add the Premium package to said car, you have a nice ELLPS. Now on power, the 320i only makes 180, but installed the BMS Stage 1 ($395 and installs in 45 minutes) and the power difference between the 320 and 328 disappear. In fact, my 320i is faster then a E90 328i. Overall I'm very happy with this car, as I stated in the past, I don't plan to track the car, so not having a the sport package hasn't been a issue for me. I have been driving it lot between Phoenix and San Diego, Phoenix and Tucson, and I'm simply amazed at the highway MPG best been 36.6 MPG, with cruise set at 80 and A/C on.

Yes the TLX looks a bit better than TSX, but that's about it..."
4241,"April 17, 2014  1:26AM",stickguy,The TL I like was the 2004-2008 vintage. I was behind one today (in my 2000 TL) and enjoyed the view. Also like the interior much better (plus I fit much better).

4243,"April 17, 2014  1:20PM",dino001," Agreed. The shield/beak front felt repulsive, at least at first. It kind of grew on a little bit, but was never in a beauty contest. TSX actually looked just a tad better in this beak thing than TL. I also liked previous TSX. BTW, TSX was a perfect size for me. Similar to older BMWs and Audis. I don't really carry passengers, but I like four doors (actually five). To me back seat size is not as essential, as driving experience, which those shorter wheelbase vehicles provided. Unfortunately, all those names grew to sizes reminding their bigger brothers 10 years ago. I think the whole category really shifted. When you get something like optioned-out 335, A4 or soon coming C-class, they aren't really entry level, they are still ""sporty"", but not really ""sports"". Same would be with CTS, TLX, or others. Unfortunately, their smaller siblings, which some would now argue as ELLPS, come mostly in FWD setups, which is off for traditionalists. It becomes fact of life. It is true that contemporary FWD is not your mother's FWD - current advances in torque handling made those cars much better to drive. Many have or will have AWD option and better engines, which mitigates some of the issue."

4245,"April 17, 2014  4:46PM",laurasdada," I owned an '05 TL for 6.5 years/85k trouble-free, fun and efficient miles. One of Honda/Acuras best designs imo (along with original Legend Coupe). Clean, elegant, sporty. I was so disheartened by the current design, did not consider it for even a moment. The toned down beak/shield is an improvement, but still wouldn't mind seeing it go the way of the Dodos... The TLX, from appearances, welcome back, Acura! I""ve not owned nearly as many cars as I'd like (darn family responsibilities and fiscal conservatism!), but my '88 Integra and '05 TL remain two of my faves."

At this point, I don't have any experience with ""no shifter"" so I'll go with being neutral on the subject. I am assuming the interior utilizes the upper and lower screen approach -- I run hot and cold on that, too, but probably more cold: I am more in favor of one screen generally speaking, but the TLX's interior does seem to send out most, if not all, of the queues that suggest it is a Premium car interior (an upgrade from my 2012)."
4247,"April 18, 2014  2:32AM",andres3," My experiences with Audi have all been positive. Every company can have a bad apple. The real goal should be to buy a vehicle that never gives a company a chance to establish their customer service levels, as you never have to visit them. That's what happened my first 4,100 miles in the perfect 2014 S4, but a day before I'm supposed to pick it up at the body shop, I'm told the dealer is finding the left front side of the vehicle out of alignment spec, enough out of spec that they can't adjust to meet spec. The accident was on the right side; this could spell trouble. Not Audi's fault of course, the Lexus driver is at fault. I will say I escaped the ordeal without as little as a bruise; the belt did what it's supposed to do. I'm told the tow truck could have caused the suspension damage. All the fluids had to be refilled & recharged (coolant, transmission, transmission coolant, AC system). The driver's seat belt has to be replaced (one-time use with significant impacts). The air box had to be replaced. Might end up being more than 17K when all is said and done; I think they should have totaled it; we'll see."
4248,"April 18, 2014  2:51AM",Michaell, $17K in damage repairs is still only about 33% of the value of the car; not even close to the threshold used by most insurance carriers to write it off.
4249,"April 18, 2014  2:56AM",andres3," Yes, but when you add in Diminished value of around 15%, Rental Car expenses of about $1,250, and who knows how much extra could be needed before all said and done. And if the vehicle isn't quite right after all that effort; what then? Basically looking at near $30K or 60%. Still, too low to total, but my opinion is generally that cars are unfixable from significant accident damage. Maybe this body shop will change my mind; I'm hoping!"
4250,"April 18, 2014  3:03AM",Michaell," Oh, I'm not saying you don't have a case - we've had the diminished value discussion already and I think your car, if any, should qualify for it."

4252,"April 19, 2014  3:58PM",flightnurse," Basically looking at near $30K or 60%. Still, too low to total, but my opinion is generally that cars are unfixable from significant accident damage. Maybe this body shop will change my mind; I'm hoping! I have been in 5 accidents, 4 in cars (none my fault), one accident, I had to make a panic stop on I-8 west bound from La Mesa to Mission Valley, just picked up our truck from the dealership, truck was 6 months old, had 6K miles on, and a lady slammed into me at 65 mph, lucky for me, the truck was taller then her car, her insurance company was going to fix the truck, it needed a new frame, cost of said frame, $7900, then another $13K to R&R frame. My EX and I fought the insurance company to just total the truck, since the job was going to take roughly 3.5 months to complete.... So after 5 months (it took the dealership 2 months to complete the job) but each time I would take the truck out for a test drive I would find something wrong with the truck, after 5 months, of nit picking her insurance wrote a check for the truck. Andres3 be very picky and DO NOT sign a release unless you are 100% happy with the car, after a while, the adjuster might just say, lets forget this and write you a check... Doesn't your S4 have an aluminum frame?"
4253,"April 19, 2014  4:28PM",Mr_Shiftright,"The problem isn't so much that the cars can't be fixed---they certainly can be made to look as good as new---, but that the insurance companies don't want to be trapped into, or locked into, supplemental repairs on a complex luxury car, weeks or months after the initial repair. So I think they assess the damage not only as to estimated repairs, but the type of car and the type of damage. You know, floods, fires, etc, give the insurance company pause."
4254,"April 19, 2014  5:32PM",andres3," > The S4 is a combination of aluminum, ultra high strength steel, and steel components. It appears the aluminum sub-frame of the suspension got knocked out of place affecting the left side though the impact was on the right. They said they were able to adjust it the 2nd day at the dealership to meet specs. I think unlike Toyota (in general), an Audi authorized body shop doesn't try to mess around and do things ""half-way."" There's only 3 body shops that qualify for ""Audi Certified"" in all of San Diego County. A good example is that on the first day at the dealership, they didn't try to magically adjust parts out of spec to meet spec. They admitted it didn't meet spec and worked on the car longer to get it right. In a way; this is a good thing; although my rental will now be around $1,400 due to the extended delays. I think they know the typical Audi owner is meticulous with attention to detail. After all, they didn't settle for a VW. The body shop will get the car back first thing Monday morning, do a test drive by driving the vehicle back to the shop (what happens if they wreck on the way back?) After that, he said they had a good 1.5 days of work finishing up the buffing, polishing, and detailing on the panels that were repainted (a majority of panels by the way due to blending). I hope I don't face delays like you did, because the more that is eaten up by rental costs out of the guy's $10K insurance limit, the harder it will be for me to collect decent diminished value. When I told Geico to put what they told me over the phone in writing (that they'd defer to me to be made whole first from the 10K, then come in afterwards), they balked. They said let's wait and see what Mercury agrees to pay for DV and other things first, then we'll talk. I sent a demand letter to Mercury for 15% of the total purchase price $55K (including fees/taxes) = $8,250 for DV alone. I added a caveat that this was to settle fast and quickly without me having to pay professional appraisers and incur additional costs. I told them if they force me to go further, I will no longer negotiate the highest of my consultants estimates, whereas right now I might negotiate down a bit to just get it over with. If there are ongoing issues with the car, I think now is the time to state for the record I thought the car should of been totaled from the beginning. At least then I can say ""I told you so,"" and your adjuster was off by somewhere near 25% (incompetent or grossly negligent estimate)."
4255,"April 19, 2014  5:38PM",andres3," Finally got the first supplemental estimate: Just north of $20K!!!! Still, well below totaling even with 15% DV and $1,405 rental costs. However, I find being off (first estimate was $15.5K) by so much, makes me think someone wasn't being honest with themselves early on. I know supplements are common, but one of nearly 25% extra? 28 day time estimate is way off too. Looks like it'll be 1 month and 4 days if they let me pick up next Tuesday."

4257,"April 24, 2014  8:44PM",andres3,"So I got in a fight with my insurance company; I believe they've turned on me and they have 3 strikes in my book now. They found out the impacted tire wouldn't balance on the wheel and had to be replaced. They tried to get away with only replacing 1 tire saying the car only had 4,200 miles. I pointed out to Geico that they were deviating from the Owner's manual and Audi specifications that recommend replacing all 4 tires, but under no circumstances should tires be replaced in less than pairs on the front and/or rear axle. They must be within 2 MM to meet spec from front to rear. After sending a semi-nasty letter to Gieco, they realized the error of their ways, and said they'd pay for 80% of 2 tires, but 20% betterment charge to me (they are within the 2 mm spec. 20% betterment when staggered tires (2/32nd's difference) will result in reduced or at least altered performance? NO THANK YOU. Also, I won't get any betterment because I'm not going to double my maintenance frequency and hassle changing 2 tires at a time, especially when the manual says running different size tires (circumference) will result in reduced handling."
4258,"April 24, 2014 10:00PM",m6user,If I were your insurance company I would have the tire shop shave a tire to match up with your present tires and tell you you're good to go. IMO asking for 4 new tires where only one is damaged when the car has only 4200 miles is a reach. Why would you have to double your maint. frequency if the tires are within the 2mm spec. anyway?

It will have a 9-speed DCT trans. Whereas the 3.5L will have an 8-speed trans. Rumor is the 4 cyl and 6 cyl base cars will offer P-AWS-4 wheel steer from the RLX. The SH AWD will still be available but it's significantly lighter than before. Interesting to note, the new TLX is supposed to be a 1/2 second faster to 60....pretty significant. That puts it smack dab in the middle of the lux/performance cars we always talk about here...like the IS350, Audi S4, BMW 335i, Infiniti G/Q.

4266,"April 14, 2014  8:59PM",markcincinnati,"Acura TLX There are (were) many good things to be said (and enjoyed) about the current TL SH-AWD (in Advance trim) -- trouble is (was) I often found myself ""apologizing"" for the Acura's styling and ""cheap looking"" (for the class it was aspiring to compete in) ""over-Honda-ized"" interior. The concept version is quite the step up in the styling department; but, I think the same can be said for the Infiniti Q50, too. And, well, talk about piling on -- the Q50 can't get NO love from NOBODY, well maybe a little bit from Popular Mechanics. I did then and still do today liken the TL in SH-AWD Advance form as Acura's S4 (for a lot less $). Now that I have a '14 S4, I do appreciate it [the S4] even more -- but the inherent goodness of the TL SH-AWD remains and, hopefully, will continue and grow in the updated TLX. If the price of the TLX SH-AWD Advance can stay under $50K, it ought to be a winner just so long as it [the TLX] doesn't lose the performance bits and driver involvement of the outgoing TL (this -- reduced driver involvement -- seems to be the main complaint about the Q50, as I recall). I had thought Acura had all but given up wanting to compete with the premium Germans and the other premium Japanese offerings. It would seem the TLX could knock the Q50 to last place and maybe even breathe down the IS 350's neck (assuming the Acura in FWD trim is not compared with the IS in either rear or AWD configuration). Perhaps things will get interesting again -- it was starting (for a while there) to look like the IS was going to be the only current Japanese Premium sporty sedan. This new TLX SH-AWD could turn the corner and the tide for that matter. I'll probably not make any friends for saying this, but: in this class (A4, 3 series, C Class, ATS, IS, Q50 etc), there should be NO FWD only models (unless and only unless a customer wants to special order one). Yes, I know the A4 is offered in an FWD configuration (somewhere) -- but of the 5 or so Audi dealers I am aware of there are NO, ZERO, NONE, NADDA, FWD A4's (I don't even know if you could order one if you tried) available and the dealers have no intention of ever having one (again, assuming you can get one, even.) The new A3 and the new ""baby Benz 4-door coupe"" may come as FWD models and the dealer body may elect to stock a few to attract more potential (and younger, perhaps?) customers, and that is fine. But at the ELLPS (Premium models) RWD and/or AWD are expected -- and here in Cincinnati AWD BMW's look to overtake the RWD versions soon if they haven't already (and the AWD trend is thus in Mercedes, Cadillac, Infiniti and Lexus for many models). Having the TLX offered with FWD makes a statement -- something like ""take the 'P' out of ELLPS."" I would think it is a message Acura doesn't want to promote (given the overwhelming success -- he said sarcastically -- of the FWD RLX.) In our fair city, the Honda dealership is ""real close"" (geographically) to the Acura store -- I would think some would shop a Honda after seeing the sticker on an FWD TLX. The TLX needs to make at least good run at being a performance model -- and it will be hard pressed, today, to do that as a front driver. Of course, I could be wrong -- just not uncertain. DILYL"

4268,"April 14, 2014  9:23PM",graphicguy,"Mark...as always, appreciate your thoughts. Of course, the proof is in the pudding. We won't know what it's like to drive until they hit the streets (May?). My dealer usually has big, invitation only rollouts with fanfare when a new model comes out. They have a string quartet, champagne, canapés, etc. They then have some of the new models for brief test drives. Last one I did was for the RLX (another nice car that's getting little love). You're an Audi aficionado. I'm a little jaded because of what happened with mine. That shouldn't detract from your obvious love of the ones you've had, and continue to have. I'm an Acura aficinado. Through BMWs, Audis, Cadillacs, etc, my Acuras are still among the best cars I've ever owned....and, like you, I've owned quite a few. Your Audi is based on a FWD architecture. Yes, Quattro alleviates much of the FWD understeer. Still, day=to-day driving? You, me, anyone else would be hard pressed to say which wheels are motivating the car. They've become quite good at taming those bugaboos. On paper at least, it looks like the new TLX will have what the Acura folks have been clamoring for. While the 4 cyl will get the lion's share of volume, I'm more interested in the SH-AWD version, as always. Sticking to the formula of Good/Better/Best (standard/Tech/Advance) I just confirmed with the dealer that the Advance I'll be looking at will come in right around that $49K range (current Advance is $48K and change). 0-60 in 5 sec, Torque vectoring AWD, upgraded materials everywhere, lighter, LED headlights/tailights, high zoot stereo, sports leather seating, blind spot warning, integrated NAV that actually works right (and Siri enabled to fully integrate my iPhone), a little bit of this, a little more of that, at that price? Yep, it's at the top of my shopping list."
4269,"April 15, 2014  2:00AM",dash5,"For me the TLX looks great on paper and I like the styling of the prototype. There were a few spy shots that were not very flattering, but overall I'm happy with what I see so far. The next big hurdle is the interior. I know we'll see that this week at the Auto Show here in NYC, maybe I should stop by myself come to think of it! Having looked at a TL in 2011 when I was last in the market, the interior, beak and that... boomerang thing... on the trunk, drove me away. This time they're seemingly on the right track."
4270,"April 15, 2014  2:25AM",markcincinnati,"Is there anyplace (on the web?) where the number of FWD vs Quattro Audis sold in the US can be found? I've been to Audi dealers in Dallas and there were NO FWD cars other than a TT and the previous model A3 on the lot -- AWD appears NOT to be a regional issue. The highest performance Porsches and Lambos (and even some other Italian exotics) are AWD are they not? I know that I am an Audi-biased and even German car-biased person, but I would really like to know if there are any significant number (%) of FWD Audis of any configuration sold in the US -- something (maybe emotion) tells me the number of FWD A4s, 6s. 8s, etc sold are in the single digits (%). I think it would be difficult for Audi to have achieved -- after decades and the unintended acceleration setback -- Premium status if the cars were in any significant volume FWD. This FWD issue is a problem for Acura. In the ""old days"" you needed to at least have ONE V8 in your lineup to be considered Premium; these days volumetric efficiency seems to have become an acceptable alternative to displacement, but there are Premium class identifiers that Acura seemed, for a time, to embrace and recently they seem to eschew. They may very well be reliable and durable, but they need to be more difficult to be distinguished from their more humble Honda roots. Audis, for years, were often said to be ""higher cost Vw's"" -- an A4 (called an Audi 4000 on this side of the Atlantic) was somewhat of a hard sell compared to a Passat (called a Quantum) when the Quantum had an Audi 5 cylinder while the Audi had to settle for a four-cylinder. Only when Audi decided to de-VW its cars did it begin to get the respect and pricing power to be in the premium class. Acura has (until today, hopefully) had way too much Honda in their cars -- placing them at the same place Audi was about 20 years ago. It's time for Acura to get serious, eschewing FWD in the TLX would be a good start-- Acura needs to piss or get off the pot, in crude terms, to be blunt. Of course, well, you know . . . . but never uncertain. Drive It Like You Live."

Considering most high end models are AWD standard, dollar figure may be different. I think even in Florida AWD is creeping up, but probably much slower than in other parts of the country."
4272,"April 15, 2014  2:53AM",dino001,"Just looked at local dealer inventory. It is a sample of one, one point of time. The A4 on the lot are 2:1 for AWD, so it seems its market share had already crept up."
4273,"April 15, 2014  3:51AM",andres3,"Audi thinks Americans are dumb enough to get a FWD A3 with the mediocre 1.8T rather than the very good 2.0T Quattro A3. Not only is the 1.8T down on HP and torque, but it also guzzles more fossil fuel than the 2.0T. And that is DESPITE the weight and efficiency disadvantage of the bigger engine and Quattro vs. FWD. The 1.8 FWD needs to be retired."
4274,"April 15, 2014  4:31AM",stickguy,"where are you getting this on the 1.8? It isn't the old 1.8T motor, it is the new one that is in the Jetta and Passat now. Which is rated quite a bit higher than the 2.0T in the same model. a little less power true, but not much slower and does run on RUG."
4275,"April 15, 2014 12:03PM",graphicguy,"Mark....The FWD A4s and A6s are price leaders. And, as has been mentioned, it's also a regional thing, too. In the sunny states, it's a rarity of find 4WD/AWD anything. Fact is, any Quattro A4/6 has it's beginnings as a FWD platform, just like SH AWD Acuras have their beginnings on FWD platforms. I did rent a Jetta earlier this year. There are similarities to Audi...certain switches, handles, styling (especially the center stack and dash), etc. However, this is true for many brands. I don't see GM making different window switches for Cadillac when they can use the ones from Buick, just as one example. Is a Honda a ""humble"" basis for an Acura? I dunno....depends on how you look at it. An Accord is certainly a very good starting point for an Acura. I'm excited about the upcoming TLX. As I normally do, if in a couple of years, I decide to make a trade, the TLX will be tops on my list. That's based on my experiences with both the S4 and the TL SH AWD. Does that make the S4 a bad car? No, not by a long stretch. It didn't work out all that well for me, and that may mean I have my own biases. But, that shouldn't and hasn't dissuaded you. We'll wait and see what is unveiled today. I've seen the prototype pics. Acura is pretty good at sticking to pre-release versions of their production models. I like what I've seen. Then again, I liked the previous design, too. 5-sec 0-60, SH AWD, torque vectoring rear, 9 speed trans, Honda reliability, coming in at roughly $10K less than either a 335i or S4 equipped like for like, there's lots to love there."
4276,"April 15, 2014 12:47PM",markcincinnati,"Do the Manufacturers read our rants and raves? I shared the story of the S4 that couldn't (or wouldn't) be made right with my lawyer wife. The first thing she said was ""doesn't someone from Audi read the comments on Edmunds and Audiworld?"" She elaborated that it appears that it would be less expensive to have simply replaced the un-fixable S4 rather than have the story be posted in no small amount of detail on the web. My own questions have to do somewhat with the dealer -- who was paid at the time of sale and is paid for warranty work. You'd think the dealer, who apparently is not losing any money on this customer would be interested in going the distance to get the customer's issue resolved. If the dealer was bleeding dollar bills, I could almost understand their reluctance to throw more money (mostly represented, I would assume, by time) at the problem. Audi (and others) must have interns that read our posts, maybe even computer programs that comb the Internet looking for keywords (the Audi spiders?) and bringing stories to the attention of said interns. Unless they don't have such interns or programs, it would seem valuable -- in marketing terms alone -- to have addressed the ailing S4's issues rather than seeing them escalate to the point that the customer gives up in frustration. I mean it was not like there were ""attacks"" or rants (without substantiation) posted; no name calling, etc. So for the wholesale cost of a new car the customer good-will would have, I can imagine, offset the ill-will and frustration laid out here for all to see. The question stands -- do the manufacturers have folks who monitor what we write about their products and when there seems to be a less than positive issue, intervene? On the subject of separation (by Audi from VW or by Infiniti from Nissan, for instance), it does indeed appear that when the Premium car maximizes its separation from the more humble ""parent"" they both win. Porsche, still in not very old memory, was building a number of cars that shared way too many VW components -- and those cars were damn near crucified by the motor reviewing press (and customers). Porsche virtually stopped this practice and the market responded positively. These days there are still parts sharing (between and among car company's cousins), but when the Audi division began to separate itself further and further from VW, Audi's market and machines improved significantly. On the other side of this, Infiniti's G is born with RWD, I know of no Nissan analog, ditto the M -- but the JX was brought to market so quickly Infiniti had to base it on a Nissan product (FWD no less), and despite the JX's success (or lack of), it is probably not one of Infiniti's shining moments in marketing or manufactuing. BMW has no sub-BMW division or parent which can be said to be a strength, but also may put BMW in a precarious position in the future as we see the global consolidation of car companies gather momentum. Once there were 88, soon there may only be one-quarter that number [sic]."
4277,"April 15, 2014  1:52PM",graphicguy,"Mark....you're preaching to the converted. It confounds me to no end the lengths some car manufacturers will go to keep from finding their products at fault. The recent GM ignition switch debacle is just the latest. IF you have a problem, fix it. If you can't fix it, replace it. If neither of those work....""here you go Mr/Ms customer....here's a check. We're sorry for the inconvenience. We hope to see you again under better circumstances"". I think in my case, it was the Regional Rep who really was the ""putz"". While I had electronic gremlins that could have been alleviated with new ""parts"" (ones which they made a point of telling me were uber expensive), the really bothersome issue was the Quattro binding. I drove with them. They experienced the issue....admitted as much. Something electro-mechanical was amiss. After all the potential ""cheap"" fixes were exhausted, they turned to the mantra ""just bring it back when it totally leaves you stranded somewhere"". 2nd problem was how they drug their feet in making a decision on how to proceed. Yes, I had their loaner cars. But, I wanted MY CAR. Then, the Regional Manager tried to do a dance around the issue, denying any problems whatsoever (regardless of the obvious, clearly demonstrable issues). As the old adage goes...""you only get one chance to make a good first impression"". Audi kind of blew that with me. The two companies that I've had the utmost positive customer service with has been Acura and BMW. Probably more of a reflection of the individual dealerships than anything else. But, both have gone out of their way to make sure I was happy with my ownership experiences. After years of not being loyal to any one manufacturer, it's becoming more of a priority for me to deal with the car companies that gives me the best customer service. Of course, to get me in the door to begin with, I have to like their products. Again, no condemnation of your love of Audis. Your experiences have just been different than mine."
4278,"April 15, 2014  2:43PM",dino001," The short answer is no. The long answer is no. They don't care. As long as the sales are going up, they think everything is better than ever. Regarding your dealer appearing disinterested in fixing your car, one possible explanation is that the manufacturer pays them just enough to break even on simple clear-cut issue (remove X, put new part back), but they may not get enough money to pay for diagnostic effort required when complex systems are involved. Then there may be manufacturers policy of putting head into sand when it comes to some issues, like MMI and such. If it's not direct safety (where they may get a big slap from media and/or government), they get less incentive to actually make it work. Moreover, complex electronic infotainment systems have a standing ""beta version"" stance. My observation is anytime software is involved, the sellers have some kind of indemnity - all those lengthy and unfair terms of use basically allow them to charge full price for a developmental product. So it goes like that: what da ya want - it's new, complex, it's gremlins, I dunno notin'."
4279,"April 15, 2014  3:24PM",m6user,"I've seen many posts from GM customer service on brand specific Edmunds forums and I think also on the midsize cars forum. So, at least one manufacturer does read the forums. So the simple answer is yes some do. I'm sure some do but don't go as far as actually post. Now, why does GM do it and overtly at that? I don't know. One would like to think that they are trying to improve and/or fix product. But it may just be to cut potential lawsuits off at the pass. Obviously, it hasn't worked perfectly......much like their vehicles."
4280,"April 15, 2014  4:18PM",graphicguy,"dino....you are so right. I can't remember how many times I'd call the dealer to ask the status of my repairs. After several days....the answers would be something along the lines of....""we haven't received instructions on how to fix your Audi"", or....""we're waiting for parts. Might take another week"". Or, ""we haven't been given the 'go-ahead' to fix your car"". How is this possible? The car was a year into the alleged ""bumper-to-bumper"" warranty. What's to authorize? You fix it. One of the reasons I won't buy a Cadillac was the way they treated my late Mother. This was several years ago, but my Mother had bought an STS brand new. Granted, her only driving was to the hair dresser, the grocery store, the pharmacy, church on Sunday....LITERALLY A CAR DRIVEN BY A LITTLE OLD LADY. It may sit for a day or two, but it was driven at least 3-4 times/week. It kept draining the battery. Cadillac dealer kept replacing the battery. A week or two after the new one was installed, it would go dead. GM started doing the ""hokey-pokey"" with my Mother...blaming her for not driving it enough. So, she and I swapped cars. I drove her Caddy every day. Same thing happened when I drove it. After having it towed yet again to the 3rd Caddy dealer to see if they could fix it, they authorized a new battery as the ""fix"". I asked the service manager if it didn't make more sense to do a diagnostics on the electrical system to see WHY the battery was being drained. He said all GM would reimburse them for was a battery replacement. GM ended up eating that car after there was such a huge surge in the electrical system that the rear window defroster actually ""blew out"" the rear window after the surge. When the buy back was authorized, I took the Caddy to the selling dealer as GM instructed. Dropping off the keys to the GM of the dealership, he said he wished he had never sold the car to my Mother. Know what? So am I. That attitude has kept me away from the brand ever since."
4281,"April 15, 2014  4:47PM",markcincinnati,"For the record, it [the Audi S4 issue] was NOT my Audi. As I have stated to distraction, between my personal cars, company paid-for cars and my wife's cars, we've had, er, 31 Audis in our garage since late 1977. They have not all been perfect. Yet, there has never been a problem that Audi has NOT stepped up and fixed (and only one time did an Audi factory rep take a look at one of my cars, and his response was to authorize all new rotors for my braking vibration issues.) I am NOT suggesting that I know some inside information -- but how do we know the mfgrs aren't paying attention to these posts (and posts made elsewhere)? I would think the almost 100% vertical ""rise in importance"" of social media would virtually dictate that the mfgrs monitor the WWW for blogs, rants, raves, posts, tweets and so on. It just doesn't seem likely we are just chatting with each other and that what we say is not even some small part of the mix of ""market research"" and data points that so many companies covet and spend governmental sums to acquire. We, all of us collectively (via ""the vivid awareness of the relationship between personal experience and the wider society"", C. Wright Mills), can [potentially] ""move markets"" -- especially and unfortunately somewhat easily in the negative, more so than the positive. Imagine if ""we all"" wrote nothing but ""hater"" tales about the ""DeSoto"" -- you know, pick one car or car company (we could all pile on GM in light of its recent bad publicity, for example) -- that could be dozens (or perhaps thousands) of taste makers in a short time telling the world that ""this [DeSoto] product"" sucks, under-performs, costs too much, drinks gas or costs a young fortune to maintain and spends more time in the dealer's garage than the owner's, for instance. I would think once what we wrote was posted here and subsequently quoted or re-posted on Facebook or any social media outlet of note, the crud would hit the fan. It seems ""obvious"" (to me) that the mfgrs must be observing what is being said and weighing the requirements to react and/or respond. I'm probably giving them too much credit -- maybe."

4285,"April 16, 2014  2:29AM",Michaell,"Back to ELLPS ... I've got a question. It's been assumed that, from the start of this thread, that ELLPS refers to models such as the 3-series, C-class, A4, etc. Now that there is a 2-series (OK, this is a coupe only at the moment, but I figure the 2-series ""gran coupe"" is just around the corner), the CLA-class and the new A3, what do we call them? Are they the new ELLPS, and the old (larger) ones now need a new name?"
4286,"April 16, 2014  2:59AM",sweendogy,Good question @michael@edmunds. I would say its always been up to the moderator- acura has had 2 cars here from the beginning and my argument was/is the tsx really Ellps? Obv the word sedan needs to be addressed but I think you need a pricing band- say 30-40k starter (obv that is a huge range but it's something) - and it has to be somewhat sporty - we can all agree the Lexus ES and other fwd rebaged cars should not.
4287,"April 16, 2014  3:23AM",stickguy,"I think both can coexist, as long as the bigger models don't go too far upscale. So A3/A4, TSX/TL, are both close enough. Not sure there are really any others?"
4288,"April 16, 2014  3:48PM",markcincinnati,"A3, CLA, 2-Series and who knows what else will come forth? This forum, nominally, is the Entry-Level LPS forum. There is, of course, also an LPS forum. These names were fine when there was no CLA, A3, and etc. Now, we have more ""creep"" by several mfgs -- the new Mercedes C class is a big move up in its ""Premium-ness"", and even though the A4 (Audi's B class) was born in 2008, it too has upped its luxury content, and one can imagine that the upcoming calendar year 2015 A4 will take a page out of the A3's book and be pushed further upscale. The new TLX (just coming to market) is, from the pictures at least, a big step up, and the same is the case (mostly) for the other ELLPS cars. I never understood what justified the Acura TSX's inclusion as an ELLPS but I accepted it as a moderator's choice that just stuck. A discussion forum here has a pretty wide latitude for discourse when there are multiple ostensibly competing cars to be commented on -- and that is fine with me. I do think, however, that the forums that include multiple cars should include cars that are typically cross shopped. Example: I might have test driven a Ford Taurus SHO when I was looking to replace my TL SH-AWD; but this event was most likely an anomaly. The Taurus SHO is not an ELLPS by any definition I can think of, nor is it, despite its girth, a candidate for the LPS forum. Therefore, at this point, the A3 and CLA and whatever else comes out BELOW the current A4, 3 Series, TLX, S60, IS, Q50 and so on should merit their own forum. The other day, I was at my Audi dealer, looking at a heavily optioned A3 Premium+ (there is one step up from that , it is called Prestige, and one might argue the upcoming S3 might up the ante even furhter). The thing was somewhat MORE expensive than a stripped A4 Premium (quattro) model. For the time being, perhaps, folks may cross shop the NEW A3 with the OLD A4 -- the replacement A4 however will, presumably, dissipate the overlap, if not always in price, certainly in its ability to be perceived as distinctly ""more premium"" than even the top o' the heap A3. In any case, unless we want these forums to devolve into ""anything goes"", my vote is to put this new crop of sub-ELLPS cars into their own forum, perhaps something like Premium Sporty Compacts, PSC for short, or Sporty Premium Compacts, SPC, pick something, anything, just not ELLPS unless we make a new class in between ELLPS and LPS.

4324,"February 27, 2014  2:45AM",sweendogy,"@markcincinnati - like I mentioned I got the 13 s4, mine has the sports diff and audi select- the SD is not noticeable 90% or more of the time under normal conditions - in reading other post enthusiast love it- me I'm not totally sold that its a must have but for the extra 1k on a 55-60k car I could see wanting it- the prestige package for me is just a bunch of small extras that do nothing for performance and are just for added lux. I've only had my car for 2 weeks- will say with snow tires its a bull. Hills and turns not an issue even in 6 inches of loose snow. The car with snows is noisier then the old G was - but it does get 4-5 mpg better in my limited time in mixed driving. I drive mostly in individual mode- I set the exhaust to be dynamic (infinit standard), steering dynamic and engine in auto. I've also set the speed limit alert to 80mph as its very easy to miss given the small readout- I've also found the digital speedo to be extremely helpful- I have the V1 hard mounted near the passenger visor as well. Excited about the car and a bit worried about the German gremlins that maybe hiding."
4325,"February 27, 2014  2:57AM",sweendogy,@stickguy I like the new feature to add pix- but badges really? I don't need no stinking badges....
4326,"February 27, 2014  2:59PM",markcincinnati,"@sweendogy: I read an article about the ""individual"" settings that suggested the steering will perform at its best if set to Auto. I can't seem to locate the article, but I know it was in a fairly recent Car & Driver or Automobile or Road & Track, since those are the publications I subscribe to. I don't know if I can honestly tell much of a difference, but for what it's worth, I set mine to Dynamic, Auto & Comfort (engine/transmission, steering, exhaust sound, respectively). The primary (perhaps the ONLY) difference with the engine/transmission setting at dynamic is that the transmission will default to S mode which seems to hold in gear longer before upshift, perform obvious rev matches during downshifts and make the ""fart"" sound on upshifts more aggressive (hence my setting of ""comfort"" for the engine sound). Now that I have passed 5,000 miles I am noticing better gas mileage, improved performance and a feeling of ""less friction"" overall. I had really missed the cruise control in the Audi -- when I set the CC to, say, 45MPH in the Acura TL SH-AWD and then find myself going down a rather steep hill seeing a curve at the bottom, the Acura would start freewheeling, so to speak and pick up more and more speed (based on the grade). Then, to negotiate the turn, I would have to brake -- which turned the cruise control off, of course. In the Audi, set the CC for 45MPH and go down a virtual vertical drop and the CC holds the speed at 45MPH, period. Then when reaching the base of the downhill, I can negotiate the curve without killing the cruise control. It is a little thing, perhaps for some people. But my 2005 A6 and 2009 A4 had this feature and my 2011 Infiniti and 2012 Acura did not -- it seemed [on those Japanese premium cars] like a huge oversight. Another thing I like about the Audi CC is if you've set it, say, at 75MPH and you come into a heavily monitored construction zone where the speed limit is reduced to 55MPH, you can toggle the CC stalk to 55 and the car brakes and resets itself at 55. With the Acura, for instance, you could only coast down or apply the brakes yourself. I know there will be folks who are dead set against the car having this much ""intelligence"" or autonomy (and this ain't THAT much, folks), but it can simply be turned off if you don't want to ""enjoy"" a tiny bit smarter cruise control. In any case, I keep forgetting just how much technology comes with these German cars -- and how it does its best to help you not get ticketed and remain in control. I give this feature alone an ""A"" for its contribution to safety. DILYL"
4327,"February 27, 2014  3:08PM",Michaell," My wife's Mazda CX-7 does that as well ... will automatically downshift the automatic transmission to a lower gear to maintain the set speed on CC when going down hills. I agree, it's a nice feature to have - especially here in Colorado, where we have a fair amount of elevation change on the roads."
4328,"February 27, 2014  5:05PM",flightnurse," My BMW does this as well, infact when the car applys the brakes the brakes lights come on. I have been traveling between Phoenix and San Diego quite a bite as my father was in the hospital, and found this feature very helpful. I wonder why Acura do not do this.."
4329,"February 27, 2014  8:10PM",markcincinnati,"The Audi's backup camera screen shows trajectory lines that ""curve"" as the steering wheel is turned. The Acura? Straight lines, no curve, no match to steering wheel inputs. Now, the Infiniti, it had front camera and rear camera and trajectory lines when the car was in reverse and drive -- of course, it also had the wonderful, fantastic, gotta have it, around-view monitor. Of course now both Audi and BMW offer this tech, but it is still not universal. Of course, I recently read an article about how many times backup camera adoption has been pushed to a future year -- I guess we should feel good that the German and Japanese (premium) cars typically come standard with such tech and that it is pretty much ""available"" on the lesser cars from that mfgr. Looks like backup cameras are ""probably"" going to be required as of January 2015 -- but don't hold your breath. By the time the backup camera is a requirement, the all-around or top-view systems will be the norm in the premium segment. If you've not seen what an all-around top-view, etc, set-up can do, check out your nearest Infiniti showroom -- this is seriously cool tech that makes driving and parking in tight spaces, oh, only about a MILLION PERCENT easier and safer! I graduated from college in 1973 (yep, I am old) and I took a course in 1971 where a new technology was introduced (in a Chrysler, no less): anti-lock brakes. 1971. Let that sink in -- the first car I was personally aware of that could actually have ABS as it came to be called was a 1985 model year BMW ""7"" series which, as I recall, came to the US market in calendar 1984. What in the wide-wide world of sports took 13 years [for anti-lock brakes] to go from Chrysler (std equipment on the gas-turbine car they produced) to BMW (probably sourced from Bosch). The year following, ABS was offered on the Audi 200 (US name 5000S) quattro (and probably the FWD version too for that matter.) Yet, when was it that mere mortals could get ABS on their Blue Ovals and Bow Ties? It seems like it took decades! Of course it took another automotive eternity to make ESP widely available, too. To a certain extent Audi took a helluva long time to bring ""torque vectoring"" (aka ""sport differential"") to market -- doing so, I believe, sometime after Acura announced their version of torque vectoring with the mouthful of a name -- SH-AWD. I've had ABS, ESP, TPMS, sat nav, voice activation, blind spot monitoring, bi-xenon head-lights (except for the Acura), back-up or all-around view cameras and monitors and a whole host of other ""ought to be standard equipment"" stuff for longer than I can remember (and it is not -- yet -- due to a fading memory); this stuff is very cheap to make and probably all of this technology can fit in the space of one chip, with room to spare, these days. Why does the trickle down or even just the offering of the technology move at glacial speed for pity's sake? Another technology that ""ought to be standard"" is the 7, 8 or 9 (or more) speed transmission. I believe a base 4-cylinder 2010 Audi A4 was offered with an 8-speed tiptronic transmission; and, I believe every or virtually every BMW can be had with an 8 speed unit, too. The 8-speed's reason for being is economy and performance, yes? Why didn't Chevy -- to name one -- do what these Germans did: go to ZF and buy the 8-speed units and tout their benefits in their brand new Impalas and SS's and, same question for Ford. The efficiency and performance gains alone should have made this worth doing -- instead we've got a whole bunch of new ""made in the USA"" cars with ""old"" 6-speed transmissions. Rhode Island is neither a road nor an island. . . discuss amongst yourselves. DILYL"

Now did you know the Oldsmobile was the first US manufacture to have an Airbag as an option in the 70's. Needless to say, not many where sold... I thought Lexus was the first manufacture to come out with the 8 spd in the LS430. I do agree with you Mark that US automakers really needed to see the benefit of the 8 or 9 spd auto.

4332,"February 28, 2014  3:26AM",Mr_Shiftright,"That's right--1971 Chrysler Imperial had ABS on all 4 wheels. And apparently, it worked quite well."
4333,"February 28, 2014  3:19PM",markcincinnati,"Glad to see ""us"" scratching our heads wondering why the nearly 13 year gap between working ABS in a Chrysler (I think it was only 2-channel ABS, but hey it worked) and the German's putting it in their top of the line models. I had a 1986 Audi 5000CS quattro and it had ABS -- indeed, it had an ""off on"" ABS switch on the dash. The owner's manual explained when ABS worked and when it was best to turn it off. Of course they took the switch away when they found out that sometimes people would turn ABS off at inappropriate times because they thought there was something wrong with their brakes since they ""pulsed"" when ABS was activated. A case of ignorance winning out over technology. According to the owner's manual, you should turn your ABS off when driving in deep gravel or deep not packed (fluffy) snow, since you could use a locked wheel/tire to slow you down in deep gravel since a mound of gravel would pile up under the tires rapidly shedding speed. The mound-ing effect was cancelled by the action of the ABS, making the stopping more difficult in deep snow or gravel. In any case, my confusion and perhaps even frustration is with the slow adoption of tech that is actually very inexpensive. And American mfgrs are some of the worst offenders. Hell, they'll jump on putting power windows in an el cheapo car, but delay for decades incorporating ABS, ESP, blind spot monitoring, etc etc etc. I would assume the cost of the hardware for power windows, power sunroofs and power door locks is more than the cost of a backup camera and blind spot monitoring, for example. I'm pretty confident that the reason for the delay has something to do with perceived demand, costs and what the mfgr must see as their customers' perception of the value of such tech. To me, this [safety and/or performance and/or convenience] tech is almost essential any more. Even though I think factory sat nav is outrageously priced, I wouldn't leave home without it -- but c'mon to add ""MMI"" to an Audi is $3,500 -- and for that you get sat nav, bluetooth and voice activation of several of the car's systems -- all nicely integrated. This has to provide Audi with a super high gross margin -- and, even knowing that, the majority of cars my Audi dealer sells (which are overwhelmingly Q5s and A4s) come with MMI, ""because that's what people want."" Maybe things like ABS, when they were a $500 option, just didn't seem sexy enough, no matter how little it cost. Of course, now we're moving into a whole new era of auto tech -- autonomy. . . .

4334,"February 28, 2014  6:56PM",dino001,"I think the issue was perception of safety as a priority. At that time it was not not perceived as such and stereo or power windows sold well, whereas ABS or airbags were considered ""fluff"". There were many examples of drivers choosing entertainment, or convenience options over safety when it was done as an alternative of ""free upgrade"", or simple limit of total price. It changed today, but it is still expected to be ""free"". In other words ABS or stability control should be ""free"" (i.e. included in price that is same as last year model), but leather or premium stereo, no problem as an option. To best see how peoples' preferences changed is to watch evolution of Toyota cars. Toyota has almost six sense, when it comes to timing standard inclusion of equipment in the model vs. market demands. When Toyota offers something standard, it means the segment requires that as such. When it is still an expensive option, it means people will either be willing to pay extra or so without it. Detroit (GM especially) had an opposite problem - wrong timing. They'd put something on when nobody saw that necessary (e.g. ABS on Cavalier), but later they'd remove it when market was just about to demand it."

To be fair though the American companies have introduced a lot of technology in the lower end of the market first ( Chrysler with at least a driver side air bag in pretty much every car they sold way before anybody else put them in standard) and GM with ABS in the Cavalier as already mentioned, and I think they were one of the first with traction control as standard in some lower end cars as well ( grand ams for instance). At least there is no longer an Americans car to hat I know off that still comes with a four speed transmission ( unlike Toyota). The eight, nine, and ten speed transmissions are coming from the us manufactures, but it takes time to not only develop them, but to get suppliers to make the parts, and factories tooled to get them built, and to figure out how to make it cost effective to put them in lower end models, they aren't free after all. And why just pick on the American manufactures, where are the eight + speeds in the Japanese ( and even the German ) mainstream line up, some of them still only have 5 speeds in most of their line up. And Chrysler is the one who is offering eight and nine speed transmissions in their lower end cars first, so it is a little unfair to say that the American manufactures are putting technology in their cars, on the other hand I do agree that their high end models ( I.e. Cadillac and Lincoln at least) should have had this technology within a year or two of it appearing on the German makes, and I don't recall that happening so in that respect you are correct."

My previous A4 had the 19"" 35 series tires (and the sport suspension, too) -- you were aware of every grain of sand on the road. The 18""s are 40 series, which are somewhat better since the sidewalls aren't quite as stiff and there is a bit more cushion between you and the road, given the higher/taller aspect ratio. The potholes here in Cincinnati have multiplied like rabbits this year -- I dread the almost unavoidable consequences of hitting one. Last time I did that it cost me one new wheel and four new tires. On an Audi, everything is breathtakingly expensive. We're talking a number beginning with a 2 -- yikes! Damn potholes. When I cruise down the highway with these tires, there is very little road noise and, being that the tire sidewalls are only stiff, not super-stiff, the ride is actually not an issue. I do, however, have the upgraded seats, which probably account for part of the comfort, too.

My wise-guy friend claims, even though Audi engines, transmissions and sumptuous interiors are either proclaimed by the motoring press to be “the best” or at least “tied for the top,” Audis remain soul-less machines, sorely lacking the all-important emotional hook to keep “serious” car people interested and perhaps entertained. They (Audis) are extremely competent and confidence inspiring pieces of machinery, but they somehow are not the stuff that inspires passionate prose – even though they are often the winners of three, four and five-way motoring press “comparo” reports. Although I, apparently, am in the minority who do not doubt Audi’s soul can be seen, heard and felt in its cars, I now present an S4 update now that I have passed 5,000 miles – much of it being driven in sub-freezing weather and on snow and ice-covered roads. The Audi in question is an Ibis white 2014 S4 Premium Plus model with the 7-speed S-Tronic transmission, 18” wheels shod with all-season tires, MMI/Navigation+, B&O audio, Magma Red Napa leather seats, carbon fiber trim, Audi side assist and Audi Care.

Of course now that I know how inexpensive the sport differential is, I should have insisted on getting that, too. With shipping and Audi Care, the pre-tax price was $57+K. As a member of the Audi Club of North America, I got an “automatic” 6% off the sticker, and as an Ohio resident, had to pay 6.5% sales tax. I put no money down and leased the car. I plan to buy the car and the Audi extended service package, if it proves itself to be as durable as it is fun to drive. I believe there is a way, too, to CPO my own car (for a price) giving me a warranty to 100,000 miles. At 5,000 miles the first service – basically an inspection and an oil and filter change – is required, subsequent service intervals are 10,000 miles. First off, the car has had no issues of any kind beyond a flat tire which only required a patch to remedy. Even on the coldest mornings (minus 11 F), starting was no problem and since I have heated seats there was only short-lived temperature discomfort. My butt was quickly warmed up, that is. Second, the S4 with the S-Tronic transmission is beyond a pleasure to drive – it goes all the way to fun to drive coupled with a boatload of confidence inspiration. The engine, transmission, brake and steering combination work together so well they have convinced me they are telepathic, responding to my foot and hand commands in real time. There is no latency: Press the accelerator and the car doesn’t pause that millisecond every other car I have ever had did, indeed it seems to accelerate almost a millisecond before my brain receives the confirmation from my foot that the pedal has been pressed. The paddle shifters, too, act, they don’t react – when I ask for an upshift, the speed at which the next highest gear is selected is faster (and smoother) even than the best manual transmission upshift, I could ever pull off. And, I should also tell you that the brakes slow or stop the car with such speed and control it is as if I had hit a giant, super-thick foam rubber wall. Finally, the S4 goes where you point it, when you point it. Body roll is minimal and it corners like a Ken Onion chef’s knife carves a tender beef roast. Other than the unabashed fart-like exhaust sound that accompanies high RPM upshifts, the S4 is very quiet and civilized inside, and the tuneage delivered through the B&O speaker system is sick – although I do miss the extra kick from the sub-woofer in the Acura TL’s DVD-Audio system. This year, Drive Select is standard, and it allows, in Individual mode, the driver to change the characteristics of the engine/transmission, steering and exhaust system sound. Settings generally include Comfort, Auto and Dynamic. I have mine set for Dynamic (engine/transmission), Auto (steering) and Comfort (exhaust note sound), although under full-throttle, even in Comfort mode, the engine growls and the exhaust snorts right on cue whenever the transmission upshifts. I have no intention of taking this (or my wife’s SQ5) to the track, but wrist-watch timed runs from 0 to 60 are, always under 5-seconds. To me, the S4 is a rocket in terms of its quickness; I’ll not be chipping this engine – it doesn’t need it. Time and distance take on entirely new meanings with an S4 – something I do attribute partially to the wonderful (Red) sport seats. Nobody does sport-seats better than Audi. In sum, at 5,000 miles the already quick S4 engine seems to have found and made available about 5% more horsepower and torque from just above idle on to redline. I will look forward to repeating this “+5%” phenomenon again, if all goes as usual, again at 10,000 miles. Perhaps because S4’s are not typically plentiful at your local dealer – there are rarely more than one or two of them at any of the Audi dealers I’ve been to over nearly three decades, they are “outta sight and outta mind” for many premium sport-sedan shoppers. This is a pity, for the S4 is that rare automobile that artfully combines, sport, luxury and a fair amount of practicality (it is in one of American’s most sought after configuration – a four-door sedan) in one fun package. If your auto shopping list currently includes an Acura TLX [coming soon], BMW 335, Infiniti Q50S, Cadillac ATS, Lexus IS 350 F-Sport, Mercedes C-class or Volvo S60 Type-R, you owe it to yourself to take a long test drive in an Audi S4. If money is an object, I would assume a great second choice would be the upcoming TLX, assuming Acura keeps the S4-lite theme of the current TL SH-AWD alive and well. Or, you could get an A4 S-Line and have many of the same goodies that make the S4 such a treat. I’m getting the heck outta here now, while it’s still light out, and I’m going to take the long way home. DILYL"
4369,"February 26, 2014 12:11AM",m6user,"@andys120 I never said anything about an older car with over 100k miles automatically becoming a money pit. What I said was that a well maintained car that age/miles will probably need a couple of repairs equating to a couple of car payments......maybe something like $1000-$1200 per year. That is very reasonable because one, there are no car payments. Two, insurance is cheap as it doesn't pay to carry collision on a car over 10 years old IMO. Three, you don't worry about it in parking lots so much anymore or sliding off the road on ice or snow quite as much. A little less stressful. Probably the most stressful thing is the worry of when the next thing is going to break and is it going to strand you or not. Doesn't bother me so much but I would worry about my wife or daughter having a situation."
4370,"February 26, 2014  1:50AM",nyccarguy,"@roadburner You hit the nail on the head. You budget for repairs & maintenance. Most people don't do that. They pay a car off and don't think about what it is going to cost to keep it on the road for X more years. They just blow their former car payment and then either put the next major repair on a credit card or trade the car in and take out a loan on a new car. A lot of people don't look at big picture things like total cost of ownership, instead choosing to focus on the monthly payment amount."
4371,"February 26, 2014  2:09AM",stickguy,"now that I have inherited my Acura TL back (a 2000 with 174K on the clock) I do enjoy not really caring where I park. With the good cars, I OCD in a parking lot and go way away from other cars when possible. The TL has a few parking lot dings and a lot of scratches (patina?) already, so I don't think I would notice a few more. as to repairs, in the last couple of years it has needed some unexpected ones. But, no collision on it (makes a difference when my 18 YO is the driver assigned to it). Hopefully though nothing big happens, since I want to get some more ""cheap"" use out of it before selling it at the end of the summer."
4372,"February 26, 2014  2:25AM",nyccarguy,"@stickguy Even with the coil packs you had to replace, it was still cheaper than spending $35 - $40K on a new TL. @roadburner Even with the large outlay it cost you when the transfer case blew in the X3, it was still cheaper than shelling out $40 - $50K for a new one. I have a customer who drives a 2005 Porsche Cayenne V6 with 190K miles on it. He can well afford a new Cayenne, but wants to see just how far he can take this one:)"
4373,"February 26, 2014  5:59PM",roadburner,"@nyccarguy Exactly. You have to evaluate all your options in a logical manner. If you go into panic mode you are well and truly screwed. And then there are the people who use the slightest malfunction as an excuse to buy a new car- to ""save"" money, of course..."
4374,"February 26, 2014  6:14PM",laurasdada," Heresy if repeated over on Chronic Car Buyers! Debating what to do about the Lexus, get a second opinion. At a cost, of course. But, will live with it for a while, keep a couple of quarts of high-mileage oil in the trunk, check the dipstick (so nice to have a dipstick!) religiously. Wife would be up for a remanufactured engine, if that's the route we go. She had a coworker who went that route with his Toyota truck, he claimed he got another 100k miles out of the truck post re-engined. Probably limited or no road trips in the Lexus, just local driving, keep it for the utility. If we do re-engine it, at least it is a used car I'm familiar with and know it to be well maintained! Back in my XF, which still looks and smells new. Well, looks new under the winter coat all over the car..."
4375,"February 26, 2014  6:52PM",stickguy,Which Lexus model is this?
4376,"February 26, 2014  7:38PM",Mr_Shiftright,"$1200/yr is a very sober estimate and IMO, very accurate, for out of warranty cars. This presumes it is a car you've owned all its life and that as 100K rolls around, it's pretty much tip top. I've been averaging just about $1200 a year now for over 4 years, for maintenance, wear items and repairs."
4377,"February 26, 2014  7:45PM",stickguy,My TL even with all the miles has not averaged close to that. The 2 (out of 5) expensive years might have run up around that much. Of course I am holding my breath that nothing expensive (the tranny) bites the dust on me. That might junk an otherwise good car.
4378,"February 26, 2014  8:01PM",Mr_Shiftright,Here's something to make your blood run cold: http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323646604578403191117526644
4379,"February 26, 2014  8:04PM",m6user, might have run up around that much. Of course there are exceptions to every average. My recent Infiniti went 100k and 10yrs with total actual repairs of less than $500 not including wear and tear items. But IMO that was an exception as well. Can you count on it? Heck no especially with brands that tend to have a lot more expensive repairs after warranty like most German cars. They might not break often but when they do it is very expensive unless your brother-in-law can fix it.

4381,"February 20, 2014  2:14PM",andys120, All what? This whole renaming scheme has turned into a collosal mess but I guess it's fair to point out that BMW is hardly the only automaker that can't come up with consistent model names. Then there's Lincoln whose model names are too consistent (everything is an MK-Something.)

4383,"February 20, 2014  3:04PM",Michaell,"Isn't there going to be a 4-series ""grand coupe"" as well, like the 6-series? Isn't that just a fancy name for a sedan? I think the marketing folks at BMW are splitting hairs."
4384,"February 20, 2014  3:13PM",kyfdx," l That's BMW's international website, not the BMWUSA website. (even though it's in English) That doesn't mean it won't happen here, but there you go..."
4385,"February 20, 2014  3:16PM",robr2,Yes there will be a 4 series Gran Coupe. The difference is that the Gran Coupes have a lower roof line than traditional sedans.
4386,"February 20, 2014  4:08PM",dino001," Yes and I'm quite excited about it. It will have a rear hatch, just like GT, but it will be lower to the ground, i.e. much more sporty in driving experience. Unlike 3-series wagon, it will be available as 335 and my understanding is RWD, not just AWD, as both GT and wagon. On paper and pictures, 435i Sports Line (red exterior, black w/red stiching interior, red accents, high gloss inlays), may really be my next car. Will see how it will really look and feel when it comes."
4387,"February 20, 2014  4:14PM",robr2,"I wonder if all the models that BMW is/will be offering will start to confuse potential customers? I guess that's why the are dumping salespeople and hiring ""geniuses""?"
4388,"February 20, 2014  4:32PM",Mr_Shiftright,Being a tech genius is not the same as being a salesman. Many of us have experienced smart people who were lousy teachers.
4389,"February 20, 2014  5:10PM",robr2,"BMW doesn't want salespeople. They want geniuses who can explain the tech in BMW's in a clean, low pressure, stark environment - like Apple stores - to people who are used to shopping on-line."
4390,"February 20, 2014  5:44PM",Mr_Shiftright,"But put yourself in the place of the dealership owner, with his massive investment. Apple stores are factory stores, not franchises. I'm not sure $500--$2000 products scale up to $50,000 products."
4391,"February 20, 2014  6:00PM",stickguy,"You need both. Someone to part the suckers with 50-100K, and someone that can actually teach them to use it. Age of specialization. Even the Jetta my son got took a good half hour for the sales guy to walk through the basics of how stuff worked. And we know most people would never dream of cracking open the owners Manual."
4392,"February 20, 2014  6:21PM",robr2," ...and dealership owners know that the brand requires regular updates to the showroom both inside and out.

4393,"February 20, 2014  7:28PM",kyfdx,"My local BMW dealer already employs a ""delivery specialist"", that isn't a salesperson. They go over the car with the new buyer, pair the cell phones with the bluetooth, etc, etc... The salesperson shows them to the car, introduces the delivery specialist, then checks back when they are ready to go.."
4394,"February 20, 2014  7:43PM",Mr_Shiftright,"That's a smart move, and eliminates early ""come-backs"" out of confusion."
4395,"February 20, 2014  7:53PM",flightnurse," Yes the dealership I go to has 3 of these people on all the time. It could take up to an hour to show people all th e features and how to use them.... Smart move for BMW, but a little over due."

He didn't know how to use most of the features. Thing is, I just had an issue this weekend in the T&C that would never have been resolved in Intro 101. I got a flat tire. There is no way in hell I would have ever been able to find and remove the spare tire from under the car if it weren't for the owner's manual (which was thankfully in the car). Even after removing the center console and lowering the spare to the ground using the special tool, I still didn't know how to get the damned cable off the spare, and even the owner's manual left that part out. Eventually got the job done, but not without alot of frustration."

4399,"February 20, 2014  9:49PM",dino001," It already is here, last six months. I think, once GC is here and you look at them side by side, you'll see difference that is large enough to understand there is a real choice. GT is a peoplemover, large legroom, softer suspension, standard AWD, etc. - it was made for all those who want sporty BRAND, but [non-permissible content removed] about the rear seat, or ""horrible hard suspension"" in a sporty CAR. GC is more driver's car with SOME room for other people and improved cargo space, available as RWD. It is for people who know exactly what a ""sporty coupe"" really means (I said ""sporty"", not ""sports""), but just want incremental (read limited) improvement in people and cargo moving abilities vs. traditional coupe. Think 5-series GT vs 6-series GC. Those are quite a bit different vehicles for different customers."

4401,"February 20, 2014 10:46PM",andys120," Maybe BMW is tired of looking like all the brands that have copied ""The Kink""."
4402,"February 21, 2014  3:42AM",nyccarguy,"@kyfdx When the previous generation 7 series was introduced in 2002, I actually interviewed for a position at the BMW dealer in Manattan to become an ""iDrive Delivery Specialist."" I didn't get the job because I questioned the way I'd be paid. It was to be a $200 per week base and then I'd get paid more based on a CSI score. I asked how my pay would be affected if someone's iDrive crashed before try got their survey. That was a chance I couldn't take living in Manhattan trying to support myself. @qbrozen My Dad had an '07 X5 which was the 1st car BMW introduced with the ""beer tap shifter."" One morning in a snow storm, he drove over a 2 x 4 (that he couldn't see). The ""low coolant"" light went on, so he pulled over, shut the truck off, and looked to see if there was any coolant spewing out from underneath it. He lifted the hood and everything looked OK. He fired the X5 back up and was about to head to the dealer, when he looked down at the dash and the low coolant light wasn't on anymore. So he continued on his way to work. Now I have to tell you that my Dad travels back and forth to work with his 2 Great Danes. He keeps a piece of plywood over the folded rear seats to keep his truck cleaner. Anyway, its snowing, it's 6:30 AM, and my Dad's X5 literally shuts off in the middle of the Tappan Zee Bridge. I'm cleaning off my Prelude getting ready to go to work and I see he keeps calling me. Maybe he plans to tell me about an accident on the way (we work together)? I listen to the voice mail, he says: ""call me, I'm stuck on the bridge."" I call him back and he tells me the story, then asks: ""how do I get this thing into neutral so the thruway authority can load it on the flatbed?"" He checks the owner's manual. Without the owner's manual we sold have never figured out: Remove the cup holder, remove the piece under the cup holder, remove red ""T"" key from the spare tire compartment. Stick the red ""T"" key into the square hole underneath the cup holders and twist to release the transmission so vehicle can be loaded on to flatbed. Just a few problems, he had to get out of the car in the snow on a bridge (cars flying by on the driver's side & the Hudson River on the passenger side). Open the rear lift gate to get to the ""T"" key where the spare tire is seems easy enough, except it was under a piece of plywood perfectly cut to fit the rear of the X5. The tow truck drivers from the NYS Thruway Authority can't help him because every time they try to help my Dad pick up the plywood, his 140 lb Great Danes start barking and scare the pants off the poor guys."
4403,"February 22, 2014  5:58AM",roadburner,"@nyccarguy: Another reason to despise the beer tap. To me it feels flimsy and is non-intuitive. It is a classic example of BMW hell-bent on fixing something that wasn't broken- ""Ja, ve vill be different because ve can, you stupid Amerikaners..."""
4404,"February 22, 2014  1:45PM",graphicguy," You'll get no argumet about that from me. Counterintuitive is being kind regarding their shifter. Eventually, many years later, they usually get it right (i.e. iDrive). But, it takes years of customers telling them they got it wrong to begin with for them to correct their mistakes."
4405,"February 22, 2014  7:01PM",flightnurse,"I find the comments about the new shifter interesting. I don't have a problem with it, yeah, at first it was odd, but now, I have no problems. Like anything else humans do not like change, but once we get use to the change, we are fine..."
4406,"February 22, 2014  7:19PM",roadburner,"Change doesn't bother me- it is change for the sake of change that I find irritating. Sure, you can adjust to to the beer tap, but in what way is it an improvement over the shift lever it replaced? It's merely another example of Munich's focus on bells and whistles. Meanwhile, the driving experience that built BMW's modern legacy continues to devolve into mediocrity."
4407,"February 23, 2014  3:36AM",dino001,"Beer tap shifter allowed them to release some space in center console for storage and decent cupholder. Regular shifter has larger range of movement and blocks more space. That's the story I heard from a salesman, anyway."
4408,"February 23, 2014 11:34AM",andys120, Next thing you know they'll move the shifter to the steering column-50s style. Mercedes has already done this and they practically invented the console shift for autoboxes. Just shoot me now.

4413,"February 19, 2014  5:02AM",roadburner,"@nyccarguy: The car was throwing a CEL every so often. No driveability issues. There's a TSB for the issue and it calls for an oil change so I got that for ""free."" While it was in the CBS said the car also needed new plugs(plugs used to be a 100K service item- oh well...) AND-as recent slow cranking suggested-the battery was shot. With the IBS you are pretty much locked in to a BMW battery so I bit the bullet and had the dealer do it. At least I should be good for at least another five years/57K on both the new plugs and battery. Driving away the DCT fault light came on. Turns out the steering angle sensor didn't initialize after the battery swap. Ten minutes later my tech beat it into submission and we had no issues after that. If you haven't guessed, this incident-along with BMW's rush to convert most every vehicle in their lineup into a soulless Germanic Lexus-is what has caused me to seriously consider finding another 1988 M6 to share the garage with the Club Sport. Grab a used Abarth/GTI/MCS JCW for a commuter sled/winter beater and I'm all set."
4414,"February 19, 2014  5:07AM",roadburner," I treat the FWD BMW like many Porsche True Believers treat the Cayenne and Panamera.

4415,"February 19, 2014  7:40AM",andys120,"Roadburner you're exactly right, this isn't the BMW for lovers of RWD but we have plenty of terrific cars available to us that do feature RWD. We also need to understand that BMW is a wsorldwide maker/seller of cars that happens to be based in Europe. In the European market 5-door ""family sized"" hatches are as common as pickups are in North America. The Active Tourer will be sold in the USA and I'd bet most will be AWD versions, in fact I might consider one of those. There's also a lot of moaning among the hard core Propellerheads that BMW shouldn't be making a ""minivan"" but with a 105"" wheelbase the Active Tourer is considerably shorter than the smallest Minivan on the US market, the Mazda 5 (@108""). In fact it has a shorter wb than my E46 Cabrio (107""). By US standards this is a subcompact hatchback."

The EPA rated my car at 36 on the highway... The picture is the new Active Tourer and it sells very well in other markets, over on Bimmerfest, like any other BMW forum there are two camps, one that love it and other is they hate it.

4440,"January 29, 2014  8:21PM",robr2, Don't forgot the MSD's are on top of the capital cost reduction. They can't get the $300 a month deal without the $2995 and they couldn't afford the $410 or so monthly lease without the CCR.
4441,"January 29, 2014 10:32PM",markcincinnati,"I would NOT put any cap cost reduction money into this; I would, however, consider MSD's since you do get it back at the end of the lease -- cap cost reduction money is gone forever and even worse if the lease has no GAP coverage to account for the delta between value and owed (the gap between, so to speak) should the leased vehicle be totaled. If you can or want to put money down on the lease and it gets you where you want to be, I have no issue with it. However, if you've got that money, I would assume you also can justify lighting your cigars with paper money instead of matches (wooden, of course). Seriously, money to lower a lease payment is somewhat hard to justify these days. If $2,995 lowers the mo pay by $100 for 36 months, wouldn't it be acceptable to put the money in an account and know that at least you've got 30 of the next 36 payments (the $100 difference, that is) accounted for? Let's not assume we know how better to spend someone else's money. I've learned a lot from Edmunds and Audi World, etc; I used to think putting something toward the lease was at least OK. Now I think differently -- but that is certainly in part due to the participation of many folks here. I found my stupidity is incurable, I found my ignorance could be cured, however. DILYL"
4442,"January 30, 2014  2:29AM",nyccarguy,"@robr2 Right again! @flightnurse @markincincinnati brought up a great point about GAP insurance. It's automatically written into every auto leasing and financing contract in New York State. So there's another ""if"" that could have potentially cost me more money by leasing from a dealer here in Connecticut. Depending on the dealer, they charge $400 - $700 for this optional protection. So between the high doc fee, the GAP insurance, the possibility of being offered significantly less on the trade, and even a little more on the price of the car, maybe it would be a wash."
4443,"January 30, 2014  2:33AM",nyccarguy,"@markincincinnati When I leased my BMW, the financing rate at 0.9% was significantly cheaper than the money factor I'm paying to lease (somewhere in the 4% range). Where I believe I'll come out ahead is in the end. According to my car's leasing contract, it will be worth around in the $28K range. According to ""the auctions,"" my car with 50K miles will be worth much less."
4444,"January 30, 2014  2:43AM",stickguy,"@Bradd, I know I wouldn't pay 28K at the dealer for your car with 50K on it. And that would be a refreshed CPO. So certainly wouldn't be buying it out (as it sits) for that much!"

4447,"January 30, 2014  5:13AM",flightnurse," The price shoppers will plunk down 3K to get that 50K car for 410/m but the people who really understand how it all works wouldn't do that. Lately BMW has been offering some ""incentive cash."" $750 for having BMSCCA account, $500 for being a USAA member, and currently BMW has $750 back on all 3 series. So right there you are talking $2250, this will cover fee's and first month payment, and a slight cap reduction (remember all this is ZERO out of pocket.) then add 7 MSDs, so basically you could just walk into the dealer, with $3500 and walk out with a payment of $540/m on that 50K car, and at the end of your lease get that $3500 back. Those 7 MSD's well save you roughly $50/m x 36 = $1800. So you could walk into and have a cap reduction that doesn't cost you a cent but helps to lower the payments slightly. When I did my deal on my 320, I was very temped to lease since BMW was giving me 2K built credit and 1K for my grad degree, a total of 3K, plus add $2400 for 7 MSDs, my payments would have been $280/m."

It was so hard to look at the car without laughing. The paint jobs on the cars were horrible, orange peel all over the car, the fit and finish was really bad, the gaps in body panels were worse then the late 60's and early 70's GM cars. The designs were blatantly stolen from other car manufactures. One car company had a rip off MB SLK, It was scary to see..."

However, we won’t have to wait too long to see the car revealed, according to the latest reports. Just-Auto, based on an interview with Jaguar design boss Ian Callum, is reporting that the new car, rumored to be called the XS, will be revealed as early as this summer. This suggests that we could see it, or at least a concept version, unveiled at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in late June, the Brit event where last year Jaguar presented its Project 7 concept car. During the same interview, Callum is also reported to have said that Jaguar is planning facelifts for several models, including the recently launched F-Type range. Though he didn’t confirm plans for any other models, we know due to test mule sightings that Jaguar is also working on a new crossover as well as a next-generation XF. As for the XS, it is based on the aforementioned iQ[Al] structure, a lightweight aluminum design that will incorporate a new family of four-cylinder engines called the Hotfire series. Jaguar has also designed its iQ[Al] structure to be able to accommodate its 3.0-liter V-6 already offered in the F-Type range."

4464,"February 14, 2014  7:30PM",markcincinnati,"My second new S4 came in late last month -- and I'm loving it! OK, OK, not literally another actual car, rather the Audi break-in part one (~5,000 miles) and a check up and oil change at the dealer. This 2014 Audi S4 is like every other Audi I've had since 1977 -- you end up getting a new car (on the day you pick it up) and then you get another ""new car"" at 5,000 and around 10,000 miles as the engine seems to really get stronger and stronger. We've had the worst winter here in SW Ohio in what seems like decades (some local weather types have said this has been one of our worst in over 20 years) and I felt no need to swap tires. The all-seasons that the car came with had zero problems. My wife's SQ5 (purchased about 6 weeks or so after my S4) has 20"" Continental Extreme DWS all seasons (UHP too) and she's has no traction issues either. I watch the man screaming QUATTRO!!!! on the commercial told from the POV of a tow-truck driver and we are living proof of the prowess of the quattro AWD system. Sweendogy, I suspect there isn't too much different between your 2013 S4 and my '14, other than the fact that you were able to pay less -- I hope your car is under warranty and is CPO'd, which should at least provide you with the peace of mind (financially) you want. I'll bet any repairs on an S4 out of warranty will be breathtakingly expensive (shudder.) I finally saw my first SQ5 (other than my wife's) a couple of days ago -- and, finally, finally, saw my first Q50 at long last. Boy, the sales on that one must be slow; I've seen several Lexus IS's though, making me think that one has been a heckuva lot more successful in the market. The new TLX (show car) actually seems pretty attractive -- although I don't really miss my '12 TL, I don't have any real complaints about it now that it's gone -- the S4 is a totally different experience, but, to my dying day, I do think Acura's TL SH-AWD was their version of an S4 (for a lot less $). I sat in an S6 at the dealer recently -- now that may be my new Batmobile -- but, hey, for $80,000+ it ought to be. Anyone have the sales figures for 2013 and so far in 2014 for our list of ELLPS cars? I'd love to see how the IS, Q50, TL, A4/S4, etc did and are selling. Drive it like you live."
4465,"February 15, 2014  4:10PM",sweendogy,"Mark - from my understanding the 14 s4 came with standard smart key access and maybe on other item items - on reliability I know audi has gotten way better, but as of right now I have plenty of warrantee ahead."
4466,"February 18, 2014  3:56PM",markcincinnati,"The ONLY Audi I had that really, truly SCARED me, with respect to reliability, durability and co$t to keep post-warranty, was my 1997 A8. The thing, in warranty thankfully, kept having failure after failure of ""little and medium"" components. I didn't have engine or transmission problems, but I suspect things like the motors (and it had a bunch of them) that controlled the seats, seat belt height and on and on, just kept failing (and being replaced again and again.) My subsequent Audi was a 2000 A6 4.2, which had brake rotor issues -- but nothing else other than routine mntce to speak of; same thing with my 2001 A6 4.2, brake rotors and everything else was solid. Since then, my 2003 allroad, 2005 A6 3.2, 2009 A4 2.0T and my current 2014 S4 all seemed to me (pretty early on the S4 though) to be reliable. My 2005 A6, which I kept to about 66,000 miles as I recall, also would make me say ""durable."" Yet, these days with several of the Japanese maker's cars easily going 150,000 miles with ""routine"" mntce, 66K miles hardly is proof positive. One of the people I work with has a 2005 BMW 5 series and he did buy the extended SERVICE package when he purchased the car new. This was NOT a warranty -- just an extended ""factory"" mntce policy. After 50K miles, these German cars often require wholesale replacement of ""stuff"" in the name of service (maintenance, i.e.) Audi, too, offers extended mntce (for a price) and there is some procedure you can go through to get your own car CPO'd (again, for a price) which takes the warranty to 100,000 miles (up to 6 years from first date of use). After 100K miles, however, you're on your own. Here is the thing my friend has found with his BMW -- with his extended service contract in hand, he was able to have a fully paid off car with no added service charges for about 2 years. Then, after the service contract died, he did have some on-going (fairly expensive) service or repairs (it is hard to know, sometimes what is ""broken"" and what is just ""time to replace""), but the cost of the repairs at MAX was $1,400 and typically was $100-$300 -- and didn't actually happen frequently. So, the cost of having a very well maintained, comfortable, good performing 2005 5 series was, at most, $2,000 in one year, typically half that. When I get in his 2005 BMW, I can tell it isn't as up to date (with respect to the electronics for instance) as a 2014 Audi S4, but overall it is still clearly a very nice performance/luxury car that when detailed looks in near showroom condition and is cheap to own. I'm looking forward to the latter -- even though I do love to keep up with all the new-tech. I'm driving my wife's 2014 SQ5 Prestige today -- wow, in some respects I like it better than my S4! Of course the S4 has the S-tronic transmission which has to be driven to be believed. DILYL"
4467,"February 18, 2014  9:52PM",andys120," I'd be afraid of any of those top-of the line Eurocars out of warranty too. The complex systems always turn up on the A8s, 7ers and S-Classes before they migrate to lesser models. Apparently by the time they go downscale they're pretty much de-bugged. I'm on my third out-of-warranty German car including a 5 Series that now has 150K on it and has only had one expensive failure (Vanos Control Module- $1200).

For some reason I like the X3 more than the 328i, which is atypical since my other favorites are my '02 and Club Sport..."
4470,"January 24, 2014  6:17PM",dino001," Volvo ED is nice, but the pricing is only attractive when there are no big cash incentives. However, Volvo frequently throws those in, sometimes thousands - which makes ED price is not so great, in comparison. Unlike BMW, Volvo's ED pricing is non-negotiable, like all others, it does not include incentives - however, you sometimes can get an extra discount (usually $500 or so) on certain prebuilt models waiting in Sweden. And you still get the ticket, one night at the hotel and the dinner, and you can have a free car rental for couple of weeks. It is worth something, if you plan to go anyway."

4474,"January 25, 2014  2:25PM",dino001," Honda has a ""special"" status in Europe. It's a brand that everybody recognizes and respects, but not many people buy. Pricing is the issue. Their product is too expensive there, plain and simple. Some of that has to do with tarriffs (for products that are not made in EU), some with market positioning. My dad used to have Japanese made Civic and it was a great vehicle. No perfect, but worked well. He sold it for a nice price when it was time to move on. But the customer base is simply too small for mass-market brand ambitions and price is the root."

4478,"January 27, 2014  7:27PM",markcincinnati,"I'd bet Acura wants to get the TLX to dealers very soon -- however, there will have to be a bit of a balancing act in that the current TL inventory will have to be taken into consideration, so that the new TLX doesn't force the 2014 TL to be discounted until it hurts. My Audi dealer says that based on current inventory, it is now typical for the new cars (without owners names attached already) to be held ""in port"" whilst the current inventory is worked down. I guess we should appreciate that approach (if we are already owners) since it would seem to help preserve, somewhat, the value of the current model. I remember when I could go into a dealership and there would be plenty of leftover ""last year models"" gathering dust until the deep discounting started them moving again. Don't see that so much anymore. I'm gonna ""forecast"" the TLX will fare better with the pro reviewers and enthusiasts' magazines than did the Q50 from Infiniti. Been wrong before. DILYL"

4487,"January 29, 2014  5:02PM",m6user,Did you mean 1.93%? If you know where one can earn 19.3% in a conservative investment.......please share. Is Bernie back at it???
4488,"January 29, 2014  5:25PM",robr2," I read that as well. Putting $4900 down as a security deposit reduced the monthly payment by $40 a month. Over 24 months, the return was over 19%. But I'm guessing those that can afford to tie up $5K for 2 years aren't stretching to buy a 328 for $300 a month."
4489,"January 29, 2014  5:43PM",Mr_Shiftright,Oh I don't know. There are some well to do people who are pretty tight with a buck. I have no idea how popular these MSDs are.
4490,"January 29, 2014  6:22PM",robr2,Good point - but I'll turn it around: I'm guessing that those who are stretching to lease a 328 for $300 a month don't have $5K to tie up for 2 years.
4491,"January 29, 2014  6:51PM",flightnurse," The really sad part is, BMW dealers don't talk about MSD's. I would assume those in the KNOW about them use them."
4492,"January 29, 2014  6:51PM",nyccarguy,"Thinking back about MSDs, I should have taken the equity from my Acura and paid as many MSDs as I could to both lower the payment and get the cash back at the end of the lease (September). Problem is that the dealer that I bought from (who gave me the best price for my 3er and my trade) is in NY, a state that does not allow the use of MSDs. Instead I used the equity plus my $500 BMWCCA rebate to pay up front fees (Acquisition, DMV...) plus my 1st 9 lease payments. If I would have bought the car where I live in CT, I could have paid MSDs up front. Who knows, they might not have given me as much for my trade and hit me with a $499 doc fee. Thinking about it now, that would have been a better use of the ""free money."" Now I know for next time:)"
4493,"January 29, 2014  6:54PM",nyccarguy,"@robr2 You are right, they might not have the $5K to lay out for MSDs, but they'll ""put down"" $2995 as a cap cost reduction not realizing that if their car gets stolen or totaled at any point during the lease they loose that money."
4494,"January 29, 2014  7:06PM",flightnurse,"@nyccarguy I was not aware that MSDs were not allowed in NY.. In retrospect a deal in CT with the MSDs could have gotten you lower payments, but the sale price could have been more. We live and learn. What are you going to do when you 328i is up ?"
4495,"January 29, 2014  7:09PM",m6user," Agree. Many, many people that could simply write a check for one of these cars if they wanted to are in that position by taking advantage of saving money when possible. There is a difference between being frugal and being cheap. I would do that deal if I was into leasing for that kind of return in a heartbeat. I've got a pretty good chunk in money market funds that return much less than 1%, so letting someone hang onto my money for two years for a 19% return would make all kinds of sense."
4496,"January 29, 2014  7:20PM",nyccarguy,"@flightnurse I do truly love the way my car drives. To put it simply, it is the car that I'll look to compare every other. It is the 1st, but don't think it will be the last E90 I own. I'm definitely not going to buy the lease out because the residual is too high and I'll have somewhere in the neighborhood of 50,000 miles on it when the lease is up at the end of September. I'm going to go for something less expensive for the time being. I'll lease something like an Accord or Subaru Impreza 5 door and share it with my wife for 15K per year (when she drives the new car, I'll drive her Pilot or my Prelude when the weather is nice). Once my BMW lease is up, I'll only have 18 months left to pay off the Pilot. I might be able to pay the Pilot off a little earlier too. 1 car payment would be nice."
4497,"January 29, 2014  7:52PM",kyfdx,"I've done MSDs twice... Once on a BMW and once on an Infiniti. Plenty of leasers are looking for the killer deal. Believe me, there is no way I'd be in the market for a $40K-$50K car, if I was buying it. (even if I could technically afford it). So, if I can knock a payment down from $430/mo. to $378/mo. using MSDs, you can bet that weighs heavily on whether to get that vehicle...."
4498,"January 29, 2014  7:53PM",kyfdx,"Not that I'd call it conservative... or even, likely repeatable... but, my portfolio was up 35% last year (as were most of those heavily invested in equity index funds)."
4499,"January 29, 2014  8:19PM",markcincinnati,"Regarding the statements: "" BMW probably does the most to subsidize their leases. I think Mercedes does, too."" And: ""I wouldn't call it subsidizes they have programs..."" Well, the truth of the matter is that BMW [among others] does provide ""financial support"" for leases made through their financial companies. This support is often (usually) called a ""sub-vented lease."" Subventing makes leasing more attractive to the buyer who doesn't care so much about the MSRP of a given vehicle, but does care about the monthly payment. Either a purchase or a lease ""deal"" can be subvented -- but the real impact of subventing is going to be able to be much greater for a lease than a loan. The best thing that can be done regarding a loan to buy a new car is that the interest rate charged can be set to zero (0% apr). This way a $36,000 car can be purchased and the payments determined by dividing $36,000 by the number of months that payments will be made. $36,000 divided by 36 months, then, equals DOH! a $1,000 per month payment. I assume we could stretch the point and say that the manufacturer could offer a ""loyalty"" or ""conquest"" or even a ""just because"" bonus or rebate or discount of $1,000, making the amount financed be only $35,000, meaning the payment would be $35,000 divided by 36 months or $972.22/month. A subvented lease, on the other hand, is where the mfg can really influence your ""purchase"" decision. Here's why. When you lease a new car, the payment will be determined (generally speaking) by several things: 1.The % of value (residual value) that the car will have at the end of the lease 2.The money factor (think of it as the interest rate) that is used. Roughly speaking you can calculate the lease payment (remember the word ""roughly"") by subtracting the residual value from the MSRP of the car to get your anticipated usage cost. If the car is $36,000 and its residual is 50%, your usage over 36 months is $18,000. If you put money (out of your pocket) as what you might term a ""down payment"" you will reduce the amount of the ""agreement"" by that amount (this is called a capitalized cost reduction). This ""down payment"" [in your mind] does not reduce the residual value of the car, meaning that if you decided to buy the car at the end of the lease the amount you will have to come up with will still be $18,000. Please, don't call any money down on a conventional (closed-end) lease a down payment and I won't either. It is a ""cap cost reduction"" -- and the purpose of this cap cost reduction is solely to reduce the monthly payment. You are NOT building up any value, post lease, whatsoever. The money factor (or the implied cost of money -- or interest rate) is applied to recognize the value of the ""time"" you have the auto mfg's finance arm's money tied up. Far more detailed explanations -- and explanations that are specific to your lease deal -- are available here on Edmunds and of course at your dealership. The bottom line, however, is this: the auto manufacturer's financial outlet may offer a lease to you that has been subvented by the manufacturer. The subventing can take the form of: A reduction of the money factor -- including taking it to zero; or, An increase of the residual % -- including taking it to a very optimistic % (+5% or even more) -- meaning the car will be said to be worth a much larger percentage of its brand new value than market conditions would likely support. This manipulation of the residual cannot be done when the car is financed outright -- so perhaps you can see that a subvented lease could produce a very very low monthly payment if the mfg decides to reduce the money factor to zero or near zero and increases the residual value significantly over the expected depreciation. Subvented leases often carry with them terms that are not as ""friendly"" to you as a straight buy with a loan or a lease that has not been subvented. If the manufacturer says the residual is 62% after 36 months and the reality of the situation is that the 36 month value should only be 55%, you may not be able to get out of your lease early without a huge $ penalty (plus perhaps a standalone early termination fee or penalty). If you buy and finance a car, you can sell or trade you car almost at any time and only pay the potential difference between the outstanding loan amount and the amount you can sell the car for. It may feel like a prepayment penalty, but the reality is that there will be no literal prepayment penalty (it is uncommon for an auto loan from a bank, for instance, to have a prepayment penalty -- if you want to get out of the loan, you can sell the car and give the proceeds to the bank plus a bit more out of your pocket or perhaps a check from the bank.) So, leases give, leases take. Leases are sometimes of the very, very low payment variety -- meaning there is some subventing going on and suggesting that you'd better be prepared to not fall out of love with your new baby for ""about 90%"" of the lease's term. I say that because it is also common practice to put customers in 39 month leases and then around month 33 start to seduce ""owners"" into the showrooms with the promise of letting them out of their leases without penalties if they re-lease the new model. BMW does have a reputation -- I assume well founded -- for ""supporting"" (subventing) leases. This can make getting into a $50,000 Bimmer ""within reach."" It also pretty much locks customers into the cycle of ""lease, burn through the lease, and re-lease"" again and again. Nothing wrong with that for a lot of consumers. But not for all. If you want to keep your car 5 years or longer, you may not find leasing economics works for you; If you drive more than 18,000 miles per year (and probably the message could be ""more than 15,000 miles per year), you may not find leasing economics works for you (as your residual will likely drop sharply, meaning the monthly payment will rise sharply in response); If you own a business, on the other hand, leasing may mean you can ""expense your lease payment"" to the company (with proper and available proof), which many would consider to be a good thing; If you want to build equity in your car, well that is ""highly"" (or at least ""fairly"") unlikely in a leased car, but more likely in a car that you are making payments on to buy. And the pros of leasing AND buying go on. Neither my wife nor I had ever purchased a car, until late 2013 when we bought her '14 Audi SQ5 Prestige; we also lease a '14 Audi S4 (and are fully intending, 4 months into the lease, to buy the thing at the end of the lease -- and we put NO money down on the lease). This is a new experience for us and we keep rationalizing that -- at this time -- buying (for us) will likely turn out to be a better deal since we intend on keeping the cars more than 5 years. So, my point in all that is above is this: Auto manufacturers DO indeed provide financial subsidies (i.e., named subvented lease programs). Multiple security deposits are NOT, strictly speaking, subsidies, however. DILYL"

My 1995 318ti has one- as does my Mazdaspeed 3 and the latest GTI. I guess I should be happy that RFTs have been ditched in favor of Pilot Super Sports"
4505,"January 21, 2014  3:22PM",dino001," Why? I am a manual trasmission guy, my current and last three cars have had manual transmission, but diesel engine is probably LEAST fun and LEAST suitable with manual trasmission for a passenger car (it's a little different for towing vehicles and tractor trailers with 10-12 gear manuals used to crawl uphill or just maximize efficiency). This holiday I drove again (just like last year) my dad's Audi A4 with 1.9 TDI and manual transmission (it has sports suspension, too) and it was not a fun car, not to me anyway. The reason? Simple - diesel powerband is so narrow and short that I had to constantly shift up and down even on straight roads (just slight speed variation made it uncomfortable, if the car was on wrong gear). Ramp merging was a bit less scary than last year (as I got used to it and learned a little), but nevertheless couldn't hold a candle to a nice gasoline engine of similar power (even lower torque), when you can keep your car on same gear up to 5K+ rpm and keep accelerating. Diesel nicely kicks the speed up, but then equally suddenly dies in the middle of the manouver making you shift at least comfortable moment and lose time/distance. If there is one type of passenger car that I don't mind well spaced and timed multigear automatic (or CVT), it is exactly small diesel. I think people's wish to have MT diesel is simply misguided, based on what is not available and never tried. It almost feels like ""because these evil people don't offer it, it must be good""."
4506,"January 21, 2014  4:20PM",Mr_Shiftright,I'd agree with that...a turbo diesel is more compatible with a good automatic in a passenger car.
4507,"January 21, 2014  4:26PM",flightnurse," Exactly, the 8 spd in the BMW is one of the best in the business, and it suited for the diesel perfectly. What I have noticed, most of the 328d's on lots in Phoenix, have the sport package as well as M sport package, this give the transmission the Sport + feature. quicker shifting, holds gears longer, quicker throttle, add paddle shifting option and it's one of the best combo's."
4508,"January 21, 2014  4:27PM",flightnurse,"I guess I should have stated in my posting of the video that even though the M135 is a 135, it gives you an idea on what the M235i will be able to do."
4509,"January 21, 2014  6:53PM",nyccarguy,@dino001 I agree with you. I recently had a 328xd loaner car while mine was in for service (they finally fixed the trunk latch). The 8 speed automatic is perfectly matched to the Diesel turbo 4.
4510,"January 22, 2014  2:14AM",cdnpinhead," Well, I guess you told me. I've driven seven different diesels with manual transmissions (not counting my '71 KW with the RT910 Roadranger) in Europe between 2001 and 2013. I enjoyed each one and generally try to avoid complication in my vehicles. Manual transmissions rarely fail and cost significantly less to repair, plus which I can shift when and how I want, including skipping gears or changing my mind in the middle as traffic conditions change. That said, it's clear that BMW knows what it's doing, since there appears to be universal acceptance of what they're peddling."
4511,"January 22, 2014  4:16AM",flightnurse," Can't compare what happens in Europe with here, in Europe more cars are sold with manual transmissions than here in the states, have to sell what people want."
4512,"January 22, 2014  3:31PM",dino001," Well, I guess, our priorities are simply different. I'm sure it probably lies in one's definition of ""fun"" and what each of us considers a good experience. My point of reference for MT experience are good gasoline engines with long powerbands and decent torque (WRX, STI, 328), to which diesel simply cannot hold a candle in terms of driving satisfaction. I talked to many owners of diesels in Europe and ""fun"" is not even in their vocabulary. Their reasons of getting diesel is plain and simple - money. I consider current 328d a first BMW's legitimate entry in terms of economizing fuel efficiency, Such consideration was not as important in the past, but I guess times change, more and more marginal customers buy those things, so lowering their cost of ownership is one way of expanding the market opportunity. I think the 8AT is just right for it. I don't think 6MT would be any better in terms of driving experience and it would not provide any fuel economy savings. It might provide potential for better durability, but I didn't hear of massive failures of those BMW's autos. I may be misinformed, of course. The background of European popularity of diesel does not lie in its inherent ""fun"", or otherwise superior performance. It is a plain fuel economy advantage traded for clunky sound, higher noise, lower powerband. The diesel engines went long way from times when they were very slow and had unbearable vibrations. Today's turbos fixed that off-line acceleration problem - in fact the punch provided by diesel is better than gasoline - the only thing is it doesn't last. The maintenance seems to be more of an issue today, that's the price paid for better engine. The engines reportedly do not last as long as they used to, they are more sensitive to fuel quality, which can be a problem in certain areas and repair costs are massive. To be fair, that's true about all cars, not just diesels. In the world of $8-10/galon fuel (today's prices in Euro zone), every drop counts, so getting your car going further has real financial consequences, even for more affluent people. Only richest of the rich don't have to factor that in, the rest needs to consider if the great gasoline V6/I6, so popular with many Americans (not to mention V8), is affordable. Memo: it is not. Thus, the second and real only choice becomes a decent diesel. Prior recent boom, diesel fuel was also considered a lower grade byproduct and it was taxed less, creating a double bang for a buck (higher mpg on lower priced fuel). That advantage is gone now and one can already see the trend not as strong as it used to be."
4513,"January 22, 2014  3:40PM",markcincinnati,"Regarding Diesels & Transmissions post (above): I suppose there is some chance that the manual transmission ""option"" will soldier on, probably for several more years. However, the manual transmission is, sadly, on its death-bed. Sadly? Sure, sadly -- because manual transmission cars (or more accurately said ""some"" manual transmission equipped cars) generally speaking are more fun to drive; and, until recently manual transmission cars provided real, measurable benefits simply unavailable with even the best transmissions that shift(ed) themselves. Today, however, the manual transmission crowd, of which I consider myself to be a member, really doesn't have any attribute (that can be measured) that makes it ""better"" than some automatics. And, the thing is, even those automatics which are inferior -- today -- to a stick-shift, will likely soon be replaced with incrementally better autos until virtually all the automatic transmissions on the market are equal to or better than manuals. Then, as a natural progression, all automatics offered will render manuals measurably inferior -- leaving only ""fun-to-drive"" as their reasons for being. Of course, in the ELLPS and LPS world, at least, manuals will simply no longer be offered as the upcoming crop of drivers is both unfamiliar with manuals (read: unable to drive them) and really confused as to why anyone would even want to shift a car. We are progressively moving toward the autonomous automobile -- at least if you believe the story on CBS's Sunday Morning program where the new autonomous technologies were put on display courtesy of Mercedes (and Volvo and, and, and). Manual transmissions, like light beers, are dead and they just don't know it yet. I used to jump in a cab in Munich (often a light yellow Mercedes) and most of the time it was a manual transmission diesel version of the MB E Class. These days -- well since 2005 -- most of the cabs are as noted but with automatic transmissions. My assumption is, this can be seen as a bellwether -- either a predictor or cause-agent of things that will ""soon"" be adopted universally. My 1995 Audi S6 was ONLY available with a manual transmission; I can't even imagine a 2014 S6 so equipped -- and, frankly, despite my ""fun-to-drive"" comments, I can't even imagine I would want a 2014 S6 with a manual trans. How many of the ELLPS and LPS cars on the market are even offered with an ""optional"" manual transmission? Or perhaps the more pertinent question is what is the % of manual transmission versions of these ELLPS and LPS cars that are sold (at least in the US, anyway)? I would be pleasantly shocked to hear almost any number greater than 2%. The economics of offering an auto and a manual version are, likewise, already in play -- if a German manufacturer has to certify both a manual and an auto version of a model to be able to sell them in the US (and elsewhere, I'd imagine), my guess is they will simply decide there is no economic justification for certifying a model that represents but a tiny portion of sales, no matter what we say here, or no matter what the editors and writers of Car & Driver, et al, [non-permissible content removed] about. I'm so happy with my S4's 7-Speed S-Tronic (""automatic manual""), I really don't even miss the stick shift. I did, however, test drive the 2014 S4 with a manual, and I must say it sure was ""fun-to-drive"". I'm over it now, however. To the S-Tronic I say: ""You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din!” Drive it like you live."
4514,"January 22, 2014  4:33PM",dino001," I agree. I already made peace with my next car being most likely AT. I had a good run - three manuals in the row, ordered and driving probably last 328 wagon with MT they produced for US market (if not last, it is likely to be one of ten last). It should have some number etched into it. It will take a real enthusiast to take it off my hands at a good price when its time comes. More likely I will have to accept a lowball offer from a dealer."
4515,"January 23, 2014  4:18PM",graphicguy," Dino....like you and Mike, I've also made my peace over my past obsession with manual transmissions. I can't say as I could better the performance of these new(er) autmatic transmissions. Probably the only exception would be a manual trans in a muscle car or a Miata. That said, that market is so small in this country, and the demand is so weak, it is must a matter of time before the manual transmission goes the way of crank windows and non-airconditioned cars."

Pity that Volvo has become almost invisible and for some irrelevant; yet I always find these ED programs ""exciting"" and tell myself, ""Self, we should pick up our next car in Germany and drive it on the Autobahn"". But then it seems so easy to just rent a fill-in-the-blank for a few days, drive the rental on the Autobahn and not worry about parking YOUR new baby in a woefully small German, Italian or French or basement garage only to return to door dings. So, I end up renting or riding the train from Munich to Verona and enjoying the dining and drinking once you hit the Passo del Brennero (Brenner Pass, i.e.) and the Italian chef comes on board.

But the fact remains that Chinese-made Euro-branded cars are coming soon to the US. My question remains for everyone. BMW seems a favorite brand here; if the cars available at your dealer were Chinese-made, would you buy one?"

4566,"January 15, 2014 12:42AM",flightnurse," I wondered what happened to the forum, since I stopped getting message, I see a whole new look.. Since having my 320i now for 3 months, I can say that the smoothness is an issue, but since I have upgraded the ECU to the stage one, the extra power has really transformed the car. The harshness doesn't bother me at all, The 320 still have the feel of a BMW, the only positive that the Q50 has is the VQ engine, but that engine has it's issues too."
4567,"January 15, 2014 12:48AM",flightnurse," Price for the new M 3/4 has not been set, but the speculations are starting about 57K. The idea of the twin turbo 6 has to do with the CAFE numbers, but since the 320, 328i and 328d are all exceeding their EPA rating, we might see more fun cars from BMW... Like you graphic, the M235i has caught my eye, for under 50K you can get yourself a car that is really a M2 (full M suspension, and other go fast items) with the turbo 6 with the performance pack standard. And with the huge aftermarket for that turbo six the sky is really the limit. Rick really likes the 320i, so I might be able to talk him into using his car on a trade in for the M235i..."
4568,"January 15, 2014  3:49AM",nyccarguy,"@flightnurse Glad you (and presumably Rick too) are happy with your 320i. My car is in for service and I got a brand spankin new 2014 328xd. This is the 3rd new body style 3 series I've driven. BMW seems to be trying (operative word here) to inject some of its ""ultimate driving machine"" magic more and more. I actually like the new 3er more and more as a commuter. While the steering is still too vague for my tastes, the ride is comfortable & taut, the 8 speed automatic is well matched to both the 4cyl gasser & 4cyl diesel. The diesel is a bit harsher than the 4cyl gas 320i & 328i. As expected, mid range torque is fantastic, but the most impressive thing of all is the diesel's fuel economy. A green engine (the car had 9 miles on it when I picked it up) is showing between 39 & 40 mpg average. Literally almost double what I get with my 2011 328xi."
4569,"January 15, 2014  4:04AM",flightnurse," Over on Bimmerfest people are posting 50 mpg (highway) on trips with a relatively ""green"" engine. and as the engine loosens up more the mpg will increase too. For a commuter car the 328d is really one of best cars to get, it is comfortable, can carry 4 adults without problems, and get the same and or better MPG then so called economy cars. People are posting some incredible lease deal they are getting on them too. A base 328d, with heated seats and moonroof, MSRP 41K, sale price 37K, Minus $750 built credit, $1000 USAA credit, $1000 BMWCC credit, and the killer part they are added 7 MSDs (Multi Security Deposits) out of pocket was $3750 36m/12K/yr payment are $365/m + tax.

4570,"January 15, 2014  3:38PM",markcincinnati,"The new Acura TLX (and the press release comments) give me hope for the brand. I am going to assume the engineers and designers at Acura have banished as much of the ""Honda Effect"" as possible. I see no harm in some power train sharing, for example, but Acura needs to be a brand that stands out as a Brand, not just an upscale Honda. For years (and I know since I owned examples of both brands), it was quite easy to see the resemblance and lineage of Audi and VW. I assume it was Audi who made the decision to ""go their own way"" not the other way around. The result has been beneficial to both brands. The new Q50 (recently reviewed -- and not all that favorably -- on MotorWeek) got the style right as far as I am concerned. The 3.7L engine has been made to feel much smoother and the interior is more upscale befitting Infiniti's aspirations. Thus far, however, the reviews of the Q50 have been, well, underwhelming. I suspect the driving dynamics that the experts loved in the G37 will need to return and be improved upon sooner rather than later. The IS from Lexus -- in IS 350 F Sport trim -- seems to have gotten everything right, not so much however the lesser IS's, especially the 250 which has recently been given mostly ""thumb's down."" Now, along comes Acura with what appears to be a sparkling, spanky new TL(X). Acura, for the past few years, has been apparently wandering aimlessly (with the exception of the MDX, one of Acura's 'reasons for being') -- are they a Premium car-line or are they drifting further away with each passing year (a halo car, which is looking good, ain't enough to redeem them, yet). This new TLX is, from the web pictures a looker -- and the marketing message is pretty darn strong. Like the Q50 and the IS 350 F Sport, however, the proof will be when the automotive press gets their hands on the thing in several states of trim. Despite my ""one and done"" Acura TL SH-AWD flirtation and my subsequent return to Audi (with an S4 none the less), I did think the Acura was a decent attempt at creating an ELLPS; I still think the 2012 and newer Acura TL SH-AWD models were Acura's S4, and a high value vehicle, too. So, here's hoping Acura's glintzy (a made up word) new TLX lives up to our expectations as well as its press release. As Van Morrison said (adapted here to mean ""These are the days to be in the market for a new ELLPS""): ""These are the days, the time is now There is no past, there's only future There's only here, there's only now."" Get 'em while they're hot. And, drive it like you live."

The talk is all right on track for me too: performance, quiet cabin, tech. It's still got plenty of hurdles to clear though. I'm picky with interiors. I love Audi in that regard. I certainly prefer Honda/Acura to Toyota/Lexus interiors, but we will see what we get here. On top of that they will be contending with the upcoming A3 sedan and the CLA. I'm glad to see this new class being competitive!"
4575,"January 15, 2014  8:21PM",stickguy,"that spy shot of the TLX did look sharp. Not worried about the interior. They seem to have been doing a good job there. I am curious to see what they do for powertrain. Since it is replacing the TL and TSX, will they go with a 4/6/hybrid? Turbo something? Will also be nice if it frees up the ILX for a power boost. Basically use the 2.4l on a mid-level AT model, not just the ""hot rod'. That IMO will make it a much more desirable option since it will be plenty quick. Keep the 2.0l for the base car, and have the 2.4 as the upgrade."
4576,"January 15, 2014  8:47PM",markcincinnati,"The SH-AWD version will have the 3.5L V6 and a 9-speed dual clutch transmission, at least I think it said dual clutch (the 9-speed I am sure of). My 2012 TL had a 3.7L V6 rated at 305 HP -- which, these days is close to being too little (unless there is a big torque number that comes on at relatively low RPM's). I would assume Acura has goosed things appropriately all the way around. With respect to the interior -- well, most folks did not and do not seem to make favorable comments about the ""button-happy"" interior and steering wheel. Once I got used to things, it never really bothered me, but the 2012 interior was not what I would call ""premium"" -- it seemed like, well, TOO MUCH Honda Accord DNA had seeped into it. Looking at the Audi interiors often spoils [most] people for others interior treatments. I count myself as one of those so spoiled. I am, however, confident, that Acura will probably get the interior right this time. But wait -- it is probably going to be very much like the RLX, which has been recently criticized for still being too busy."
4577,"January 15, 2014  9:34PM",robr2, New 2.4 at about 200 HP with an 8 speed dual clutch auto with a torque converter and a 9 speed auto. SH-AWD and 4 wheel steering available on the 6.
4578,"January 15, 2014  9:52PM",graphicguy," I believe Acura was pretty early to the 300+ HP V6 party. I know my Mustang GT SOHC V8 had 300 HP less than 10 years ago. BMW is still touting their twin scroll turbo 6 as 300 HP (albeit I suspect that's under rated). The Lexus (x)S 350 V6 is right at that mark, too. The Infiniti V6 in the Q/G sedans have more HP, but are down on torque compared to the Acura V6. Audi uses a S/C on their 6 cyl, and is a great performer. Their 4 cyl is 220HP but is torquey. So, I think Acura is dead on if they end up with a 210-230 HP 4 cyl and a 310-320 HP V6. Again, 8 sp DCT or 9 sp transmissions put them right at the front of the class, too. Mark, I don't think Acura gives up anything to the Audi's interior in materials, build, or functionality. Like you, I've owned both. Still say the ELS sound system in the current TL trumps the B&O system in the S4. I'm into my new TL for at least 2-3 more years. After that, I'll be in my Acura store first visit of any shopping trip."

World-class engine and powertrain technologies, along with intelligent lightweight vehicle construction through extensive use of exotic construction materials, add to the intensity of the M feeling and driving experience. The extensive weight-reduction efforts of the BMW M engineers should not be under looked. The new BMW M3 and BMW M4 are the first BMW M cars to see a reduction in curb weight from one generation to the next. Both models are equipped with an all-new 3.0-liter inline-6 engine with M TwinPower Turbo technology and increased performance levels that distinguish them from previous generations of the M3 family, delivering 425 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque. Both the M3 Sedan and M4 Coupe accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in 3.9 seconds when equipped with the optional M-DCT transmission. By setting new segment standards in terms of dynamics, agility, precise handling and emotional design, the new BMW M3 Sedan and BMW M4 Coupe have set the benchmark for the high-performance segment created by the M3 many years ago.

At $55,000 (net), you can easily get into a well-optioned 2014 Audi S4 Premium Plus. Clearly I don't know what would impress you -- and if this Audi doesn't do it for you, you can load up a IS 350 F-Sport and at full MSRP be @ less than $51,000. Of course of the two noted above, the S4 is the real performer with its sweet supercharged V6. The torque steer is something to overcome in the Volvo S60 T6 (Type R) but it is tough to get this car OVER $50,000. It may not do it for you due to the obvious FWD bias, but it is worth a test-drive if you're in the market at this dollar amount. So, while $55K won't get us into the SUPERCAR realm, we do have a number of choices that will stay under this price cap. It's a great time to be in the market (the $50K+ market) if you ax' me.

4595,"December 19, 2013  4:58PM",graphicguy,"Mark...I replied privately, at least that's what I thought with the new Forums now in place. Don't get me wrong, I think the S4 is one of the best 4 door sports sedans on the market, regardless of price. But, mine has been very trouble prone (it's sitting at the dealership yet again right now). The Chicago Regional Rep, took over communications from the dealer I purchased it from. And, he's supposed to be in communication with the local dealer. I think the local dealer is just as frustrated with the local Audi Regional Rep as I am. We're well over the ""30 day"" rule of the car being out of commission. So, I think they're all huddling, trying to decide the next step to take. I'll wait to see what they do. So far, everyone except the local Audi Regional Rep have been great to work with. I ""think"" I know which diretion this will end up, but you never know. That said, if they do end up ""lemon"" lawing my car, I'll obviously be in a scramble to get something else. What that is, I really don't know. Ray...I do like that 235i M.

4596,"December 23, 2013  8:45PM",markcincinnati,"I have, in this forum, shared my experiences with my 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance. I did suggest that I understood and largely agreed with the July '10 Automobile comparison of a TL (SH-AWD) with an Audi S4 (with the sport differential – Audi's torque vectoring rear diff). Refresher (from Automobile, July 2010): “You probably never thought of the Acura TL SH-AWD and the Audi S4 on the same day, much less in the same sentence. . . .significantly, they both use torque-vectoring all-wheel-drive systems to ensure that they don't sacrifice one iota of the corner-carving thrills you've grown to love.” “In a [non-permissible content removed]-for-tat comparison between two cars that share the same driveline philosophy, it quickly becomes obvious that the Acura and the Audi are significantly different only in the details.” Now, with 3,000+ miles on my '14 S4 and after 40,000+ miles with my TL, I can offer my 2¢ more. First, let’s get the “as owned “ MSRP’s out there. With rear parking sensors, upgraded tires (UHP a/s's) and splash guards, the TL SH-AWD Advance comes in a bit south of $48,000. Approximately comparably equipped (but sans the sport differential) the S4 Premium+ easily sweeps past $57,000, coming in at $57,650 (without Premium paint, which could have added additional $, had I selected one of the many optional colors offered.) My '12 Acura came with the color called Bellanova White Pearl while the Audi I configured was in a glossy hue they call Ibis White. A metallic white option on the Audi would have added another $550 to the MSRP. If you’re keeping score, the Audi starts out about $10,000 more than the Acura similarly contented. But simply saying they have similar content somehow makes the Audi seem expensive, a perspective I have come to believe is untrue. As the Automobile review declares, “[they] are significantly different only in the details.” Never a truer statement was said about these two cars. And, please, don’t for a minute think that somehow this is a knock on the Acura. Indeed, considering its performance & content, the TL SH-AWD Advance_ is_ rather a bargain (and I mean what I say only about the SH-AWD Advance version – what I say should not suggest I would make these remarks about other TL configurations). Perhaps were I given the opportunity to test a TL with both SH-AWD and the manual transmission, I would change my opinion. The Audi is neither over-priced nor is it a bargain – but, considering its price, it is unlikely you will find the S4’s luxury content and performance envelope replicated without spending thousands more. The current heart-throb car, the Lexus IS 350 F-Sport, offers a very high contented, audaciously styled machine to be sure, but its performance isn’t up to the S4’s; in fairness, however, an F-Sport even over loaded with optional stuff, will have trouble breaking the $50,000 MSRP barrier. There is, currently, no BMW 3-series M car (if you don’t include the 3-series” M” convertible, starting at $69,050, which I am not counting) – and if there were, it too would easily sail through a $65,000 price; besides, the comparison to the S4 would be incorrect, the BMW M would be more accurately compared to an RS – not S – Audi car. Back to the TL vs the S4. Both cars do what they do well – at their respective price points. The Acura – subjectively – may well represent/possess over 90% of the Audi’s performance. And, for the money asked, the Acura remains perhaps one of the biggest bargains today in the ELLPS category (assuming you can get over the exterior – and for some, the interior – styling). Here is what you get for your extra $10,000+ in the Audi S4: a palpable sense that anything and everything you want the car to do is effortless. From the S-Tronic’s apparent ability to read the driver’s mind, to an incredibly deep bucketful of power that is always ready a ¼ of a second before you ask for it, to an ability to corner that approaches violating the laws of physics, the S4 almost becomes an extension of the driver’s mind, rather like Green Lantern’s power-ring, I suspect. In contrast, the TL SH-AWD is not quite as much the natural athlete as the S4 – although it has nothing to be ashamed of, it’s just that to get 90% of the S4’s performance out of the TL, you have to work at it. Here’s one reason why: the TL’s well of torque isn’t as deep as the Audi’s and the TL’s torque doesn’t reach full-boil until significantly higher RPM’s (the TL's V6 is naturally aspirated vs the S4's supercharged V6). The consequences of less torque attained at higher RPM’s twisting through 6 (automatic) gears are not subtle – the Acura must be kept “cranked up” to get the most out of it. While doing this can be pretty rewarding, it is hardly effortless. Another huge disadvantage the TL has is its 6 speed traditional (it uses a torque converter) automatic transmission. The Audi’s 7-speed direct shift (twin-clutch) transmission by comparison feels as if the smoothest stick shift driver ever is selecting the perfect time for upshifts and downshifts. Coming to a stop, the Audi’s transmission downshifts both at the appropriate time but also with incredible precision and smoothness that I doubt any one of us contributors here could even come close to. In the final analysis, the 2012 TL SH-AWD Advance is a lot of car for the money – and I would still call it Acura’s S4. For $47,000+ there isn’t much – if anything – that comes close to the content and performance offered (if you can get past its unique styling and busy button-laden cockpit.) I had mine 40,000+ miles over less than a 30 month time period and other than what I assumed were weak brakes (the rotors were turned twice before 25K miles before the dealer determined the problem was three warped wheels which Acura replaced – at a 50% discount to me), the Acura would certainly seem to be well on its way to living up to its reputation for reliability – but at only 40,000 miles I assume most cars on the market today would still seem young. The 2014 S4 presumably produces performance numbers that bests the TL in almost every category, but for an additional $10,000 it ought to. The S4 does seem more substantive than the TL – of course you only really notice this aspect when you slam the doors or hit a pot-hole or find yourself on a “washboard” road surface. The Acura’s body seems to be of a thinner metal than the Audi, the TL's suspension upon rapid compression or over undulating surfaces seems on the verge of being brittle where the Audi, under similar circumstances, seems to absorb and rebound from rough surfaces with aplomb. If you’re looking for the TL to buy you much – if any – street cred from your buds, don’t count on it. Virtually everyone I know called my TL, “Mark’s Honda.” Truth be told, the main problem with the Acura – for me – was that it simply had “too much Honda” in it. Some years ago, Audis were sometimes said to have “too much VW” in them – regardless of the truth, the perception was sufficient, apparently, to motivate Audi to separate themselves as much as they could from VW. Thus far, Acura’s are often thought of as “Honda’s who know somebody.” More’s the pity, for the TL (at least) is a kind of “almost” car – it is almost many things: almost a luxury car, almost a sporty car – i.e., almost an LPS car. I can recommend the TL SH-AWD Advance for its likely street price (I got mine at nearly 13% off); the car is comfortable, well contented and highly competent at most, if not all, of the things we ask for in a premium vehicle. It didn’t inspire much passion and, frankly, didn’t seem to actually have been built to be passionate. The S4 inspires and it has passion – its “fun to drive factor,” which seems to be priced at about $10,000, has been abundantly imbued by its creators. Even after a crappy day, driving the S4 puts a smile on my face. That’s my story . . . and . . you know. DILYL"
4597,"December 26, 2013 10:01PM",hercules00,"Infiniti has done many, many things to destroy its bread and butter - the awesome G37 - with the new Q50. The list of things is endless, from destroying what was likely the best handling vehicle in its class to a ridiculous dual touchscreen interior. For the sake of argument, let us say there was some logic behind those moves - some new audience that legacy G drivers like me (and almost all reviewers) do not understand. But can anyone explain why Infiniti felt the need to dump the G's trademark double-circular taillight arrangement to replicate the taillights of the Sonata? Was it their way of going 'upscale'? Sonata Q50"
4598,"December 27, 2013 12:45AM",carnaught,"I don't know. I don't see it that way. To me the Q50 looks more updated and upscale. The G, although handsome, was getting old."
4599,"December 27, 2013  6:18PM",markcincinnati,"I agree with the comments about the beauty of the new Q50. I think it is very handsome on the outside and both inside and out it seems more upscale befitting its inclusion with its competition from Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Lexus & Mercedes to name a few. The issues with the Q50 seem NOT to be with its comeliness, rather with its steering feel or lack thereof. Other critiques seem to remind the reader that the 3.7L normally aspirated engine -- while somewhat more sound isolated in the Q50 -- is ""coarse"" and that the 7-speed transmission is a carryover. Now, having just turned in our 2011 FX35 after 60,000 miles, I would say even if there were no improvements in the transmission in the Q50, that it is a fine transmission. Likewise, the 3.7L engine is powerful even if not particularly blessed with an abundance of torque. After driving the new Q50, the ""thrash"" and coarseness often attributed to this engine has been muted significantly, but, this mill isn't up to the smoothness of the German 6-cylinder engines and one wonders why Infiniti hasn't noticed (apparently) that forced induction engines are the currently favored configuration. Overall, the Infiniti (at least this first venture out with the new Q50) seems unlikely to be finishing as the top choice against its German and Japanese competitors. I assume Infiniti was shooting to be the darling of the ELLPS set, but came up short compared to the Lexus IS 350 [F Sport, especially]. From a styling perspective, I find the Q50 to be handsome; it looks expensive. The IS 350 is, well, ""edgy"" with its audacious styling and spindle grill. The IS looks like it would be sporty (to me, at least), whereas the Q50's style might well be more enduring since -- compared to the IS -- it is more conservative, less in-your-face. Here's something, too, the ATS -- right out of the gate -- seems to have gotten a lot MORE right than the Q50, despite what many could have assumed was a head-start what with the Q50 coming from such good stock (the G37X). Now, at least here in Cincinnati, the Q50 seems to be subvented and discounted so heavily, that they ought to be flying out of the showroom. I have never seen one on the road (other than near the dealership where they are obviously being test-driven. This is pretty amazing, considering that I have seen the outrageously priced Audi RS 7 -- a car so rarified that I actually wouldn't consider not seeing it as indicative of anything. Not once seeing a Q50 is -- speaking as a fan of the brand -- well, sad. Hopefully Johan de Nysschen, the new Infiniti president, will be able to imbue future Infinitis with some of the Audi Magic he most certainly picked up on over his 19 years with Audi. Well, there's always next year -- I'd look for some under-the-covers changes for the Q50, sooner rather than later. But I could be wrong, just not uncertain. DILYL"

I guess your equating both our return to Audis (or German cars in general) to the ""economy"" is perhaps somewhat (or more than somewhat) true, too. Yet, to be more transparent, I think it is also acccurate to say that the Japanese cars we had were (quoting my wife: ""passionless"") even though they were worthy of being described as ""premium"" class. I had so wanted the Q50 to be what its advanced press promised; and, if you'll recall, I custom ordered an IS 350 F Sport in Ultra White with a red leather interior, AWD and a bunch of options. When my wife ordered a Q5 3.0T, I tes drove the S4 and thought it to be ""beyond reach"" even though it was clearly able to outperform the IS in every way (including price.) The Audi dealer somehow came up with a lease price that made switching my plans and coming ""home"" to Audi a no brainer. So yea, the economy observation does ring true, but not the whole story. Regarding the length of my posts, well, I once again have something to go on about. I do urge anyone even thinking about the cars under discussion here to include a test drive of an S4; you may find, as did I, that an S4 is ""within reach.""

Infiniti's strong point in this segment with the Q50 are stunning good looks and gobs of power at a very reasonable price. The 3.7L VQ most definitely will not be as smooth as the German sixes. I would say Infiniti's V6 is smoother than BMW's N20 2.0 Turbo 4.

4605,"January  7, 2014  4:48PM",graphicguy,"Someone asked for a compare/contrast with the new TL SH AWD and the previous one I had, in addition to a comparison to the S4. I just can't remember which thread asked for the post, so putting it here. I'll get this out of the way up front so ""markincincinnati"" doesn't raise his blood pressure. The S4 drives better, no question. In some areas, it's significantly better, in other areas just a smidgeon better. Then there are areas where the TL SH AWD is better. First, the difference between my former 4G TL SHA AWD and this one. The new one is smoother. There's no trans ""shifting"" feeling going on. My old one had the 5 speed auto. The new one, a 6 speed. I think the ratios are closer together which might account for the smoothness. And, I believe the 6th gear has a taller ratio than the old one. One tank of gas in, 50-50 driving, I got 23 MPG. Plenty acceptable. That's about 10% better than the old TL and about the same amount better than the S4. So, I like the new trans in the TL. It's not as good as the DSG 7 speed in the S4. But, it is better than the one in the previous. Again, smooth with good manual control via the paddle shifters. The S4 will bang gears with the best of them, automatic or manual, no ifs, ands or buts. The S4 is fast, without a doubt. It's probably the fastest sports sedan I've ever driven, and will rival many muscle cars. The TL is quick. It has plenty of power, especially once you get around the 3K RPM range where the torque kicks in. The S4 has torque all over the range rev. The new 6 speed in the TL makes it feel quicker than the old one. Again, different gear ratios. Handling-the TL is FWD based, even though it has the torque vectoring tick going on (as did the S4). So, there is a difference between the S4 and the SH AWD of the TL. Not as much as you might expect, though. They're really close in the handling dept. I find myself sometimes saying, ""I liked the S4 better"". At other times I find myself saying (""the TL SH AWD is as good as the S4, and also more forgiving""). Tough to choose one over the other. Ride-this goes to the new TL. I think Acura has out BMWd BMW with the ride/handling compromise. Acura must have recalibrated the suspension in some way. It's firm without being uncomfortable. Where the S4 sometimes crashes over bumps in the road, the TL absorbs them without drama. Seat comfort goes to the TL. They were, and continue to be some of the best sports seats in any car I've ever driven. They're snug without pinching (something the S4's seats sometimes do). Fit and finish is a tie. The old TL, the new TL and the S4 are all exemplary in fit and finish. However, as with the old TL, everything in the new TL just works the way it's supposed to. That's a far cry from what I experienced with the S4. All electronics work. There's no in car internet in the TL, but I let the uber expensive in car internet lapse in the S$ because it was slow, and unneeded. Since I did let it lapse in the S4, some of the NAV maps went bonkers (next to no information about the roads being displayed on the NAV). On the TL, it's straight forward, accurate and detailed. As good as the B&O stereo was in the S4, the system in the TL (ELS) is better. It's simply one of the best factory sound systems on the market, in any car. Styling, as always, is subjective. I liked the look of the older TL. I like the look of my new one better. I'm way in the minority here, though. The S4 is classic Audi with the LCD daytime running lights that everyone seems to like these days. I liked the look of the S4, too. Here's where markincinnati and I will part. I had the check from Audi buying back my S4. I pocketed around $14K and got the new TL SH AWD Advance...as loaded as you can get one. Is the S4 better? As I started, some ways yes, other ways no. Is it $14K better? Not even close...not even $10K better, and I'd have to try really, really hard to make a case that it's $5K better. Don't get me wrong. Both are really good cars. If you're looking to blow people's doors off at stop lights, while having a good handling 4 door, the S4 is for you. If you want something more well rounded, that does a lot of things well, the TL is for you (just don't go seeking any Mustang GTs down at a stop light...wait until you get into the corners)."

4608,"January  8, 2014  5:08AM",nyccarguy,@graphicguy Great write up. You did an exemplary job at comparing thoroughly & objectively.
4609,"January  9, 2014  5:00PM",markcincinnati,"graphicguy - when I first came to the ""economic"" realization, in 2011, that I would feel the prudent choice for my next car (out of a 2009 Audi A4 Prestige) would not be another Audi (a new A4 to replace the '09 would have been about $100+ more per month and the lease term 6 months longer), I tested many brands. The 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance seemed like a good choice since it most reminded me of an Audi (and specifically it reminded me more of an S4 than an A4 2.0T with sport package.) I had read a 2010 Automobile Magazine comparison report of the S4 and TL which did say most folks would probably never cross shop the two cars, but overall, the TL SH-AWD was favorably reviewed even though it was ""out-gunned"" and out-priced by the S4. I find myself more in violent agreement with your thoughts than any other perspective. Your recent experience with an S4 certainly has made you come by your observations and opinions honestly. Indeed, your overview was balanced. The most subjective part of many purchases we make is typically ""value"" -- some folks will value an ""extra 10%"" sufficiently to allow them to cost-justify a 25% (or more in some cases) price difference. This is true in cars, clothes, food and seat choices at sporting events (to name just a few). The S4's creators, as I noted, seems to ""cost"" fun-to-drive at about $10,000 over the TL SH-AWD Advance. Today, I see the S4 as being worth the premium. In 2011, I could not cost-justify such a price delta. Bang for the buck does go to the Acura. I am thinking, too, that there are other high bang for the buck offerings available from Korea -- at the same time, I am also thinking the new Cadillac CTS is a lower value proposition than the previous generation CTS. Clearly these preferences are highly subjective. Objectively (or as objectively as possible), the Acura can be evaluated as having greater content per dollar than the Audi. Although more subjective in nature, I believe it is probable that any collection of ""professional"" reviewer's opinions about the two cars would reveal these reviewers to find the S4 more praise-worthy. Objective (measured) test results, too, would probably show the Audi's performance to be higher than the Acuras -- even if often only slightly thus. It all comes down to ""how much"" it is worth to you to have one vs the other. No such comparison is possible, given the 5-figure price difference between the two vehicles, but I wonder which car would be ""chosen"" if they were priced virtually identically and identically contented. I assume if the choice of a new loaded TL SH-AWD or a new loaded S4 were presented, and both had an asking price of $47,500, that the S4 would be chosen more frequently (the vast majority of the time.) Can't prove this, of course, but it would make for an interesting study of ""perceived value."" Today, therefore, I'll agree that the TL SH-AWD Advance offers a very high value; but, I will also -- today -- pay the upcharge for the S4 and attribute that price difference to the cost of the ""fun-to-drive"" factor. DILYL -- with the emphasis on ""you""!"
4610,"January 11, 2014  4:44PM",graphicguy,"Mark...as always...appreciate your insight. At the end of the day, that's the reason there are so many choices, particularly in the ELLPS sliver of the market. Competition keeps all of these vehicles we discuss smack in the middle of what I consider some of the most desireable cars on the road. They are certainly among the most capable cars you can drive...probably in any of the individual brands' line up. Long and short of it, there's no wrong answer here. Since I'm fresh off of test drives, it's clear where some of these manufacturers are going. BMW, for reasons that befuddle me, are softening up their cars. I suspect most will like that. Personally, I don't. But, looks like it's helping them sell more cars. Same can be said for the Infiniti Q, although that softening doesn't seem to be helping them whatsoever in selling the new Q50. Shame. Benz is going for high style. I saw pics of the new C class, and drove the CLA. I'm guessing the new C will drive similarly to the old C. Nothing compelling there. CLA shows Benz trying to become the style leader while offering run of the mill driving dynamics. Seems to be working for them as they just surpassed BMW as the U.S. luxury car sales leader. Not my cup 'o tea, but they've been successful with that strategy. Audi keeps marching to their own beat. Good for them for doing it. To me, they are the performance leaders. Owning the S4, and having had A6s for extended periods of time as loaners, I can't fathom another manufacturer doing more to imbue their cars with fun to drive characteristics (reliability needs lots of work, though) If there's one place Acura has fallen down, it's in the style dept. They've got the engineering down. Their performance is competitive, their operation, build and reliability are rock solid. I don't hold out much hope that the upcoming TL(X) will be substantially different from the RLX is style. I like it, most don't. That said, it does feel good to just have such a capable car do everything well, without worry of hiccups. Wish I could think of a pithy saying to close with. Can't. So, thanks for the input....will have to suffice."

I'm not ""old"", or ""afraid"", I simply see those as vehicles to get to my wallet by providing some marginal improvements in my life. I am what you would call ""late adopter"" (as opposed to early adopters), I get stuff only when I see a real and lasting improvement in life or business, or lack of that posession would put me in some significant disadvantage.

4625,"November 11, 2013  9:35PM",markcincinnati,"I don't want to start an argument, although I am not against arguing, if that makes any sense. But I was struck by the statements that things are becoming obsolete (perhaps the implication was ""on purpose"") every 30 months or so.  Let me provide some perspective that made me read the ""30 months"" statement and cock my head and have a cartoon balloon with a question mark in it appear overhead.  I have a 2014 Audi S4 Premium Plus with MMI+ and the B&O sound system. I also have the silk nappa leather seat upgrade.  Previously I had a 2009 Audi A4 Prestige and sport package equipped 2.0T quattro (it also had the power rear sunshade and ADS and the B&O sound system.)  Before that I had a 2005 Audi A6 3.2 with sport wheels and nav and sport seats (with the $1,000 premium leather option), the Bose sound system and the built in phone cradle and whatever else made a 2005 A6 cost nearly $54,000 new.  Now, I kept my 2005 A6 about 42 months (6 months beyond the end of the lease due to the delayed delivery in 2008 of the 2009 A4's). I kept the 2009 full term and put some 56K miles on it (and 66K miles as I recall on the '05 A6.)  One month ago I get into my new 2014 S4 configured as noted above.  If you would have put me into my new 2005 A6 and I had become familiar with the controls and the layout of everything and the functioning and format of the electronics and then you had me close my eyes for ""a second"" and re-opened them in October 2008 whilst I was seated behind the wheel of my 2009 A4, then repeated the process and I opened my eyes behind the wheel of my 2014 S4, I would have almost thought all that had changed was the color of the seats and dashboards.  My A6 had a black dash with the baseball glove colored leather seats -- the wood trim was walnut dark brown; my A4 had an ecru dash and seats -- the wood trim was oak blonde; next up, the S4 has a black dash with the magma red leather seats and carbon fiber trim.  The electronics (the automotive ""avionics"") were virtually unchanged from calendar year 2004 through 2013 (10 years, 120 months). Yes, there are some incremental (and mostly pretty small) ""improvements"" in the avionics. I can now recite an entire 10-digit phone number and the voice recognition system doesn't respond ""Pardon?"" The moving map is said to be 3D, but that's not literally true, although there is a greater perception of ""depth"" as one looks at the map (sitting or moving).  The B&O system in the 2014 MY S4 MAY be a little bit better than the excellent version of the system circa 2008 in the MY 2009 A4 (and the B&O is better than the Bose that was in the '05 A6.)  Overall, though, I would say there has been no ""built-in obsolescence"" since this car's ""systems"" have been around for 10 years without anything of any real form and/or function changing.  Now, however, therefore, notwithstanding -- I like the B8's electronics/avionics -- just as I did when I first met them in the '05 A6. I continued to enjoy them in the 2009 A4 and although I do -- from time to time -- touch the screen on the S4 thinking it has [or that it MUST have] the same capabilities that most of today's smart-phones and tablet PC's have.  Some are already saying (and have been saying so for some time now) that Audi's interior (from the driver's perspective) is long in the tooth. And, maybe, just maybe keeping the look and feel and user interface pretty much the same for 10 years is TOO long, I think the 2014 A6 interior and electronics package has taken a step back, looking like the second gen Cadillac CTS, which I didn't care for.  I keep my nav screen on almost all of the time. I would hate to have one of those aftermarket looking things (for instance, the pop-up nav that came on gen 2 CTS and the current iteration of A6's) that somehow passes for forward movement. Who's dumb idea was it to spoil the flowing lines of the newest A6 interior with that silly screen that looks, to my eye, as if it were an afterthought.  So. . .built-in obsolescence? 10 years seems about right to me."
4626,"November 11, 2013 10:05PM",robr2,"What you are looking at is the user interface. What I was talking about was the technology that delivers that user interface. That life is about 30 months.  Maintaining a known interface with just a few tweaks entices current customers to stay with the brand. For many folks, having to learn a new interface when changing car brands would be a major inconvenience. Notice that Apple hasn't changed the ""i"" interface very much. Someone who used an iPhone back in 2007 could wake up today and still be able to use an iPhone. In fact, they could probably use any touch device as Apple set a standard copied by everyone else.  I could say the same thing about Hondas. I bought my first one in 1991, a second in 1998 and a third in 2000. I can climb into just about any Honda and the interface (switches, controls) would be exactly the same. I know it's simpler than the electronic interface you mention, but it's the same idea."
4627,"November 11, 2013 10:25PM",markcincinnati,"If you are ""shielded"" from the underlying technology by an evolving not radically changing interface, why would you care if the underlying tech was changing every couple of years or so?  I would think, like the Apple iPhone, that we all appreciate that the 4 and the 5S have similar user interfaces but that the tech of the 5 is way faster, etc.  I would hope the underlying tech of my 2014 is much changed over my 2005 A6, in fact I would be ok if it changed annually even if I only change my car every 3+ years or so.  I hate to be dense, but isn't it a good thing that tech keeps marching forward?  I do agree making the thing have deliberate built-in obsolescence just for the sake of making it obsolete would make no sense; but, I am going to assume that while my Audi's user interface has little changed that the underlying stuff has changed (and for the betterment of all human-kind).  Why is it problematic [for you] that some tech is said to have become obsolete in 30 months or whatever time frame. Now the issue I would have is if the tech became unreliable or lacked durability. As far as I know the 2005 A6 MMI system works fine, lasts a long time -- but I would assume, I would hope even that the stuff underneath has been improved and improved and improved since it was first brought to market."

It had some kind of audio system that provided entertainment on straight roads (and otherwise, but it didn't matter so much then).  Now it's all about electronics.  Knock yourselves out."

Why is it problematic [for you] that some tech is said to have become obsolete in 30 months or whatever time frame.  I wasn't the one that had an issue with the obsolescence of an electronic item. I was the one that stated that hardware - especially consumer electronics - have a short expected life span. The OP had an issue with an older iPod working fine in his older BMW but not in the loaners.  IMHO, products become obsolete by the sheer pace of advances we have today. As technology improves, older items become obsolete simply because the majority abandon them and support resources need to be devoted to current technology. We can't slow down advances simply to support the last adopters."
4630,"November 12, 2013  3:25AM",dino001,"I have no problem woth changing tech as long as the old one still works at least for a while. Three years is too short, something like six may be acceptable, especially at prices charged by both Apple and BMW. I do not accept premise that perfectly functioning $200 product should be tossed out so quickly for sake of new tech that does the same thing, like playing same music files at same quality. BTW, my Nano has up to date OS, which means it is the new 328 interface not accepting it."
4631,"November 12, 2013  3:12PM",graphicguy,"I'm not so sure it's obsolescence, per se. But, I do think that the electronics aren't fully developed in cars to accept what has been a dizzying expansion of chips, PCBs, computers and software used to operate cars.  Amazing to me that the (using another acronym) ECU to precisely measure the exact amount of fuel required in each cylinder to maximize power and economy is amazing in and of itself. Overall, the car companies have that one nailed.  Another case in point, it's pretty amazing that most cars with the capability to tell the driver when his oil needs to be changed, based on sensors monitoring operating temp, mode of driving, etc, is equally amazing.  Where they fall down, is they don't put as much effort into understanding how the stereo is supposed to work with an iPod (probably the single most ubiquitous media device currently on the planet). Or, in Audi's case, how they can't even get CDs to play correctly. This, a technology that's been around for at least 30 years (and will probably be dead before the end of the decade).  It's not just Audi I'm picking on. I've heard wide spread reports of this from people who own GM cars, the issues with Ford's Sync, etc. Even my BMW E92 had stereo and NAV issues (minor in comparison to the Audi MMI), and that platform had been around for awhile.  My personal opinion, if you're going to be nonchalant about the electronics and features of your cars, don't put them in the car to begin with. They again, they appear to be ""behind the time"" if they don't have those features. So, they prefer to half-assed measures just so they can list a ""feature"" in marketing brochures.  One thing I have to do, is to tip my hat to the Japanese lux manufacturers. There's not one Acura, Lexus or Infiniti that I've been in that the tech hasn't worked the way it's supposed to. They put the effort and time in to make it work.  Speaking of which, just got off the phone with the Audi dealer. They still don't know what's wrong, but do have the MMI apart (assuming the dash is apart, as is the console since the MMI controller resides there). I inquired about the trans/Quattro binding issue. They haven't even begun that trouble shooting process. They did say the Audi ""rep"" is due to come in to look at my car. But, that's not until mid next week.  So, I'm still tooling around in their A6 2.0. While this is a nice car. It's not an Sx Audi vehicle. We had a dusting of snow this a.m. It did just fine. But, it's a big car. As good as the 4 cyl turbo is, (and it's really good), it's still hauling around a heavy car, and you feel it."
4632,"November 12, 2013  7:36PM",sweendogy,"That is the question? After a great run in the G- yes it's been 7 model years and 38k miles - my G finally gave me some trouble- the drivetrain belt (alternator belt?) shredded on the highway a few miles from work- was able to limp the car into the lot and had it towed to dealer for the 200bux repair. Made me think time for an upgrade? But then again it was only 200 bux to fix, but could this be the beginning of other more major issues to happen...I've never owned a car out of warrantee before- made me worry. Checked out the new q in the dealership, nice looking rig but the consumer reports article still rates the g higher. Plus they are not cheap and few deals around this far. 2 other options a cpo 335x (pre new body) or a cpo Audi s4.

4633,"November 12, 2013  7:40PM",markcincinnati,"Although I wasn't as active a participant here (and elsewhere) whilst I had my 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance, I was a frequent reader of the postings and musings of those who participated those ""lonely"" 28 months.  I would not hesitate to recommend an Acura such as the one I had -- I would, however, try to put things into perspective for someone shopping for one of these ELLPS vehicles. The Acura was ______________ (fill in the blank with some mostly positive comments) and it remains an attractive car considering its price and (at the time) considering the fact that it is/was heavily discounted (13% off sticker in my case). I will still remember it as Acura's S4 (despite the fact that few would ever cross-shop the two cars).  If you're looking to enter into ELLPS land ""on the cheap"" I would say you can't do better than go for one of the current TL SH-AWD versions (the FWD version, however, does not qualify). However, in response to comments about Acura's ""tech/electronics"" working (apparently compared to Audi's MMI+), well I know it is a ""nit"" but the voice response software (at least in mine) would not function according to the owner's manual. I called Acura and took my car to the dealer (who had an Acura tech super user as a sales rep) -- both sources say the voice activation did have ""bugs"" in it. Moreover, when I asked Acura if there would be a fix, they said ""no updates are in the pipeline at this time.""  I have (remembering that I have had three different MMI cars since 2005) had my ""MMI OS"" -- what I would call ""windows for the car"" updated once on the 2005 and once on the 2009 -- and nothing so far on the 2014. I never had and still have never had any issues with my MMI+ equipped Audis. And, everything works.  On my Acura, for example, the car can have the voice activation system set to a REALLY annoying configuration where the voice system essentially mimics everything you say after you say it and before it does it. It can be turned off (same thing on my wife's 2011 Infiniti FX) -- when the voice prompt system is turned to ""minimalist"" mode, it is pretty easy to live with since it doesn't delay and doesn't parrot back your commands as if you might not really have meant what you asked of it. But, when in minimalist mode, functions (voice commands) that the manual says work . . .won't.  The Acura has no clock that is easy to locate at a glance. However, it has a feature that allows you to simply ask, out loud, ""what time is it?"" And, the voice system recites the correct time. I thought it was a fairly neat little command that I often used when I was alone in the car and, well, er -- SPEEDING. I could, without hunting on my wrist or the dash panel simply say ""what time is it?"" The system would comply and tell me the time of day.  However, this feature was ""disabled"" (and Acura said it should work regardless of the setting of the voice system to ""annoying"" mode) unless the voice response system was set to ""long mode"" (annoying mode).  Another annoying feature was the phone number input (by voice) which would inevitably put a zero in front of the number I was dialing -- or sometimes it would put a ""#"" sign and announce the character as ""POUND.""  Overall, the Acura system worked fairly well -- but there were more quirks in it than in any of my 3 Audis or my wife's tech package FX. Over the course of 28 months, I rarely used the voice command capability because it was either a little frustrating or annoying to use. MMI, by comparison is almost like ""natural language"" (almost).  The Infiniti system, too, rarely gets it wrong and doesn't require any time at all to learn to use.  The point, belabored for sure, is that I (a voice of one) found the Acura system ""more trouble than it was worth"" and also a system that wasn't nearly as intuitive as my wife's BMW (2008) or her 2011 Infiniti or any Audi I've had with the voice feature.  To each his/her own to be sure -- but I'm all for updating the tech systems on these cars ASAP and with as much frequency as it takes to get the bugs out. :surprise:  DILYL"
4634,"November 12, 2013  8:39PM",markcincinnati,"I'm so far beyond biased, it makes everything I say possibly specious -- but I remain, after all, ""Often wrong, but NEVER uncertain"" -- but here goes:  Audi -- if you hold much stock in CR has moved up the ""reliability"" ratings with each passing year, arriving recently as the #4 ranked vehicle with respect to reliability. I would say that CR is good at the collecting of a good sized sample which makes them a very good resource for objective data (such as reliability and one would think durability, too.)  Generally speaking, ""everyone wants to be Audi"" -- or so says at least one or two ""Car & Driver"" type magazines when they wax poetic about auto brands in recent months.  Remarkably too, Audi's cars keep coming in close to the top or at the top of the heap in comparison tests. Most recently the A6 3.0T schooled its most worthy competition and even beat the new CTS (and the CTS's target was the BMW 5, which, in this case it did beat -- but so did the Mercedes in the test.)  Since everything does go in cycles, I would say, even with my considerable bias, ""this can't last."" Now is the time to make a move and get the Audi before it begins what -- eventually -- will be ""slippage."" Moreover, if you want something that has been modified and modified and slightly refreshed (last year) meaning it is perhaps the ""best one ever,"" I would think you would be hard pressed to build a better mousetrap than a 2014 A4 OR S4. Now, I may eat my words, but my '14 S4 is an absolute joy to drive. It is damn near a ""masterpiece.""  How I hope that the S4 may be tested (as was the BMW 3) against everyone's favorite newcomer -- the Lexus IS 350 F-Sport (my first choice in this class when I thought the S4 would be out of reach financially.)  In any case, the new Q50 seems to have missed the mark if you believe at least 3 auto enthusiast magazines and CR, so your choices are somewhat limited unless you want to re up for a new (last MY) G37X/Sport.  Now may be the time ""to Audi.""  But, like I said, I'm biased -- often wrong, just NOT uncertain.  DILYL"

Worse, it looks like BMW realized the driver's need to know exactly when to turn so engineers have thought of placing a bar on the monitor that gets shortened as you approach the turn 800ft-600ft-200ft.

In fairness, I haven't driven the new CTS, nor the new E350. I drove a 535i during the BMW drive event. And, I agree that it feels like a ponderous brick on the road (except, I too like the 3.0 Turbo motor, but more in a 3 series than the bigger, heavier 5).  I wish my issues with the S4 weren't so confounding. And, that Audi's efforts to fix it weren't so feeble. I might consider another Audi. As it stands, I'm going to battle with them."

We went ahead and took one ""on the boat"" so we ended up with an SQ5 Prestige with Magma Red leather and Panther Black paint ($1,075 option: OUCH!).  These two S cars are the quickest vehicles I have ever driven -- save for a Corvette I rented for a day for a friend's birthday. Now that I have 2,000 miles on the S4 it seems to be coming into that ""first wind"" that every Audi seems to get fully at about 5,000 miles and again around 10,000 miles.  My wife asked me to floor the S4 on an entrance ramp here on the I-275 loop that surrounds Cincinnati -- before I knew it, and before I even ran out of ramp, I was at 90mph. I had to slow down to merge for pity's sake.  Somehow the tuning of the SQ5's 8-speed Tiptronic seems to resemble the S-Tronic in the S4 pretty closely. The SQ5 shifts more often (duh!) and at full throttle makes those same fart sounds at shift points just like the S4.  Combining military grade power with luxury is no mean feat -- but Audi has done it again with the SQ5. We even test drove a Cayenne (which costs more) and it didn't have the power and urge of the SQ5. It seems to get this much power in a Cayenne you have to resign yourself to a 6 figure purchase. We got my wife's SQ5 at 6% off sticker plus $1,000 loyalty bonus.  The S cars will look pretty cool sitting in the garage, too: hers is black and mine is white.  We went ahead and got the 20"" Audi OE inch wheels (it came with 21""'s which you can't get all season UHP tires in the correct size) and we had the dealer take off the stock summer only tires and replaced them with new Continental Extreme Performance DWS UHP A/S's.

In regards to the CTS, I was in Ft Lauderdale and San Diego this week and at National Car Rental I spoke to the manager of both locations and was told they are expecting the new 2014 CTS by Jan.. So once I get one I'll post what I think. I had a 2014 ATS Performance in San Diego. Even though the ATS ""handles"" better then the 3 series, I liked the overall ""package"" that the 3 series offers. The ATS is too small for my liking, this was the issue I had with my 328i.

4645,"November 29, 2013  4:45PM",markcincinnati,"Andres3 -- wait until you get over 1,000 miles on the OD; at that mileage the power improves and the fuel consumption drops. I did notice a slight decrease in the oil level (on the MMI screen), but the indicator still says ""OK.""  If this is your first Audi, you will be getting 2 new ones in the future. Your ""second"" new Audi will come to your garage (at no extra charge) at 5,000 miles (or so) and then you will find yet another new Audi at 10,000 miles. Now, I say this never having had an Audi supercharged engine, but every other Audi I've ever had (4, 5, 6 or 8 cylinder, naturally aspirated or forced induction) repeated the ""rebirth"" at the noted mileage. Never had the same experience with the various Acura, Infiniti or BMW's we have had over the years.  WE almost always do this: ""I wish"" I had configured the sport differential on my order; ""I wish"" 19"" wheels with A/S UHP tires were offered as an option; ""I wish"" the tracking headlights were offered on the P+ S4 (like are on my wife's new Prestige SQ5); and I wish the A/S tires were not simply Grand Touring models, but UHP's like we put on the SQ5 (Continental DSW's). But, even without my wish list, this is (these two cars -- my S4 and her SQ5 are) the best Audis ever, AND my (and my wife's) most favorite cars -- ever.  Every time I push the start button, put the car in dynamic mode (which actually the car ""remembers"" from the first time) and take off, I am impressed by the seemingly intuitive transmission and the sense of an almost unlimited well of horsepower and torque. Now that I have 2,000 miles on mine, I am unafraid to floor the accelerator, and find it to be an absolute rush every time I do.

4646,"December  4, 2013  4:41PM",flightnurse,"So I haven't been traveling so much for work, out of state (that is), but have been working in Tucson. On my trips down and back, I have been averaging 36 MPG, this is doing anywhere between 55-80. The traffic between these cities have gotten really back over the years. Before you could set the cruise at 80 and just go.  So for thanksgiving, I went over to San Diego to see my dad, I-10 west, through Palm Spring, Riverside, and down the I-15 to San Diego. Weather was clear, temps in the mid to high 60s for most of the trip, no A/C needed. Average speed was 75, I averaged 38.5 MPG (car trip computer), however, when I filled up the car took 12 gallons at 460 miles (38.3 mpg), on the way home, temps in the upper 70's to low 80's A/C average speed 80, 37.5 mpg (cars trip computer), 465 miles used 12.5 gallons which is 37.2 mpg. So the car's trip computer is fairly accurate in the MPG.  So a few thoughts on this car, I have 3800 miles on it (much higher then I thought I would have) but this is the nature of my work.  1) The start/stop feature, it is unnerving when you first get in the car and it stops. You get the WTF just happened. Now having the car for 2 months, it is second nature, doesn't bother me at all.  2) Power, the car is rated at ""only"" 180 hp, but in my daily driving and highway cruising, the power band and torque are set that one would be hard pressed to tell, my last rental was a 2014 Sonata, and while the standard engine make about 200hp, the 320i ""felt faster"" then the Sonata's. BTW, I just ordered the Stage 1 tuning kit for the 320, 30hp gain and 40 lbs of torque gain for $375. stage 2 is in beta test but from the prelim testing, on a 320i stage two add's another 20 hp and 30 lbs of torque for another $175. MPG is not to be affected at all with these upgrades under normal driving (well see about that.)  3) Handling and ride of the new F30 I read people's comments about the steering feel of the new F30, granted it does have the weighted feel of the E90 or the current 1 series and X1, but in daily driving one is really hard pressed to know the lack of feedback. I'm sure on the track it is a completely different story. The ride of the non-sport F30 is typical German, well controlled without it being too harsh, now, my E90 with the M sport pack and run flat tires wasn't so bad if the road was smooth, but as we all know, not many cities have ultra smooth road, and that combo get's tiresome after a while. Do I wish for better supportive seats, YES, but over all, no real complaints. I was not tired at all on my trip to San Diego, my first stop is always just north palm spring which takes about 4 hours to get, no sore butt or fatigue at all.  Has BMW last some of the edge that the 3 series had, yes, BMW was always more of a ""sport"" sedan, then a ""luxury"" sedan but the people with the money (buyers) want more luxury which is fine, but I think BMW can make both sides happy without really compromising too much, I just hope they find the happy medium.  Some grips about what has become of the 3 series, when building a new 3 series, the only two interior color one can get with the sport pack is black or red. If you want other colors you have to get the M sport pack, Luxury model or standard. I wish the enhanced bluetooth and alarm was standard.  With that being said, I like the 320i, it does want I want it to do, the price was reasonable and the resale value of the 320i seems to high on it, but time will tell."
4647,"December  6, 2013  2:17PM",graphicguy,"Nice write up FN. Sounds like a very good car.  I know when I had mine, I thought the power was way under rated (at least from what BMW claimed). Sounds like they did the same with the 320i. I had the performance pack installed on mine for an extra 20 HP. Well worth the money.  Maybe the 320i is the spiritual successor to the 2002ti."

If Acura improves the 5 or 6 key points of problems I noticed with the TL-SH-AWD, they will have a winner on their hands with the 2015 version.  1) no plastic trim/rails on the roof! 2) 330+ HP 3) Dual Clutch Transmission please! 4) 200+ pounds lighter, & more balanced weight distribution (such as moving front brake calipers to back side of wheel). 5) Make the awesome sound system with DVD-A standard. 6) Make the good leather (Milano Leather) standard. Offer the brown leather interior color in more than just the Advance trimming. 7) Offer better colors and more selection! 8) Make it better looking and more stylish.  9) Sell it for $40K out the door Taxes included.

Her leather is nicer than the leather I have in the S4. So, I guess the key is to get the upper models of the TL to get the real ""goodies"".

4655,"November  5, 2013 12:00AM",andres3,"I'll be the first to knock initial quality as a relatively useless thing.  After all, my lemon-like Dodge Neon had reasonably OK initial quality. It was the long term quality that reared its ugly head over and over.  The problem was there was no long term quality, it was planned to be obsolete the day after 3 years or the mile after 36,000.  That being said, there were some early tell tale signs that it was not going to be an acceptable car. My view is if I have a significant amount of problems in the first 3 years, odds are it'll be exponentially more after warranty. Then again, my friends Altima blew it's engine and transmission in its first month, and ended up being extremely reliable for about 5-6 years, and then all hell broke loose again.  2nd failed CVT transmission and failed CAT Converter (both covered by Nissan because Nissan knows they are failure prone). I'm still waiting for a ""extended Neon"" warranty check from Chrysler.  Not holding my breath though, it's obvious that Chrysler's culture views a car that has failed head gaskets, AC compressor, and auto transmission all by 60,000 miles (in addition to about 15 other things that broke) as perfectly normal. As the dealer service manager told me ""parts just break down.""  My experience at Honda and Audi and (my best friend with Nissan) is just the polar opposite, it is a culture where parts breakdowns are unacceptable! If it happens, they seem to do they're absolute best at minimizing them.  For example, Honda replacing my transmission out of warranty at 42K miles for free, and doing it in 2.5 days. Audi fixed my AC at 53,000 miles out of warranty in a very similar manner (though it took 2 weeks, but I had an A4 loaner so I was happy). Audi sending me a check for nearly $700 for failed induction control modules since it was warrantied retroactively to 120,000 miles, and my best friends experience with Nissan above.  My AC failed at literally year 3 - day 3 (under 36K miles), and Dodge never blinked an eye for offering assistance.  Head gaskets at 40 or 45k, Dodge dealer made no comment.  Auto transmission at 60k (independent shop's comment was ""I can't believe they are still using those cheap ancient 3-speeds."")  I think I'm justified in not only boycotting the Big 3 for life, but forbidding my children (at least until age 18 I think I can) to give the Big 3 any money. After 18 I'll just have to disown them if they do so. :P"

They put me in an A6...only this time with the 4 cyl turbo. I wanted one with the 3.0 S/C. But, the only loaners they had were the A6 and an A4 with the same motor. I took the A6.  Surprisingly, the 4 cyl turbo in the A6 does a good job. It's certainly light years smoother than BMW's 4 turbo. Understand, this is a heavy car. And, there's a noticeable fall off in acceleration with the turbo 4. But, if you're not really a performance car enthusiast, you get the handling and ride of the A6 with a wee bit of ""sprightliness"" thrown in.  Not sure the difference in price between it and the A6 3.0, but if anyone's in the market for an A6, and one can be had in the low $40K range (not sure about that last part), it might be worh a look."

Like the BMW there is a chip for the Audi (really VW) turbo 4, which will increase HP to roughly 256hp, and increase torque to about 290lbs total cost about $350.

But, he did download some sort of firmware. He said I should test it when I ge the car back. I told him my iPod and CDs are still in the car. All he has to do is to plug in the iPod or play a CD to see if they still cut out all the time.  He sounded frustrated, but said he would. When I inquired about the next step if it doesn't work, he said they'd have to remove the entire dash and colsole to get the MMI out...to replace the MMI.

For ~$40K (using available discounts), I'd probably spring for another Acura TL SH AWD with Tech package. I'm really interested to see what Acura brings out next spring with the new TL(X).  To get what I want in a 3 Series, I'd probably have to go with at least a 328ix (with the preference being a 335ix). Equipped the way I want, assuming a $3K-$4K discount, I'd still be in that upper $40K range, into the low $50K range.

Moreover, you get the really cool (pun intended) vented seats -- and, most importantly blind spot monitoring.  I know y'all will give me grief, but FOR THE MONEY the TL SH-AWD Advance is Acura's version of an S4.  The thing is, for most, just too ugly, hence no matter what I say to anyone they just can't get past the looks.  Again, for the money, the Acura as noted above is worth cross shopping with the S4 -- now, is the Acura likely to be confused with the S4? Nope.  Is the S4, lightly optioned, worth $10,000 more than the TL? Yep.  Would most folks cross shop these two cars? I doubt it.  If you can't or don't want to afford an S4 and the new Q50 leaves you cold, your only ""cheap"" choice is the TL SH-AWD Advance. All in with the TL, adding parktronic and upgrading the tires to 19"" UHP ""Z"" or ""Y"" or ""W"" rated rubber, you're going to be at $47K or maybe $48K (MSRP).  BTW: I am not excluding the BMW 335i x-drive -- but, like the S4, it seems (or seemed) to be made of unobtanium; and for some reason the 3 series seems a bit small to me.  The IS 350 F Sport doesn't have the engine the Audi S4 has, of course; and, frankly, the Acura at 305HP feels no less potent than the IS 350.  My S4 is a premium plus S-tronic version in free paint -- Ibis White -- with the upgraded leather seats, MMI+, Blind Spot monitoring, B&O sound system and carbon fiber trim (which looks nice, but for $500? Naaaah.) With shipping the thing was $57K -- $10K more than the TL and $7K more than an IS 350 AWD F-SPORT.  I drove:  Q50S AWD IS 350 AWD F-Sport Volvo S60 Type/R (also AWD) Acura TL SH-AWD Advance Audi A4 2.0T Sport Audi A5 2.0T Sport Audi S4 S-Tronic Audi S4 6-speed manual shift Audi SQ5 8-speed Tiptronic (Prestige)  Thinking an S4 (my preference) was ""out of reach"" and not thinking the A4 or A5 2.0T versions had sufficient ""guts,"" and reading the critical reviews of the Q50S, I ordered a 2014 IS 350 AWD F-SPORT in Ultra White with the red leather interior.  My wife, meanwhile, was smitten with the SQ5 Prestige and ordered that. While we were filling out the paperwork on her SQ5, I commented how much I would rather have the S4 than the IS, but that the price of the S4 made it seem to be constructed out of unobtainium.  Days later, Audi dealer says -- I can get you a white S4 S-Tronic with magma red leather and the blind spot warning (which was a deal breaker or maker option) -- and we think, with no money down, we can meet the Lexus' price since you are now eligible for the Audi loyalty discount (since your wife has also rejoined the Audi family.)  The moral of the story: if you can't or don't want to ""afford"" the S4 (or whatever your passion inducing car is), of all of the remaining choices, you will have to give up less if you get the TL SH-AWD Advance than any other car on the ELLPS list -- and you will surely pay less (comparably equipped).

4697,"October 31, 2013  2:22PM",graphicguy,"Mark...thanks for your insight.  Not sure where I'm going from here. I heard last week that my S4 will probably need a new trans. Granted, it's covered under warranty. But, this is just one in an ongoing series of trips into the service area of the dealership. That, and it seems it could take as long as a month to get it fixed.  Ordinarily, I'd get into the whole ""lemon law"" thing, but I still like the car, believe it or not. It's clear I'm not going to keep it long term, however. So, the quandry becomes how much of a hit will I take if I hold onto it, and try to sell/trade it, and that CARFAX shows all the service it has needed?  I'm going to have to make up my mind relatively quickly here. If I lemon it (I don't think I'll get much pushback), what do I replace it with? This isn't the first time I've lemoned a car (helped my late Mother lemon law her Cadillac several years ago). I know the drill. It'll take a couple of months.  Another Audi? Probably not.  Cadillac? The new CTS intrigues me, but I'm not ponying up another $50K for a car. Plus, there's my lemon law experience with them....not good.  Infiniti....boy, I try and try to like them. I just can't seem to embrace their cars, for a variety of reasons. Same goes for Mercedes. I always feel like I would be paying too much for an underpowered German sedan with them....particularly compared to the competition.  Lexus? I liked the previous IS, except it was small for my tastes. GS? Maybe.  I do think BMW is on the short list. But, as you say, just like the S4, the one I'm interested in (335) is tought to find. Plus, you're breaking way past that $50K mark if you do find one. The M235 intrigues me. There again, you have a size ""thing"".  I do like Acuras. As you say, the TL SH AWD Advance is right there. Plus, from what I'm reading, getting one all loaded up for right around $40K is compelling. I drove my sister's TL a while ago. I may have to borrow hers again.  First things first...I have to decide what to do with the S4."

In addition, the car has been in the dealer's service dept for numerous other issues (some of which couldn't be resolved...like MMI issues) for another 10-12 days (I have to tally them up).  Dealership states that they don't know which parts will be needed UNTIL the trans is out, which makes the car undriveable. So, yeah...it could take awhile, given the parts come from Germany.  I do love the car. I don't like the hassle of taking it to the dealership, seemingly every other week.  It's not a lease...it's a purchase. If it was a lease, I'd just keep it for what would be the next 16-17 months and not worry about it.  Ray...I thought you were done with BMWs?

Full disclosure, my Advance wheels were bent from the get-go, and Acura decided that they would pay only 50% of the cost of the new wheels since they weren't ""discovered"" as bent until 20K miles (I first complained at the first oil change which was just south of 8,000 miles, but Acura thought I had warped brake rotors, not BENT wheels -- so I was given the opportunity to buy factory OE wheels [19""] at the bargain basement price of $650-ish per.)

4712,"October 24, 2013  2:33PM",graphicguy,"You guys peaked my interest. Since one of the local Benz dealers is close to my home, I wandered over there last night to look at the CLA. They had 2 of them (they said they initially had 4 but already sold two). One was $38K MSRP. It didn't have leather, nor the ""fancy"" diamond grill you see in the TV ads (it's an option).  They wanted me to do a test drive. I declined. For nearly $40K, I think I'll pass. You can get a nice A4 for that money....or, an ATS....or a 320i...all of which I think are nicer vehicles. Heck...you can get a loaded up Acura ILX for less than that. Or, in reality, a G37x is selling for less than that these days. Just a hunch, but I'd say any of the above would be better cars than the CLA.  No doubt they'll sell a lot of them...at least initially.

4713,"October 24, 2013  2:43PM",graphicguy,"m6...I pulled this out of my old file when I had my TL a few years ago. This is what Acura stated about the oil life monitor...  ""The TL has a Maintenance Minder system that automatically monitors the vehicle's unique operating condition to indicate to the driver when maintenance is required. Maintenance alerts are presented when the ignition is first turned on, not while driving (to prevent driver distraction). The system monitors engine operating conditions such as fluid temperatures and engine speed to determine the proper service intervals. The Multi-Info Display (MID) located below the fuel and engine temperature gauges in the instrument cluster indicates the remaining percentage of engine oil life, and then shows service is due with a ""wrench"" icon. A percentage-based countdown to the next service is displayed when the car is within 15 percent of the end of the service interval. A letter and number code is displayed to indicate the specific type of service that is required. If the service is missed, the MID indicates past-due mileage to express the urgency of the required service to the driver.  The system is designed to eliminate unnecessary maintenance procedures, environmental impact and expenses, while ensuring that important service issues are addressed. In some cases, oil change intervals can extend to a maximum of 10,000 miles, which could spare the owner considerable money and inconvenience over the life of the car. The owner-resettable system monitors all normal service parts and systems, including oil, oil filter, tire rotation, air-cleaner, automatic transmission fluid, spark plugs, timing belt, coolant, brake pads and more.""  Thinking back to when the manufacturers stated oil change intervals based on mileage alone, I think the monitors might give a more accurate guesstimate on when your oil is depleted.  I remember a mechanic friend who I would consult in my younger days of building a (money pit) track car, telling me he could tell if the oil was depleted just by smell and by rubbing the dip stick in between his fingers. I was amazed at that. Until I realized all he was doing was feeling for grit in the oil, and trying to determine if the oil smelled ""burnt"". Not very scientific. Of course, we didn't use synth oil, either."

You would have thought that a Kardashian kid had showed up, there were so many people surrounding the car.  Like you noticed, the two they had on the lot were stickered in the $36-38K range. Quite a bit of money for what is a pretty small car. I guess everyone wants to play in the 'compact luxury' arena these days.  I agree with you - those people wanting something sporty will probably shop elsewhere. 320i, A4, ATS would be good alternatives.  Where it gets tricky is that you can option up some more pedestrian brands to that mid 30's price range - Optima, Accord, Fusion - and get way more features for the money.

There must be some reason that Audi would understate the power of one (or more for all I know) of their engines. Maybe it is a tax thing in Germany. Whatever the reason, it seems to me that there is no way this car has only 333 HP and 325 lb ft.  I had heard that the 2.0T's power as it stands in the current A6 is understated (and I have driven the car and it does seem impossible that it is 220 HP motivating a car that big) and I read a test report of the S8 that wagged its finger at Audi for understating that engine, too, so I guess it must be an Audi practice to under-rate their engines.  Of course, other than for tax reasons (if that really is true), why would they do this? I recall that Acura (and others) had to restate the power of the RL's 3.7L V6 (to less than 300 HP), suggesting to me that most car companies would probably like to find a way to overstate the power numbers (HP measured at sea level on a cold day, for instance).  In any case, even with less than 1,000 miles on it, the S4 seems to have great, surprising, reserves of power -- perhaps sports car power. An RS version must be dangerous, if this S version is any indication.  Once again, I find myself wondering why the recent spate of car magazine sport sedan comparos doesn't include this car!?"

Well, for reasons I cannot imagine -- other than the fact that here in Ohio we have raised the top speed limit from 65 to 70mph (and EVERYBODY does limit+10 and lots do limit+20) -- I got in with a ""pack"" of cars cruising along between 85 and 90, and for the hell of it, I got in the left lane and punched it for just a couple of seconds: an indicated 101mph ""just like that!"" Poof.  I'm destined to get a ticket. Thank god for cruise control.  End note1: it must be the all season tires, but this is one of the quietest cars (even at speed) I have ever been in.  End note2: this is a 2014, yes? Yes. Why in the wide wide world of sports does the ""iPhone/iPod adapter only have the iPhone 3, 4 and 4S ""big"" connector? I have a now outdated iPhone 5 and it uses the new ""little"" connector. The solution (and no charge) was for the dealer to give me an Audi connector that has a USB female plug on it. I take the 110 volt AC plug off of the cable, plug the USB male into the female and I at least have the ability to keep the iPhone charged. I don't seem to have any of the control or selection features I would have if I had an iPhone 4. This means, I turn on Bluetooth, plug in the USB, fire up the system and punch up whatever I want to listen to ON THE PHONE itself, then put the phone in the glove box and let whatever playlist I have selected run its course.  My ""old"" Acura TL worked perfectly and seemed way way better integrated with both my iPhone and my Kindle Fire (which I used to use for audio books; now I use an iPhone app to do the same thing.)  Endnote3: I got used to having the garage door opener work with the car turned off on the Acura, can't do it on the Audi. This means you have to close the garage door with the engine running -- I know it is only a few seconds, but with all the software controlled things the MMI permits/enables, you'd think there could be a menu item that lets you choose what will operate with the engine off. I know this is a picking of the nits, but there needs to be a software update to take care of some of the little things that shouldn't be on a nearly $57K car.

Back in 2006, I was reading these forums for Audi and BMW but in the end bought a Honda because I knew I wasn't going to be driving much -- the 7 year old Honda has just over 23k miles.  However, I'm thinking of getting something better and one thing that might drive my choice would be what kind of European Delivery program the manufacturer offers. Back 7 years ago, I think only BMW was doing ED and there were packages to drive through Switzerland and down into Italy, Lake Como to be specific.  The savings, with FOB originating in Munich, could result in a lease that saved you enough to pay for the trip to Germany (maybe not to tour around Europe though).  I see now that Mercedes and Audi are offering ED again.  So do these and the BMW ED programs still offer substantial savings on leases?  I still won't drive that much so I don't need a lot of miles per year but I'd at least start off with a good tour in Europe."

4741,"October 22, 2013  6:31AM",flightnurse,"Graphic, I have only driven the car about 200 miles, but so far...  Power: Very adequate for daily driving, merging onto the freeway or driving around town the turbo engine has an effortless to it. Whether you get the 320 or 328 the cars have three modes for power-train, Sport, Normal/comfort and Eco. Sport the engine mapping is changed as well as shift points. Shifts at a higher RPM, the throttle has an aggressive feel to it. The transmission will rapidly fire off shift very much like Duel clutch auto does. Normal is really ""comfort"" the transmission shifts more smoothly and the engine mapping isn't as aggressive. So far this is where I leave it. Eco is just that, the throttle has a lazier feel to it and the transmission will get into higher gear quicker. Having the car in sport and accelerating from a stop light/sign the car ""feel"" quicker and the shifts are quicker than the advertise 180hp. Also there very little TURBO LAG in this car. Truly impressed with it. I did drive a 328i and was very impressed with it. Now granted, these are 4 cyl and are not as smooth as the 6 cyl, no, but overall one would be hard pressed to know there is a 6 cyl under the hood.  Engine Not as smooth as the 6cyl, when the 4 cyl is cold it is rougher and courser, but once at operating temperature things smooth out a little. The Auto start/stop…. It&#146;s unnerving to come to a stop and the engine dies, however, when the A/C is running the engine will stop for roughly 20-30 seconds but will restart and stay running. When the engine is cold it will not stop, it must be at operating temp for this feature to run. I have decided to allow this feature to work, I want to see if it really bothers me. There are times when the engine restarts and it&#146;s rougher than others. We all know this feature is to help with MPG, and once BMW gets their MPG up, this feature will go away. The 328d is start…  Driving Now I only have about 200 miles of butt time in the car, so of course my impressions will change. Now I have had an E36 328i, E46 330i, E90 328i and now this F30 320i. They all drive the same but different. They all had/have that tectonic feel to them that only the Germans can do. All of the other BMWs have had the sport package, this is my first without it. I don&#146;t have enough butt time to really make a true statement on the seats, currently I&#146;m not 100% happy with them but I&#146;m not 100% disappointed with them either. I can say that this is the quietest 3 series I have owned, there is no wind noise at the A pillars at all, when you close the doors, they close with that German tank &#147;thunk&#148;. The steering, I have read both in print and in this forum how people hate the elec steering and how &#147;numb&#148; it feels. There is a difference between my pervious 3 series and this current car, it is lighter which is nice when parking. Now can I say that the steer has no feedback, no, and I don&#146;t think anyone can say that for certain until you take the car out on the track and drive to 6/10 of the cars potential. So far, the steering has not been an issue for me. I haven&#146;t driven it on the track and I highly doubt I will, but one never knows.  Base Car; So all BMWs now come with the latest iDrive (ver 4.2), and I like it. It is very easy to use, and it make it very easy to get around and make the necessary changed to the car settings. Yes, there is a learning curve to it but I like it. I wish my car had the BMW assist, which I will have it added to the car, this is one feature in which I wish it came standard in the 2013 MY, it does for the 2014 MY. The features of this base car is pretty impressive, it has all power everything, it even has power side mirror to retract in (I just wish they would retract automatically.) Auto temp, rain senor wipers, fog lights, and auto headlights. I can set the ventilation system to run the fans while I&#146;m away from the car to help keep the car cool, it&#146;s a nice feature here in the desert. All four windows are auto down. One annoying feature is, to get out, the car does not auto unlock the car is placed park or turning the car off, and to get out of the car, you must pull door handle twice, first to unlock the car and the second to open the door. I&#146;m not understanding this feature… Wheels, standard is 17&#148;, and mine came with Michelin run flat tires. I was surprised on not seeing Continental tires.  The interior space is pretty big, I had 4 adults&#146; males in the car roughly my size 6&#146;, 260lbs and everybody didn&#146;t feel cramped. MPG for the car has been impressive, Rick tells me that the car is averaging currently 32 MPG. So a 550 miles range on the highway is very doable.  On the forum Bimmerfest, there has been talk about the engine difference between the 320 and 328 and according from BMW there is no difference except for a higher boost level and different engine mapping in the 328i, there is a performance company that has two different set up for the 320i for more power, stage one is a true plug in which give the 320i an extra 40 hp. Total cost, $375. Stage two again is a plug in and gives an extra 80hp to 260hp, more than the 328i but less than the 335. Total cost is $600. Reliability hasn&#146;t been an issue with the test cars, btw, all test cars for the company have the 8 spd auto.  I bought this BMW as an experiment really to see if the &#147;base&#148; 3 series, has the same DNA as previous 3 series and if the price of admission is worth it. So my car is equipped how most would find on a BMW lots, with the Premium package. Now I can say that the Sport Package is really worth the price of admission, since it comes with the M sport suspension. From what I have read on Bimmerfest, the 320i Sport Package is really the M Sport Package minus the M sport aero kits, the Steering wheel has the M logo on it. So far I like the car, and yes it is bigger than the E90, but it is lighter than the E90. Of course many people on Bimmerfest and this forum do not like the F30, I read people saying that it has lost the &#147;sport&#148; in Sport Sedan. But to honest when the E90 came out many of the BMW purest were the saying the same thing, and in some way I was one of them. The E46 was and is today the best 3 series BMW built. But as we all know things change, and buyers change and the market change. I&#146;m in the camp that I wish BMW would build a modern 3 series the ZHP package again.  Now I welcome all questions and comments, however, if the comments are purely being disrespectfully then please keep them to yourself.  FN"

4752,"October 23, 2013  1:28PM",dino001,"I experienced first real failure in my now 2-year old 328 wagon. It was the liftgate latch assembly. One nice morning the car is showing ""gate open"" warning, so I got out, closed it again. The warning is still on, so I try again and again. No avail. What's also strange, the glass window in the gate (yes, similar feature to those on bog SUVs) would not open. As it turned, the dealer is replacing both latch assemblies, gate and glass window. I'm sure it's one of those classic electrical motor things, or perhaps even electronic control module. Sign of times and designs - 10 cent capacitor or resistor fails on a small circuit board and you get full-blown $500 repair.  Nothing is simple today - it used to be, you shut the door, spring latch engaged mechanically. Today when I close my car (without locking, just shut the last door or hatch), I can often hear several motors engaging for one-two seconds. This of course means those are candidades for parts that could fail sooner than later. I can only hope it's not a start of all other electronic/electrical components going. Will see - if I get one of those every two years, I'd be allright. On the other hand, if I have to visit dealerships more frequently from now for those kinds of problems, I'll have to think about what's next. The electronics are wonderful inventions that made our lifes easier in many places, but it seems we are now relying on them in so many places for sometimes inexplicable reasons. Simple door latch is now some electronic module with motor and circuitry attached. All of that has lifespan much more limited than those traditional locks and we all pay for it sooner or later. What's worse, the repair people are not handy enough to change those 10 cent parts (that actually failed), they make buy entire assembly costing hundreds - and you can't do anything about it, as when those electronic controls fail, they can't be simply overriden by a switch.

I'm not sure how many take place later as it seems so many of them are leased and you don't hear much from the people that buy them used. Makes one wonder if actually kept past warranty? I realize that the fixes are cheap(warranty) but time is also money. I had a 10 year old Infiniti that never had a bulb or a motor fixed or replaced. I currently have a 10 year old Toyota pickup that also has never had a bulb or motor fixed or replaced. We also have a 6 year old with Mazda that has never had a motor fixed or replaced and it just went over 103k miles. However, I just replaced a halogen headlight last week on the Mazda for a grand total of $8.99 and about 10 minutes of my labor.  I just had my first service(oil change/rotation) on my new Acura and it is the first time I've been back to the dealer in a year except for a class on how to use all the tech stuff. I have to wonder if it's just the lack of quality of the motors, latches and switches that the German brands use versus the Japanese brands. I would find it hard to believe that it could be attributable to the actual manufacturing process in the German plants as I've spent quite a bit of time in Germany and know how exact they can be. I also wonder if the the U.S. made BMWs use different suppliers for those items(I assume they probably do) and if there are substantially less problems in those areas on the U.s. made vs. the German made vehicles. Just curious I guess. Based on all the reports(not just in this forum) of electrical bugaboos in the German brands it seems they could do a better job of sourcing parts if a $20k midsize Japanese brand car can have better electrical parts than a $50k ELLPS. I read something once that blamed many of these electrical gremlins on cheap Eastern Euro electrical parts that VW was sourcing but really can't substantiate that.

I think it's more about attitude and cost controls. Relays, electrical items have certain lifetime designed into them (say X hours). One rated for half of those hours can cost one tenth of the price - and it looks just the same. It becomes irresistible for them to try, especially that chances are, majority will work for much longer. That rating may come from statistical sampling that certain percentage will meet the time criteria and to achieve same percentage of the the longer time, manufacturing process would have to be redesigned, making part that much more expensive. Cost-benefit for manufacturer becomes such that it's cheaper to deal with higher percentage repairs than pay for one that lasts. Why Germans do that and Japanese stick to better quality? This may have to do with cost of labor. There is only so much you can do to add efficiency. German labor is simply most expensive, not just due to wages, but also additional costs, from social security, to taxes, to benefits. Only so much can be paid out of customer's money, before they refuse.  Bear also in mind that Mercedes Benz or BMW used to be trully exclusive brands, only for trully rich. They all have ambitions to sell more and more cars. Those cars are sold in milions. They may be ""premium"", but they are far cry from those 600 SEL from 60s or 70s in terms of cost and reach.

That said, when I owned my BMW, the oil changes were ""whenever the indicator for an oil change comes one, or one year, whichever comes first"".  I remember hearing of people who were going as much as 17K between oil changes because the oil change indicator never came on.  Don't remember when BMW started doing ""free maintenance"" with loooonnng deltas between oil changes. But, I would think by now, there would be some evidence that they were detrimental. I haven't heard any complaints, though."
4771,"October 16, 2013  2:57PM",dino001,"I don't know - these 2.0 turbos are still only 3 years in service, it is possible that they got some statistically significant results prompting them to shorten the mileage between changes. It wouldn't be visible from an average person's view (his nearest dealer's garage), as not many of those engines reached 100K miles yet, but from corporate view they might be seing emerging patterns for those subsamples of the long mileage engines across the world. Just saying, it's possible.  If you are right, it would mean BMW gave into paying dealers more, as first 50K miles is on their dime. Not sure why they'd do that - perhaps it was a dealer apeasement move to give them potentially one more BMW-paid changes. 15K+ miles per year would generate four BMW-paid oil changes per 50K/4 year initial warranty period, instead of three, but it would create a justification for more visits after the period ended. It may not be high price to pay for dealer's happyness.  On other comments, I hear exactly what you are saying. US-based traditional maintenance periods and recommendations (proverbial Jiffy Lube/Joe's Chevy 3 thousand miles on ""severe schedule"") are RIDICULOUS. They were developed during old ""dyno"" oil times for engines that were not very well made. As you said, it is very common to see 25K-30K kilometer (15-20K miles) maintenance periods in Europe, even for lowly Toyotas and Fords, often having same/similar engines to those used here. There are differences, though - European practice is ""come not very often, but leave a lot of money at each visit and do as we say or else (including exact oil brands and grades) and to maintain warranty you HAVE TO do it with us"". American practice has been ""come as often as we tell you, but we will charge you relatively small amount of money and use substandard materials, but there is no harm because you change it so often"". It's evolving, as manufacturers have stretched those periods here, but as you said yourself - not nearly as much as across the Pond, because dealers wouldn't have it. BTW, one difference is, European authorized service stations are not necessarily attached to sales dealerships - they sometimes function as separate franchises, which here is almost unheard of. This gives manufacturers better leverage there to divide constituancies and play them separately."
4772,"October 16, 2013  2:59PM",dino001,"I think is was around early to mid 2000s. There was definitely a coincidence between increasing the period and instituting ""free"" maintenance."
4773,"October 16, 2013  6:51PM",markcincinnati,"Another tidbit to perhaps put someone's mind at ease: the amount of oil that the European cars require at a change is sometimes close to double the oil amount a Japanese ""premium"" car requires.  When I had my Acura, I used to take the oil with me for the oil changes -- I would take a 5-quart container of Mobil 1 or some other name brand 100% synthetic oil -- after the change there would still be oil left in the container.  My wife's X3, for example, however, would take 8+ quarts for an oil change. I am assuming you can safely go further on oil that is less dirty. The more oil capacity the car has the more dirty oil it can handle -- no wonder Infiniti, etc, expects oil change intervals of 3,750 miles -- their cars don't hold much oil.  Also the Euro cars require synthetic oil, the Japanese cars do not. I assume American cars, for the most part, fall into the no synthetic oil policy, too.  Oil is better now -- than then. Engines (at least of Euro cars) are better now than ever. Oil change intervals of 10, 15 even 20K miles are probably not an issue for cars with well made and well lubricated engines. :surprise:  Drive it like you live."

The last one was the only one I remember having free 4 year maintenance. So, you're probably right Dino.  Mark....I concur that engines are made more prcisely these days. Plus, it's much easire to measure the fluid effectiveness with the amount of computers on board. Plus, fluids (not just oil) are much better today than they were. Case in point, the use of synthetics.  That said, I remember when Mobil 1 first hit the market. Their initial claim to fame was ""no oil changes needed except for 10,000 mile intervals"".  At least BMW is surpassing that now.  My Audi takes 10K oil change intervals."

I don't know why Infiniti has such an aggressive oil change schedule but not all Japanese luxury cars(I noticed your slight but won't go there) are like that. Your TL certainly didn't require them that often did it? My Acura just had it's first oil change at 7200 miles and the oil monitor was on 30% oil life remaining. I had it changed because it was at the one year mark. I guess it could have went to 9k or so before the oil life monitor would have indicated an oil change and probably more if I did a lot more freeway driving."

Now to answer your question: Infiniti dealers use old-school mineral oil on those still fairly modern engines. For those not to sludge, I suspect you need to have keep this oil new and change it often. I guess the pact is come often, pay small entrance fee (for the oil change) and we will find four opportunities per year to pick your pocket on something else we will ""find"" or invent. I feel that if Infiniti suddenly changed the schedule to once per year good quality synthetic, the dealers would lose all those revenue upsell opportunities."

Now, on notion of ""aggressive"" vs. ""conservative"": I wrote that because it is well established in many different professional communities across the board (engineering, finances, accounting, etc.) that ""aggressive"" is usually associated with pushing the envelope of established limits, or even going beyond them. ""Conservative"" is used for practice that is well inside of such limits. In those terms, Infiniti's schedule does not push any limits, it's well within established limits of that community, from Jiffy Lube to Bob's Chevy, driving 3K/3M schedule ad naseam. On the other hand, BMW's schedule pushes the envelope, thus would be called aggressive."

I've been a 3,000 to 4,000 mile oil change type guy, but have never used synthetic oil. Volvo provides the first 5 oil changes, per their schedule, at their expense. So when I took mine in at 5,000 miles for a change on my dime, the tech thought I was nuts. Someone else who I consider knowledgeable in this area said I'm wasting money and resources. I did have the oil changed again at 10,000 miles, free. I've recently come to the conclusion that I will have the oil changed at every 10,000 miles.

Best part, which I really loved (NOT), he printed out a sheet with those three bargain priced ($200 each) services with statement like ""customer requests x service"". Wow, there is no shame in this world. No, customer does NOT request x service.  BTW, those ""recommendations"" were so ridiculous (power steering fluid change and injector cleaning - at 15,000 miles!) that even he didn't have much of a conviction to selling them. He moved immediately into ""from those three you really need only this one"", which was a bargain-priced alignment at $200. I told him, well, as much as I actually may agree with you on this one, I won't do it at your price. Got one done at $125 by a specialised independent garage. In the process I learned that BMW's alignment is not so easy - tire stores, so eager to sell you one, usually at aroun $70-$80, wouldn't even touch my car. Something to do with electronics. So I'm not surprised the dealer wants $200. If there is no big competition, why not charge arm an leg.

4789,"October 18, 2013  3:15PM",alltorque,"Volvo S60 T5 in Europe is oil change at 18,000 miles or 1 year, whichever comes first. This assumes correct viscosity and spec. Engines are same on both continents. Volvo oil specs are universal I believe, (SAE 0w-30, ACEA A5/B5), so.................it's all to do with greed and nothing to do with oil quality or engine life. 10,000 mile changes in Europe would be cause for rioting in the streets. Even using ACEA A1/B1 poverty spec it's 12,000 miles. Same old same old.  I've been running my '06 S60 D5 (185bhp turbodiesel), on correct Volvo oil - as above - and yearly changes and at 94,000 miles, (first year was only 5,000 miles as it was a Volvo UK staff car), it's just getting better; no smoke, good consumption, no oil burn and pulls like a train. What more can I say ?  Have a look at the recommendation chart here. Basic engines are still the same but some ancillaries may have changed and later engines have more power due to better chipping. For a modest sum Volvo will re-chip my D5 from 185bhp to 205bhp to match current version.  http://www.volvoclub.org.uk/oil_school.shtml"
4790,"October 18, 2013  3:29PM",dino001,"I agree, but there is another side of this. It is much easier to get a warranty honored in the US than in Europe, not just with cars, anything manufactured. The manufacturers find many inventive ways to walk away from their obligations with impunity over there. I found there is also much more goodwill here as well (major repairs after warranty with manufacturer's cost participation). One can say the goodwill is ""prepaid"" in those short intervals."
4791,"October 18, 2013  8:22PM",markcincinnati,"It seems that Audi, BMW and soon Volvo (among other Euro brands) are quickly becoming car companies that motivate virtually all of their cars with some form of a forced induction engine. Turbo charging seems to be the go-to forced induction technology. Audi and Mercedes use superchargers in some applications -- but the majority of the Euro brands (and also starting to show up in non-Euro brands, to be sure) are not naturally aspirated any more.  It is my understanding -- and I certainly could be misinformed -- that forced induction engines need to have their oil changed more frequently than non forced induction engines. The reason, I believe, is heat and dirt -- and in the case of turbos, the very high speeds at which the impellers spin.  It is indeed impressive that these engines, when equipped with large oil tanks and with ever improving oil filtration, can go often a MINIMUM of 10K miles between changes. I do think, however, that there is still no harm in changing the oil by 15K miles, no matter what the on-board computer says. My wife's 2008 X3 engine computer wouldn't let on that it wanted an oil change until 18K miles had passed. At that time, that just seemed crazy to me -- but I was OK with 15K miles.  Another thing these Premium (ELLPS) cars seem to require (disobey at your own peril) is a ""top-tier gasoline"" meaning that the gasoline has cleaning additives 5X more than is ""required"" and so forth. When my sales rep gave me the keys to my 2014 S4 he actually said ""use a top-tier"" gasoline (your fuel injectors will thank you.) Of course, I always try to use this type of fuel.  DILYL"

I let the EGT drop to300 degrees or lower before I shut down (and it often took 2 - 5 minutes) -- prevents coking, among other things. It's not often that a mechanical engineer ends up being a truck driver, but when it happens things can be learned.  It'll be very interesting to see how car turbos respond, long-term, to the hands-off, ignorant operation & maintenance practices of the American public. These are the people who can't be troubled to use directional signals, so they're likely to come off an uphill run on the freeway, park and turn the car off immediately. It'll be a hide-and-watch moment.  That said, oil change intervals for a turbo engine certainly need to be shorter than for NA engines. Whether the manufacturers agree remains to be seen."

4796,"October 19, 2013  6:06PM",alltorque,"Read my above post ref Volvo S60 turbodiesel oil changes. Whilst (relatively) small turbo engines may be fairly new to USA, at least in volume terms, they have been around in Europe and Japan for quite some time; particularly the diesel variety. Oil change intervals of 18,000 to 20,000 miles are not at all unusual from the major manufacturers and these engines seem to go on forever. Of course, abused turbos, (i.e. not allowing a cooling-down period. After a period of high revs a gentle amble around urban roads of 2 - 3 miles will suffice or a 2 min+ idle), will fail sooner than is considered normal.  To take advantage of their tax laws, Japanese manufacturers have used 660 - 695cc turbo gasoline engines, (yes, 0.7 litre), that are real screamers and some have made it to Europe in more mainstream cars.  Here in Europe, VW Group have been selling the VW Polo GTi and Skoda Fabia vRS small hatchbacks that have their 1.4 TSI engine which is both turbo- and super-charged to give 170bhp and 250Nm, mated to a 7-spd DSG 'box. Fun little devices. Despite being reasonably highly rated, these engines have official oil change intervals of 1 year or 15,000 miles.........same as the overall service schedule. You have to use the correct spec oil, though. But let's be fair, lube oil is the cheapest component in the car; and one of the most important. To be fair, there were reported software problems with some of the early engines which could cause misfires and potential piston damage but AFAIK that is no longer an issue.  So, there is no reason that turbo- engines should be saddled with lower oil change intervals - the experience already exists over many years. Unless, of course, it's driven by dealer financial considerations."

4815,"October 10, 2013  7:39PM",andres3,"Agreed; Audi allows you to pick ala cart items from the ""PRESTIGE"" package with the ""Premium Plus"" package, therefore making the PRESTIGE package pointless unless you like every item it includes.  Acura lost points on this count. I absolutely adore the sound system, but $3K to even 3.5K extra didn't make sense to me. Why is the good leather combined with the sound system ""tech"" package anyway? Most of that cost is in the Navigation which can be had for $100 in a portable unit."

I like that I can go to any car under the awning's and take it without a problem. Lately there has been some interesting cars, I just had a Volvo XC60, as well as S60.

I think you and I must have the only Ibis White S4s in the entire Cincinnati area....as I've never seen a duplicate of mine. You'll find mine cruising around the Liberty, West Chester, Fairfield, Butler County area.  CTS-V for $60K? 410 HP from a twin turbo? Hmmmmm......still, it's a Cadillac, and all the good, and the not so good, that comes with that.  I shouldn't let my prejudices clould stand in the way of a new car:D  FN....I'm not traveling until after Thanksgiving (first time for that in a loooooonng time). I'll have to make it a point to try National when I'm back on the road. Thx!"
4818,"October 11, 2013  6:57PM",fedlawman,"For $60K I would find a CPO BMW M5. Then Id go trolling for Corvettes and 911's :P  Seriously though, the S4 is a very sweet car. Congrats!"
4819,"October 11, 2013  7:52PM",markcincinnati,"I've now spent a bit of time ""initializing"" the S4's MMI system parameters -- including Audi Connect (free for 6-months). In terms of ease of use, the MMI user interface remains super easy, one could argue it is almost intuitive. What I do notice, this time, in comparison to my 2009 A4 Prestige, is that there seems to be more that can be configured via the MMI. I had to chuckle when I pressed the CAR button and was presented with the ability to set my INDIVIDUAL preferences and one of them pertained to the engine/exhaust sound: ""Comfort,"" ""Auto,"" or ""Dynamic."" This option must be there simply ""because they could."" I guess when your car stickers at north of $56K, you need to be able to rule your domain, so to speak.  I do appreciate the new (to me) ability to speak entire phone numbers and entire addresses without having to spell things out or use the rotary knob to dial in o-n-e l-e-t-t-e-r a-t a t-i-m-e. Big move forward in voice recognition. Pairing my iPhone 5, too, was a snap -- but, there is no easy way to use the iPhone (other than Bluetooth) since the supplied cable is only good for iPhone's up to the 4S models. That is one thing Acura did a better job of: media connectivity. I mean, you could use a USB or a mini-stereo (male) plug or Bluetooth or all three at the same time.  Audi uses its own proprietary cable and you can't have your iPhone set up for two functions: one Bluetooth and one hardwired ""connection"" are not supported. My primary reason for not using Bluetooth has been I wanted to keep the phone in charge mode while I was driving, and the Acura allowed just that by plugging one end of the cable into the iPhone and one end into a female USB which charged the iPhone and allowed both iPod and Phone functions to operate without first shutting one down to use the other.  It is a small thing -- but sometimes it just makes one wonder why they can produce such a technologically advanced vehicle but overlook what most of us have come to expect in a plug''n'-play world.  Another cool feature -- but one that is NOT worth $30/month after the 6 month free trial ends -- is Audi connect that will actually show google earth pictures on the nav screen -- in excellent clarity. Not sure why I'd pay for that. Now, I know the stated ""value"" of Audi connect is that it turns the interior of the S4 into a WiFi hotspot -- but here's the thing, the ONLY carrier offered is T-Mobile and the signal is restricted to 3G. Those of you with the outdated Apple iPhone 5 know that your phone can be made into a WiFi hot spot (and that is just a ""standard"" feature of the iPhone); but, the difference is, depending on your carrier, I suppose, the iPhone can be 4G LTE, which would make someone's laptop using your iPhone WiFi hotspot run faster. Yes, the Audi Connect is more than a WiFi hotspot enabler, but, really, if I needed a hotspot while driving, the iPhone works well and you can buy a hell of a lot of ""band"" for an extra $30 per month.  I guess I look at Audi Connect as a too expensive technology considering its data fees. If my mind changes, I'll report back to you.  OK, once you get all (or most) of the MMI options set the way YOU want them, you're ready to punch the start button and -- finally -- take this sublime machine out on the road.  I set my Audi Drive Select to dynamic and put the S-Tronic in D (which becomes ""S"" when set to dynamic via the MMI) and pulled out of the driveway.  The power that is available underfoot is hard to describe -- I am tempted to hyperventilate and gush ""the power feels limitless,"" which it does, but I won't, for I know someone, somewhere will point out a quicker, stronger and even more capable vehicle. For the life of me, though, when I read (or watch on YouTube) the test reports and see 0-60 in 4.4 seconds as the tested performance, I now understand how quickly the S4 reaches speed without muss nor fuss and without my even noticing it. Its ""pick up"" is so quick AND so smooth, it cautions me to watch the gauges since there are few signals of how quickly speed rises (and I am cautioned by the local long arm of the law, too).  Braking, too, makes me now think I understand how landing on an aircraft carrier must feel -- the brakes shed speed with incredible -- ""you've got to feel it to believe it"" -- aplomb.  My 2009 A4 was a quiet car to ride in -- not compared to the 2014 S4, though. The S4 almost makes me believe there might be some actual practical purpose to the MMI setting governing engine/exhaust sound -- you might need to hear something to clue you in just how quickly you got to extra-legal speeds. Lord knows there isn't much in the way of an audible cue to give you a sense of velocity.  Speaking of sound -- the Acura TL (Advance) has, to this day, not been bettered in terms of the sound system Acura blesses it [the TL Advance] with -- the B&O sound system in the S4 is ""cleaner and clearer"" than my fading memory of my 2009 A4 B&O. Nothing, so far, come close to the sound of a DVD-audio recording (or a DTS disc, for that matter), but the current iteration of the B&O system is a welcome improvement. The HD radio as well as SiriusXM probably sound as good as these technologies (and transmission limitations) can deliver, so I'll simply suggest checking off the B&O option box should you choose Audi from the ELLPS list.  With such green tires it is difficult to say anything about the ""handling"" of the S4 -- since it will surely improve over the next few days as the ""green-ness"" of the tires is scrubbed away. By the way, I chose (of my own free will) to get the 18"" UHP A/S tires instead of the MAX Perf Summer-only rubber. I live in Cincinnati for pity's sake -- the freeways are crowded (so what good is a 155 mph limiter?) and we do have moderate winters with a couple of days of snow cover here and there -- besides, the summer rubber Audi chooses really has a short tread life in my experience. I'll live (in shame) with a 130 mph limiter in other words.  That's it for now.  I'll close and wonder why (considering the price and the ""natural comparison"") the S4 was not thrown in the mix of cars that were compared to the new Lexus IS F Sport. I would think the S4 might have given the judges pause. We'll see, maybe next time.  DILYL"
4820,"October 12, 2013  1:25PM",graphicguy,"Mark...glad you're enjoying the S4. I agree with everything you say. The Audi connect wasn't worth it to me, either. In addition, during the trial, it was painfully slow.  I leave everything in dynamic mode most of the time, except if I'm on a long interstate jaunt. I use comfort settings, then. I got the all season tires, too. I really had no use for the 155 MPH summer only tires.  I agree about the stereo, too. The B&O is good, but the TL ELS stereo is the best I've heard in any car, at any price.  As you know, it's really nice around the OH Valley right now. But, when we hit those mid 90s next summer, you'll find the A/C to be frigid.  Get out there today and hit the road...enjoy the ride. Personally, we're headed to the saurkraut festival in Waynesville today."
4821,"October 12, 2013  7:07PM",dino001,"Just attended my dealer's model introduction event. Not a very good one - they simply grabed first available salesman and gave me their standard test drive. The only difference between the ""event"" and standard day at the office was they had vehicles lined up and ready, so no time lost in searching. And fancy appetizers, and small gift. Not really comparable to those manufacturer's events.  Anyway, I got a chance for first drive in 328 GT and diesel. First was 328 GT. I was prepared for much worse when it comes to GT, but it drove OK. Longer wheelbase increased the turn radius, but that's the price for room. Steering wheel feel is equally dreadful in small speeds, as one in standard 3-series, but it's not much worse. High speeds feel similar. Car is good for cruising and commute, but certainly not for track - but it was clearly not built for that. The biggest thing is BMW reportedly redesigned start/stop system, engine hardware and software. The engine is noticeably smoother and start/stop works better. Car no longer shakes at restart. This was done for all July and later production day cars.  Next was diesel, 328d. It is same as 320d in Europe, but they changed name, because americans would not pay premium for ""economy"" name. Think 320i vs 328i. 328d is more than 328i, if they called it 320d they'd sell half of those. it is clearly long distance car. Pleasant, quick enough, but not as fast even as 328i. But it doesn't need to be. I think it may be a decent offset for the fuel economy, as long as it delivers on those mpg numbers on the sticker. I'm not a diesel fanatic, but it may just be first time I see a real diesel product that may stick. Not some crazy fast machine for God knows how much, like previous 335d. This one has a chance to be a left brain choice, all things considered.  The salesguy was pleasant and no pressure, cause this was an ""event"". We had a nice chat about other improvements BMW made, such as voice recognition, map search, etc. I say they better, because mine are pretty useless. I'm sure other manufacturers make similar strides. I just hope they'll fix the steering, put more feedback, even if it's through fake software. I just hate that buickey feel."
4822,"October 13, 2013  1:51PM",dino001,"Seems they are recognizing their prices went bonkers. There seem to be ongoing cash incentive for a few months now, they call it option allowance. It even applies to newly released 2014 versions, like diesel, or GT. They can call it whatever, bottom line they used to have cash incentives only during model switchovers, seems now it's on everything. They should be careful, as it's very difficult to turn off cash incentive mill. They may be thinking it's better to give people a deal than lower price, but I don't know. Brand dilution is usually more pronounced when sold on X off basis than when retail price goes down. Anyway, I predict free leather may come much sooner than on previous platform."
4823,"October 14, 2013  2:03PM",graphicguy,"dino....BMW has always seemed to be more focused on leasing. As such, they've often subidized their leases pretty heavily.  But, that's assuming the high MSRP prices don't scare away potential buyers from even walking into their showroom with no knowledge of BMW incentives.  I think most of us potential customers posting here are right in BMW's wheel house. And, we're thinking twice (except for FN's new purchase) about walking into their showroom.  Still, I guess they're doing well with that strategy, as they seem to be doing well."
4824,"October 14, 2013  2:41PM",markcincinnati,"Well take a look at the new Cadillac CTS Vsport pricing -- $59K+ base, $60K+ nicely equipped.  I find myself wondering if we may be approaching a time when cars can be updated for years after purchase -- the prices seem to be getting beyond the reach of more and more people. My friend has an airplane that he just keeps updating this that and the other thing on -- says it beats buying a new one.  If they'er going to be so transitory (cars that is), they ought to be priced as such.  Not gonna happen in my lifetime, I'll bet.  Of course, perhaps cars are things that people should always rent and always be making payments on (and always having fairly new ones).  DILYL"
4825,"October 14, 2013  2:46PM",dino001,"Yeah, I know. I don't fit that crowd. Even if I bought things with short term in mind, I never found a lease I liked - at least so far. It was mostly because those models I got DID NOT have as good lease incentives, as those volume models. Converted money factors were higher than purchase interest rates, even before rolling in lease fees, and residual is only slightly inflated, which was the case for my current wagon. Basically the deal would have been nothing to write home about, so why would I lease? My previous cars were Subarus and those guys don't inflate residuals at all - in fact STI I bought in 2008 had a very bad residual when compared with what I could actually sell it for after three years. But 2011/2012 was abnormal, as tsunami crippled the Subaru's supply and inflated the their used car prices, which I think is the case even until today.  Bottom line, lease doesn't work for my favorite models, at least never has so far - that's why I look at the actual prices. And those are bonkers on new 3-series: 328 easy over $50K, 335 easy high $50s, sometimes over $60K, if you like ""stuff"". It is at least 5 grand higher than just a few years ago, on the sticker anyway. The cash incentives have to roll out on that. I wonder where it will go, hope they won't evolve to old ""the Cadillac way"", where price on the sticker meant absolutely nothing."

4828,"October 16, 2013 12:34PM",dino001,"I just discovered something that does not make me feel that great. BMW changed their paid maintenance period for new cars to 12K miles/12 months, from previously 16K miles/12 months. This means they either had too much resistance from their dealer base (this would not be such a big problem), or discovered that the oil simply doesn't last as they originally thought/claimed (this obviously is a big issue). What about existing customers, those who bought in last few years and sticked to the computer recommended schedule? I'm not very happy. Seems like those who warned about this being an issue are now validated. The only consolation I can think of is that my commute is at least 75% highway, if not more and my engine is naturally aspirated vs. current BMW lineup is all turbocharged. From my previous turbo owning times (had two Subarus with such engines), I know they tend to go through oil faster than naturally aspirated engines (turbos spin at 5-10 times engine spin). I may be OK long term and no damage done, but it does not make me happy to think BMW was either too cheap or too arrogant in thinking that they can get away with those long periods.  I'm going to call my dealer to ask about this. Not a happy camper."
4829,"October 16, 2013  1:18PM",alltorque,"Would be very surprised if this was an oil-capability issue. It is almost certainly a dealer/revenue-driven issue.  Don't have a BMW but a neighbour has a 320i. The service indicator, when reset after the annual service just tells him that next service is due in 1 year or 18000 or so miles. I doubt anything has changed for 2014............same oil and no huge incidence of failed engines.  America has traded on ridiculously short oil-drain intervals for year. Lube oil was low cost so no issue. Not so here in Europe.  My '06 Volvo S60 D5 has an oil change interval of 1 year or 18,000 miles. Doesn't burn any between changes and is in top form with a mere 94,000 miles on it, (just about run-in my dealer reckons :-)).  Some years ago I was working here in Europe with a senior guy from the USA lubes division of the oil major we both worked for. He got all excited one day about America announcing that their oil would now run to 10,000 mile oil changes.............but for gasoline engines only. I was driving a VW Group diesel at the time, (A Skoda Fabia vRS with the 130bhp 1.9TDi PD). He was devastated to hear that the standard oil drain for that engine was 10,000 miles..............in Europe. Most VW engines, incl diesels are now 20,000 mile drains.  The BMW change is not oil/engine driven but - in my experienced opinion - cost/dealer greed-driven. America has been mis-informed for years on oil change intervals."

4835,"October  4, 2013  6:25PM",markcincinnati,"I don't know if I posted that my wife ordered a 2014 Q5 3.0T P+ with the sport interior, nav, B&O, blind spot monitoring, etc. Thing is, as is her ""policy"" we test drive the crap outta anything she is even remotely serious about. Once she had it down to the Q5, it was a matter of ""which engine?""  We drove the slightly HP (+9) up-rated 2014 2.0T with the 8-spd tiptronic; then the 3.0T also with the 8-spd (of course, since that is all that is offered) then the 2.0T and so on.  I decided I really liked the ""detuned"" S4 engine enough to rule out even an all sported up A4 2.0T S-Line -- meaning a new IS 350 F Sport AWD was the only way to go. At the time, I knew I was not worthy of an S4 -- and besides, they were in a whole 'nother price class.  So, I configured the IS, got a ""no strings attached"" order placed (apparently none exist with the uprated sound system -- they have to be ordered?!) :confuse: And was prepped to wait 120 days. Mean time back in Audi-ville, the new 3.0T Q5 production reports started coming in -- we even got the arrival date and got the Audi dealer to take the 2011 Infiniti FX35 off of my wife's hands about 5 months ahead of the lease termination.  The Audi dealer is a sweet-heart (due to our lengthy history with Audi and the dealership) and a couple of weeks ago, the sales rep sent me an email offering test drives of an A5 2.0T (with sport suspension) and an S-Tronic S4 (which I had already tested and was smitten by).  To make a long story short, my membership in the Audi Club got me an immediate 6% off of the sticker of a new Audi and *BONUS* got my wife a $1,000 loyalty bonus on her inbound 3.0T Q5.  It was like watching the Exorcist 128 times in a row -- ""It got better and better every time.""  So, I said, get me a new S4 in Ibis white (a no charge paint color) and nav and B&O and blind spot monitoring and I'm there.  No wait.  Get me one, like the above but with the Magma Red Leather interior and carbon fiber inlays.  There's one in the US (in NY) and none on a boat. Never mind, I'll order one.  Days later -- email dings: The NY car is yours.  It is being trucked from NY to Cincinnati practically as we speak.  Hmm an S4 vs an IS 350 F Sport? The S-Tronic transmission (DSG) is worth the price of admission and the supercharged engine is, well, incredible and, all things considered, economical. Put the thing in dynamic mode and it is a four-door hot rod. Keep it in comfort mode and it is just south of a full-on LPS.  I've never had a red interior -- but the pictures of the leather and the contrast with the white exterior seem, er, almost tasteful.  I'm starting to feel more worthy. :surprise:  Good bye Acura TL, good bye.  DILYL"

4837,"October  4, 2013  7:46PM",markcincinnati,"I believe you are right. When I started out, pre Audi Club discount, the dealer offered 5% off. The ACNA certificate bumped it up to 6%. The dealer discounted the Q5 MORE than 6%, so the ACNA discount wasn't the best deal.  My wife ordered the Q5 in Curvee Silver with the Chestnut brown sport interior giving her sport seats (ahhhhhh) and the three spoke steering wheel with paddle shifters.  Funny thing, the S4 S-Tronic has paddle shifters but the car is smarter than most people (like me), so you're better off leaving the S-Tronic to its own devices. The 8-speed tiptronic, however, only comes with paddle shifters if you get the sport interior (which is rare), and the 8-speed benefits from them.  Here's one that puzzles me: why not market an A4 with the same engine as the Q5 3.0T (a detuned S4 supercharged affair good for 295 ft pounds of torque)?  I haven't had a speeding ticket in almost 20 years -- gulp! The S4 could easily break that streak.

One question, I was not aware that you can get any other color interior than black with the sport package, every time I built an Audi on line and choose the sport back, the interior would default to black glad to know this isn't the case, Rick has been looking at a Q5 on line..  Now, talking about new cars.... A couple of weeks back I had started talking with the BMW dealer about a purchase of a 320i. Then Rick and I took off for New England and NYC for a week, on my return we continued to talk more, so Friday, I went to the dealership and finalized the deal. It is Jet Black, Beige Leather with Premium Package, 8spd auto. I made out pretty good, 2K built Credit, 750 returning BMW owner, 500 USAA , and 1K graduate money. I used the Costco purchase agreement, which gave me the car $750 over invoice, when it was all said and done, OTD price was $35,275. I took the BMW select financing for 4 years. It was nice to walk out with zero out of pocket. I didn't want to lease the car as my payment would have been higher, and Rick would be using the car while I'm at work.  Drove the car up to Sedona that evening, on this trip up and back averaged 33.6 not bad for a car with 47 miles when starting off. Speed was between 55 to 90, the higher speed was not intentional the car doesn't feel the speed as in my past BMWs. I wish I had the BMW Assist but over on BimmerFest it seem that it can be added to the car.  I have to say, I really like the car, yes, it has elec steering, but the only time you really know it is when you really push the car, and on city streets one doesn't get to that limit.

4849,"October  7, 2013  1:18PM",markcincinnati,"Both my wife's Q5 and my S4 came (or will come) from Greg @ the Audi Connection. My wife's 2011 FX35 also came from another Joseph dealership, Infiniti of Cincinnati.  Dealing with these folks has always been a pleasure -- and the Audi Club membership helped with the price (on the S4). Service departments at both Audi and Infiniti have been great, too.  We went ahead and got the Audi Care mntce programs -- something missed on both the Acura and the Infiniti. The premium cars we have had experience with are always very pricey to maintain -- even the Infiniti. On the other hand, the service departments at Acura, Audi, BMW and Infiniti have always been delightful in terms of giving customers the red carpet treatment.  We bought the Q5 and leased the S4. Don't laugh, but we have NEVER purchased a car -- it is scary, since we have always felt that houses should be purchased and cars should be rented.  Those folks who have never leased, probably don't get why we have some fear and trepidation about buying. I guess it is like getting married vs living together. Buying seems like a commitment, leasing not so much. Cars however are transitory, ephemeral -- so, to us buying is a scary proposition.  Now the Q5, based on its anticipated depreciation, is not as much of a financial risk as many cars are.  We'll let you know how this venture into this new experience works out.  DILYL"

That was 2004.  Funny thing is I think my Condo out-depreciated my car in CA.  Of course, a home can last you 100 years (you could depreciate the purchase over 100 years), and the car perhaps only 10-15 years."
4852,"October  7, 2013  5:47PM",billyperksii,"Mark I have to ask you this (not that I am getting personal), but dont you have around 18 months left on your TL lease? Are you that unsatisfied with the car that you are willing to eat those 18 months of payments?  Secondly, I disagree with your concepts of leasing/buying cars, I will not get into the nuts and bolts of it- I just disagree."
4853,"October  7, 2013  6:31PM",markcincinnati,"The situation with the TL is that I have 10 months left on the lease. At the lease's conclusion, my mileage situation means I would owe about $5,000 to walk away from Acura. Acura, unlike Infiniti, doesn't allow you to buy miles at lease inception at a discount. My wife bought 18K miles per year on her lease, I couldn't do that.  My TL is an SH-AWD advance -- and, after detailing it last week, it looks nearly new. Using three web-sites, plus CarFAX, I was able to determine that to abandon my lease will cost less than $2K today.  So I am going to be ding'd -- a little now vs a lot then. My plan, at this point is to consider buying the S4 off lease (I will have first right of refusal) with a CPO warranty and Audi Care to 100,000 miles. Audi does allow the purchase of additional miles after lease inception, but before the last 6 months of the lease.  As noted, we're thinking buying should not be completely discounted -- so we're taking the buy one rent one (and possibly buy later) approach since we've no experience with buying a car and find the concept almost foreign.  So, yep terminating the lease early will cost me, but not nearly as much as going to full term.  Your mileage may differ.  DILYL"

4859,"October  7, 2013 10:04PM",markcincinnati,"The Audi Prestige and Acura Advance pose at least one question I intellectually understand but ""just don't seem right!""  The Prestige and Advance ""configurations"" from Audi and Acura seem to me to be a way to bundle virtually ""everything"" into one package. Indeed, the Acura Advance has no options that can be had, the Advance (over the technology package version) adds 19"" wheels, heated and ventilated seats and blind spot monitoring.  The Prestige Audi adds a number of extras (on top of the next lower configuration, Premium+) and seems to offer the buyer a slightly better deal when purchased as part of the Prestige package. Although in the case of Audi, it is possible to add most of the Prestige features (for extra cost, of course) to the Premium+. In other words, if you wanted blind spot monitoring, you can tick off that option on a Premium+ version for $500 and NOT get the navigation system which comes standard with the Prestige version.  OK, now that I have tap danced around your question, I'll mention that the top of the line configurations have lower residuals than the ""middle children.""  We configured my wife's Q5 and my S4 by building up Premium+ models to have most of the Prestige's features which actually means that our residual % on Premium+ is higher than the maxed out contented Prestige models.  You may wonder why we researched the residual of the Q5 since we are buying it -- but the reason to know the residual has to do with knowing at least the possible value of the depreciating asset at various times during the financing contract. In other words, knowing the ""residual"" does allow us to have an understanding of when the car is no longer upside down. With the S4, the residual is important for obvious reasons, since it is leased. The S4 P+ has an attractive residual indeed which is, of course, a double edged sword.  The higher residual lowers the mo/pay but also raises the cost of buying the car off lease should we decide to go that route.  Now to answer your question:  My 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD Advance has a % residual $ amt = $24,509.85.  The MSRP was = $47,166.30. ~52% residual in other words.  DILYL"

Since I'm new to the premium market I can't tell you if the CLA interior is the same as or worse than anything else in the lineup.
4862,"October  1, 2013  1:54PM",graphicguy,"Michaell...thanks for the update. I'm mildly interested in the CLA. But, from a sports sedan perspective, my antenna tell me it's going to fall short. I've never really been a fan of MB interiors, either.  That said, there are those who love the styling of the CLA...especially given its 3/4 of a CLS type of view.  NY....I'm trying hard to like the Q50. Granted, I haven't driven one, yet. But, I'm not even luke warm about the styling. Now, that they've softened it up (as all the trade rags state), I can't find a reason to visit an Infiniti showroom....maybe as a curiosity, but little more.  All of that is personal preference, however. I'm sure Infiniti will be OK, as will Mercedes. As much as the CLA trails its competition in the performance dept, they'll sell every one they can get their hands on because it has a Mercedes logo on the front."
4863,"October  1, 2013  3:42PM",Michaell,"gg - with your past experience with the 335i and S4, I suspect the only iteration of the CLA that will interest you is the CLA 45 - the AMG version with the 355HP 4-cylinder.  What I've read about that car is that it's a real rocket, perhaps a competitor for the S4.  But, isn't Audi refreshing the A3 to be a sedan only, and that a 300 HP S3 will be available down the road?"

The rest knows the engine, because it makes the noise while driving, but transmission is already a word they heard, but have no clue what it does. Front- or rear wheel drive...

Again, as most think, the looks alone will sell the car. As it gets a couple of years old, and the CLA owner's friends are all talking about how cheap their Accord is to drive and maintain, if Benz can keep them in the fold?

I suspect that most folks don't think about the cost of ownership ... they only see the low lease payment and jump in.  I find it interesting that only BMW covers maintenance for the first 4 years / 50K miles. If I were comparing at 320i against the CLA that would certainly factor into my decision.  Or, will many customers go the way of nyc, who leased his BMW but is now considering a Honda as his next car?  I'm trying to get the wife on board with a low-cost lease of a 3rd car we could share. She's got a Mazda CX-7 with almost 40K on the clock as her DD, and I've got an '06 ION with 96K that I'll keep as a winter car and part-time pizza delivery vehicle.  I'd like to find a lease in the $300-350/mo range of something that gets better mileage than the CX-7 (20-21 in mixed use) and is fun to drive. The CLA and 320i both fit the bill, I think. I looked at the Lexus CT200h last weekend; it's pretty nice inside and 40MPG is outstanding, but not sure it would provide the 'fun' I'm looking for.  The maintenance costs of the BMW over 3 years would be $0; not sure what they'd be for the CLA.

Well, that of course depends on the actual tire, there may be some cheaper ones and alignment is not mandatory, but probably well-advised. To my surprise, tire stores would not touch my 328 for alignment, so I have only a dealer or specialised indy garage. I'm glad I found one close to my workplace, their prices seem to be higher than ""standard"" brands, but much lower than my friendly dealer. When the paid maintenance period is over, I'll likely end up in their bay full time, not just for those alignments."

4885,"October  3, 2013  3:58PM",dino001,"If you want 320 without maintenance, make sure you don't get sports line. Its summer tires will go at 20-25K, other lines have all-seasons, which may last the whole lease, but they may go around 30K-35K, just before you turn it it. You may get away with skipping alignment for three years, I guess, especially if you don't need to change tires before the lease is up.

Until I get seat time in a CLA (which isn't in the foreseeable future), I really don't know how I'll view it. I only know that I was underwhelmed by the C350. I can't imagine I would miraculously like the CLA in light of those feelings. But, who knows? Maybe that AMG CLA will be right up my alley.  Fed....I do agree with you....that 3 pointed star will sell a lot of CLAs....at least in the first year or so...until those maintenance $$$ start to kick in.  I know looking at the maintenance schedule and costs looked pretty steep to me a couple of years ago when we were looking at the C350 coupe. And, those types of things rarely bother me.

4898,"September 24, 2013  7:50PM",markcincinnati,"Although I had read the R&T comparison on-line, my physical magazine arrived in the mail yesterday (Monday 9/23) -- and I re-read the Q50 v ATS v 335 v IS 350 F-Sport article. I assume you could infer that I am carrying Infiniti's water, but the article did make a comment that even the loser (or 3rd finisher) in the bunch was a ""nice car.""  For those of you who think the Q50 isn't really an upgrade of the G37 -- and assuming you haven't seen one in person, or haven't gotten behind the wheel and haven't driven it -- the Q50 has a seriously upscale (non-Nissan) interior, an exterior that advances the theme (even if you don't like it or aren't drawn to it, it does show more than just a slightly evolutionary change).  Yes the engine of the new Q50 is the same as the outgoing engine (and transmission); but, somehow the Q50 at full cry compared with the G37 under similar circumstances, sounds and feels several steps more refined, less harsh, less ""thrashy.""  All the tech stuff -- that seems to be universally dissed -- is part of a package that you need not order. Unfortunately, all the apparently loathed tech: self-driving, pseudo-psychic stuff has to be selected (and endured) to get blind spot monitoring.  A nice long test drive in a new Q50S/AWD reveals it to be a major update in luxury and performance. Your decision to consider these updates as improvements is, well, YOUR decision.  I had thought, at MSRP, the Q50 could possibly be the new winna and champeen sports sedan -- when compared to the 4-cylinder Audi A4, BMW 3 series and Cadillac ATS. I can now count at least five (5) negative articles (3 of them comparison articles) about the new Q50 in ""major"" car enthusiasts' magazines. One negative, no problem, two negatives, ""I can explain,"" but five articles that deride the lack of a solid steering column or reveal the Q50 to come in fourth (out of four) or second (out of two) and so on, are gonna require some heavy 'splainin' or some major sub-venting whilst Infiniti's designers and engineers apply numerous PTF's, service packs and point-releases in an effort to shore up the car's shortcomings and earn it the right to ask for a ""re-do"" review and comparison.  I wouldn't be shocked if an all tricked out Q50S/AWD is offered thusly: Buy one, get one free!  Well, OK, maybe that is unlikely.  Meanwhile, holy cow, Car and Driver and Road and Track BOTH proclaim an IS 350 the winna and champeen over a BMW 335! And, comparably equipped the 335 is likely to cost five-figures more than the IS. Get your IS while they're hot!  Perhaps, however, the Cadillac ATS is an even more significant ""loser"" as it keeps coming up short despite a best ever chassis.  I thought it was particularly damning that the R&T article commented that the 3.6L six in the ATS was the same engine (virtually if not quite literally) as is used to motivate the new Impala.  The American and Japanese mfgrs, Cadillac, Infiniti and Lexus, need to bring out either super or turbo charged 4's and 6's -- ASAP! Frankly, I was damn near stunned that the 335's engine couldn't seal the deal -- proclaiming the Lexus engine as the second best engine was impressive considering its age.  Test driving note:  Until last Thursday, the Audi A7 3.0T was one of the best (if not the best) cars I have ever driven. The supercharged engine coupled with that 8-speed transmission coupled with the feel of the car at high speeds coupled with the way it took corners all came together in a car that was attainable without robbing a bank.  Last Thursday, my Audi dealer called to offer me a test drive of a new 2014 S4 with the 7-speed DSG transmission. The S4 tester had the upgraded leather seats, the ""pin-stripe"" black wood trim, B&O sound system and an Audi Exclusive blue pearl paint (at a breathtaking price), to name other ""available"" options. It was just south of $59,000 (less than an A7 by far.)  Again, with the qualification that this car is ""attainable"" by mere mortals (if they are upper-middle class, that is), I would say the S4 is sublime, the best ever I have ever . . . . :surprise:  The transmission is practically telepathic or perhaps to put a finer point on it, the transmission is a mind-reader. Holy cow, please (who ever I can plead my case to) make this 7-speed DSG transmission an option on EVERYTHING you build.  As it is very easy to get a BMW 335 to the ""upper fifties"" and as the current trend seems to be to compare the 335 to the ATS, the Q50 and of course the IS, it would seem a five-way comparison wherein an S4 was included (perhaps without the high-zoot leather and big-buck paint job and the most expensive dash trim) would be a no brainer. After all, an S4 can be easily configured -- and desirable -- and still be in the lower fifties.  It wouldn't surprise me if the S4 bettered both the 335 and the IS 350.  As Cheech and Chong once said, ""I saw god, man!""  The S4 -- with the MSRP qualification -- is currently my favorite car (of any car that I and other mere mortals could afford).  We're, er, I'm not worthy.  DILYL."
4899,"September 24, 2013 11:18PM",andres3,"Your findings on the S4 are the same as mine. Which is why I ordered one lightly optioned and got the dealer to agree to take only 50K out of my bank accounts (don't worry, CA will take about 5K more before it's all said and done.  Should be arriving at my location 2nd week of November or so.  The Q50 would be better with the S4's brakes, drive train (engine & transmission) for sure!  So would the IS 350. So would the ATS. So would the 335i.  I'm picking the supercharged Audi 3.0L V6 all day and night, and all the other manufacturers really need to pay Audi to buy rights to use the 7-speed DSG in their own automatics.  In my view, once you go DSG, you never go back. The other automatics are not competitive at all in my opinion; even with 8 gears.  I hear BMW has a good dual clutch in the M-series, but that isn't in the $50K ball park."

Drop the ""pearlescent"" paint, the hi-zoot seats, and the ""whatzatstuff"" trim, and you should be able to make a case for a low $50-ish check with your dealer (but you'll probably have to go to Beechmont Audi to make that score).  S4 w/Premium Plus, B&O stereo, DSG should get you to that ballpark.  Now, if they could just make it so they can keep it out of its 2nd home in the dealer's service bay..........  I read the same rags as you. Never could understand why they don't include an S4 in those Sport/Lux comparisons. I can't see how it would lose against the usual suspects.  That 3.0 S/C motor is under rated by Audi. the BMW 3.0L dual scroll turbo is really good. The Audi 3.0 S/C is better. Torque can be found everywhere. And, the DSG is the best transmission I've ever used....on any car, at any price. Ride, handling...superb. The S4 steering should make BMW uber jealous."

If it ends up in the shop as much as Graphic Guy's '13 S4, I'll need a lemon law lawyer on standby to get me an exchange for a ""good"" one.  Had a Southern CA Audi Club driving event this last weekend, and no one was complaining about their recent model S4 and S5's. A lot of S4's and S5's by the way, a higher percentage certainly of the total cars than in years past. One TTS, one R8, and one RS5 for good measure too."

I went by the Acura dealer near my office last week and they had 11 or 12 2013 Base TL models lined up with $31,900 plastered on the windshield. They were all Bellanova White Pearl (Iridescent Beige) or Basque Red Pearl II (similar to the color of a bloodclot)!

The current A4 has more power and torque yet, and well, the S4 uses the supercharged 3.0 V6.  To each there own, the CLA just doesn't do anything for me style wise, and I'm suspicious the interior will be downgraded quite a bit.

I saw the CLA in the showroom and the interior is clearly not the same as E class and probably on par in size with the 1.8t. Which is why I am reconsidering the S4 if for the same price I gain some comfyness and giving up some points in style. I am hoping as the S3 releases, Audi will be tweaking the S4 and maybe giving incentives."

Drive an S4 with the DSG transmission; put the transmission into ""S"" and be treated to mind reading awe inspiring performance -- without the torque vectoring rear (sport) diff even.  Feel -- or perhaps better said ""sense"" -- the car downshift as you slow, smoother than anyone could shift a stick and without any pause. There aren't enough o's in smoooth to describe this, it must be, begs to be driven. A deep well of torque awaits your command with zero lag -- whoosh, it is like upgrading your iPhone 5 to the new operating system and watching your email client make the jump to light speed.  Here is my regret -- the difference between the 2.0T and the 3.0T ""A"" and ""S"" 4 is a chasm a giant, deep and wide chasm. The A4 needs to be offered with the 3.0T engine as it is offered in the Q5 3.0T. Also, for some price, the DSG transmission ought to be offered on the 2.0T, the milder 3.0T and the wilder 3.0T (as it is already there).  Were Audi to offer the 8-speed tip and the 7-speed DSG across the board (of three engines), I would look forward to win after win after win for these sport ,sedans: the A4, the AS4 and the S4. Nice as the new IS 350 F Sport is, I would expect the AS4 and with absolute certainly the S4 to be seeing the IS's LED's in its rearview mirror.  And, for the money -- in this league -- the S4 and the 335 would be competitive (with each other, at least). Of course the IS and even the ATS can certainly be considered the value leaders; yet, the Q50/S is already so highly subvented (and it is likely to remain thus until its issues are behind it) that even with its faults is an attractive alternative for those who want an upscale high content premium car.  A friend of mine used to say Audi's are for the left-brainers and BMW's are for the right-brainers -- meaning that ""programmers"" drove Audis and the Vice-president of Sales drove BMWs. I think now the Q50 has become the ""programmers"" [geek squad] car and, well, these days ""everyone wants to be Audi.""

I agree. For that money, you can get an S5.  I also looked at a C300 before I bought the 335i. Once again, I could never see the MB being able to match, let alone exceed, the drive of the BMW for the same money.  CLA is a lesser version of all those cars, even in AMG guise.  Personally, I'd test drive the S4. As others have said, that's what will hook you. I'd also look at the IS350, for no other reason than all the positive press it has received, just to see if it fits what you're looking for."
4914,"September 27, 2013  4:13PM",markcincinnati,"The CLA has been the cause of a decent amount of journalistic drool for months and months and months. The tarted up version has caused some who write about cars and get paid for doing so to be unabashedly aroused, in fact.  Check out the comments about the upcoming A3 -- I don't have them right in front of me, but the gist is something like ""the new A3 is everything we all wanted the CLA to be -- and there is an S3 version coming shortly after the A3 quattro hits showrooms next year.""  Can't believe I'm saying this: IMHO, BMW -- a brand that I love AND think is breathtakingly expensive -- looks like a bargain compared to any Mercedes I can think of. Would love to see an S4 reviewed side by side with a comparably PRICED Mercedes.  The S4 would be high contented compared to the Merc and the S4 would make the worthy opposition sweat.  Me? Again, I am looking for content and performance and bang for the buck. Hate to say it, but the IS 350 F-Sport makes a compelling case (when compared to even the god-like S4).  You know, all the criticism about Infiniti and Lexus bringing out new cars with ""old"" engines does have merit. But, even so, the IS 350 seems to win the pros over in spite of its ""old"" engine. I get sweaty palms just imagining what would happen if Lexus told its engineers to make the requisite changes to the 350's powerplant to allow it to accept either a super or turbo charger. :surprise:  ""Happy motoring and back to the freeway which is already in progress.""

4942,"September 23, 2013  3:10PM",Kirstie_H,"We aren't making any ""tweaks"" to the forum because we'll be migrating to a new forums software platform in the near future, and our efforts are focused on making that a smooth transition, and also getting everything we could want from a software platform taken care of before we move.  We won't have the 6-vehicle limit there, and the software also has much more ""search-friendly"" features. Unless something is critically broken on this platform, it's not going to get attention for the time being.  While the main site is being redesigned, our forums move is totally separate from that - the timing is just coincidental. We just couldn't live with all of the bugs, outages and slowness (not to mention the lack of basic features like private messaging and easy image upload), and we got the go-ahead from Edmunds to find a new vendor."

We'll be doing a lot more testing prior to launch to do our best to make it a smooth transition.  I'm sure some people won't like it, but unfortunately staying with this platform is out of the question. We've had an extreme lack of support from our current provider, which is why sometimes technical issue fixes take way longer than they should."

I'd say the review is stronger about the previous iteration (the G37) than the new one -- too much tech, too expensive, too too.  Back to the A4, 3 and the new IS F Sport if you asked me (but I would still argue in favor of test drive rather than being put off by C/D's take alone.  Drive it like you live. :surprise:"

I think a proper comparo test done by more then one mag- with all current contenders pulls more weight then the 15 min test drive you had with a salesmen sitting shot gun. Not saying the information and experience was not of any value, but just less then a James Healey or consumer reports- and another few ticks lower then c&d and others.

The few I've read and watch are actually glowing, you mentioned the c&d one which I guess was about the hybrid. For those of us looking at a SUb 50 sports sedan would not consider a hybrid. Sure tesla has done it right; but what other hybrid is a real all around Lux sport sedan and at a price point of 50k, which I think is redik .  On the g and a test drive, look I would love to drive the new one but I honestly can't think of replacing my car as its an 07x that has 36k miles on it- all driven by me. Just got an oil change and swaped the battery- the low maintence $$ is huge, my usage tax which was 1500 when I bought it is under 150- and most of all it's still a car that can hold its own with cars from today. The q for me would be on a very short list, always liked the lex and the 335- but I can't see being a guy who goes to dealerships and not truly looking to buy a car- not me - better ways of using my time - like driving fast and taking chances"

The 305 horses were being lazy, or the 8 speed auto was slushing the power drastically.  Either that, or I got a ""lemon"" 350 F Sport for my test drive.

4958,"September 12, 2013  3:41PM",markcincinnati,"I drove the Q50S AWD recently. Loved it. The article from C&D, while disappointing, wouldn't change my mind. I was and continue to lament the apparent lack of marketing savvy Infiniti has demonstrated regarding the Q50 -- but I will wait (for another year) to see how Infiniti does under the watchful and experienced eye and hand of Johan (as we know -- 19+ years at the helm of Audi of America, who does a great job, typically of marketing across traditional and non-traditional media).  Because my wife and I have (thus far) kept to 3-year leases (and we drive over 18K miles per year), it seems -- almost literally -- that one or the other of us is always shopping for a replacement car as one or the other is coming off lease. Hence, we do tend to test drive, as noted at least 10 times per year. I completely understand if you are NOT in the market, not wanting to test drive. Conversely, as an ""enthusiast"" I would understand if someone test drove -- on the pro-am circuit -- 24 times per year even if they weren't in the market or in the mood, so to speak.  Posting here (and on Audiworld, for instance) gets our (my) interest up, so I am in the camp that favors staying ""on the hunt."" Potato, Potaato, kind of a thing.  Last night, got to drive a loaded IS 350 F Sport.  First impression (for the price) - better than the Q50S. First impression (price be damned) - still better than the Q50S  Felt tighter, more connected -- heck, it felt like a go-kart it was so connected to the road. Turn-in was sharper than a Ken Onion Shun chef's knife -- I am sure I could get used to it, but in Sport+ mode the thing DARTED with only small steering wheel inputs.  Felt ""as if"" it were electric, the power was so quick and smooth. I only got it to about 65 MPH.  Great sound system, fantastic seats (almost Audi good, in fact.)  Not so sure why the pros say the dash is the first premium offering from any manufacturer to better an Audi interior. Interior was nice, but seemed like looking at a staircase instead of a flowing piece cut from a single piece.  I'd put it on the list -- cause at $49K (including shipping), this seems to be a better bang for the buck than either the A4 Sline or the Q50S.  I've asked for a second, long, test drive -- we'll see if it holds up to further inspection.  Drive it like you live.  :surprise:"
4959,"September 12, 2013  4:12PM",sweendogy,"""24 times per year even if they weren't in the market or in the mood, so to speak""  Who has that kind of time- even if you were in the market -24 times - that's crazy. Dealers must love you - yeah love the car- have to wait a year still have 23 more test drives to make sure this is the one. You and flight should car pool to these dealerships."
4960,"September 12, 2013  6:19PM",kyfdx,"Mark..  Being in Cincinnati, I'm sure that the Q50 was AWD, right? How about the IS350? RWD or AWD?"
4961,"September 12, 2013  6:27PM",markcincinnati,"We test about 10 cars per year, escalating, sometimes to 12 or 13 -- I never said we test drive 24 times annually (although we have friends who are well heeled who seem to get a new car every spring whether they need one or not -- meaning they test a LOT.)  Dealers -- from our experience with premium brands, that is -- do seem to ""love"" having their cars test driven. The Chrysler/Jeep dealer (on the other hand) asks ""if you're going to buy today"" and if you don't give the answer they obviously want, well, ""see ya!""  Friend of ours used to work at Circuit City (remember them?) and he told me that he had two-minutes to spend with a customer and if there wasn't a clear indication that the person was going to buy TODAY, their mantra was ""who's next?"" Seems like the domestic auto dealers (Cadillac excluded) all have this ""2 minute mindset"" too.  My wife ordered her new Audi (delivery estimated at ~75-90 days) last week from a salesrep that has seen her smiling face numerous times over the last year (and we've test driven everything but an R8 and an A8) -- talk about the patience of Job. But, in the end she chose the $51K Audi over similarly priced BMWs, Volvos, Infinitis and Mercedes.  One point is (or could be) -- ""no one buys a car without driving it"" (according to the rep), so the more ""drives"" the reps have going on, the more likely it is they'll have sales; it is a numbers game, even for Premium Autos or perhaps especially for the premium autos, apparently.  Another point is (and often is) -- folks, Baby Boomers especially (not so much Millenials) like or love cars, like or love talking about them, blogging about them and driving them; so for some (especially like my wife) test driving serves a secondary purpose -- it's entertaining!  The only time I wasn't entertained was when we took out a new Lincoln -- couldn't get back to the dealership fast enough.  Drive it . . . you know . . ."
4962,"September 12, 2013  6:56PM",markcincinnati,"Hell, the Infiniti dealer told me they have zero, zip, nada plans to even STOCK RWD Q50's -- dealer trade or special order only for the RWD versions; so, yep, we test drove a Q50S/AWD with every option except the TECH Package (the package with the blind spot monitoring system). The AWD factoid should come as no shock especially since the 10th largest BMW store's sales manager told me ""well over 50%"" of the cars they sell are X-drive  Regarding BSM, it seems like so many brands offer Blind Spot Monitoring systems as a stand alone option (usually around $500-$600) -- Infiniti bundles it an a $3,000+ package of electronic nannies. Much as I like the Q50S AWD, I wouldn't get any new car without Blind Spot Monitoring, and I don't want my new car -- yet, if ever -- to be able to drive itself and fight me whenever I try.  So, the Q50S AWD is [probably] off the table -- but I can be bought.  The Lexus IS offers BSM for relatively cheap (like Audi and Volvo, to name two) -- so score another point for the IS (but the Audi offers it stand alone too, don't you know).  The IS 350 F Sport I drove was RWD -- the only one in Cincinnati (the only F Sport so they claim). I have already signed up to test the first AWD version of an IS 350 F Sport once they come in. I didn't even bother to get into a regular IS 350 AWD -- although IS's overall seem plentiful (it's just the F Sports that are in short supply -- which was blamed on the dealer's procurement mgr; he/they didn't think Lexus customers would clamor for the SPORT version of anything -- being that it is Lexus -- ""a sofa on wheels"" -- after all).  There's a new sheriff in town -- and his/her badge has a stylized ""L"" on it (look out BMW).  Drive it like you live."

4964,"September 12, 2013  7:18PM",andres3,"I found the IS 350 RWD F-Sport I drove to be a bit more cramped inside than an A4/S4. Both less leg room, less width, and a lower roof line. Roof line matters to me a lot, I'm 6'3"" tall, and I'm not skinny anymore.  Granted, it was close, but it seemed the S4 was just a notch roomier in every way.  I didn't notice much if any difference when switching between Sport, Sport + and comfort/regular. I did notice a bigger difference in a pre-owned 2011 S4 when I was playing with comfort vs. dynamic.  I have to admit I preferred the steering weight and feeling in the '11 S4 and '09 335i I test drove over the '13 S4, which still felt better and more weighted than all others. I guess in recent years everyone has gone with electric steering for efficiency. It didn't change the mileage rating on the S4 so it must be .4 miles or less better per gallon."

Funny you mention that, was at the BMW dealer Wed night, drove a 320i, since BMW is giving 2,500K credit, towards purchasing a 2013 3 series. People criticize the 320i, but as a occasional driver it's not a bad car, Premium package, Sport package is $39,950, costco auto program $36,750 so far give price of $35,900 plus tax and lic. This does not include the $2500. I'm going with the BMW Select Financing, don't know if I'm going with the 48 or 60 month. I was told BMW has a special rate with the 48 months, but the sale manager has to get back with me.  While at the dealership, they have two 3 series GT's, have to say, lots of room in it much more so then what I figured, they also have 4 328d's, didn't drive one, I might tomorrow just to see what it drives like.  Sweeny, it's nice to sit at home and read car magazines and bench talk about cars, however, getting out and test driving them is a whole different story, as Mark stated, the Germans want to go for a test drive, what i found is, they want a stat a relationship with the client, something that the domestic dealers lack and asians. Once you are in the fiance office it's NEXT. The guy I deal with at BMW knows me, he knows I'll buy again, and I am.

4967,"September 13, 2013  3:13PM",markcincinnati,"I can't remember if the ""cause"" is local or if all BMW dealers do what is done at one of the dealerships here in River City: About once a year (it could be more) I get an invitation in the mail, followed up with a voice mail message inviting my wife and me to test drive as many BMW's as we want (all in a single day).  As I recall, the dealership has a huge grill that they keep fired up cooking brats, metts and hamburgers. They have veggies, cookies, sodas, bottled water and (in the dealership) a Starbucks - lite. All the food and other things offered (a goodies bag) are no-charge.  What they are doing, I assume, is pimping their cars in the most subtle way possible. They tell you that for every car you drive and every mile you drive it, they will make a donation to the [breast] Cancer society (something like that.) And, after you have taken so many cars out you get a little sticker or pin that proclaims you helped raise money for the cure.  Naturally when there is free food and drink and cool cars to drive, the place is packed. My wife and I drove an X6 (she had an X3 at the time) and she loved it (conceptually). Now she didn't buy one, but of all the cars we drove that day, the ruby red metallic X6 was the subject of a number of subsequent conversations.  Altruism? I'll go so far as to say ""possibly"" since there was money raised for a good cause. Yet, the buzz generated by this ""forced"" test driving has to be worth a lot of TV ads and other marketing expenses -- don't you think?  And, we actually got to drive some pretty cool cars (there was no M5 in inventory, however), eat some good burgers, mingle with a bunch of other BMW (or perhaps just premium car) geeks and raise money for a good cause. Seems like a great idea -- get folks to drive ""everything"" pump them up, ""don't forget to breathe"" signs were hung everywhere -- it was a blast.  The point is, if you like these premium cars and you blog about them, belong to and participate in forums about them -- you might just be like the characters on ""The Big Bang"" who are always playing D&D, shopping for comic books and buying memorabilia -- even though they are PhD's working for a prestigious university.  I would guess many of us here posting are closet (or maybe we have come out of said closet) car geeks -- we drink our coffee out of fill-in-the-blank logo'd coffee cups (in my case Audi, in my wife's case BMW), we have ""expensive"" logo'd polo shirts, jackets and key fobs proclaiming our affinity for our favorite brand (lots of BMW jackets here in Cincinnapolis, for example) and so forth.  To this day, Audi sends me expensive brochures and from time to time a hardcopy book (25 years of quattro, kind of thing); but, to be fair, so does Lincoln, even though we only took a short test drive of one of them and couldn't get out of it fast enough the test drive was so bad.  Ahhh, its the weekend -- and we're on the hunt for a replacement for my 2012 Acura TL SH-AWD. My wife says we're testing a new ATS (already tested the CTS -- not the 2014 -- and found it wanting) and a new A4 or S4 or both. I recently drove an A6 with the 220HP four cylinder, and I thought it was pretty sweet, maybe we'll do that too -- with the sport suspension if possible.  What a great time to be in the market.

Many fundraising events like the 3 Day have minimum commitments for fundraising. Here in MA, there is a biking event called the Pan Mass Challenge which raises money for the Jimmy Fund at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. It's a two day 110 mile ride and one must raise or commit to paying $4300 to participate - it goes to $5000 if you register late (there are shorter rides with lower fund raising commitments). They were the first charity event to have participants give them a credit card at registration. The founder isn't shy about it - trying to raise the amount isn't good enough.  Yet they get 5000 people regularly and have a goal of $38 million this year.  Part of having a minimum amount is to make sure participants are committed. It's a logistical nightmare to coordinate support for 5000 people over 110 miles. If people sign up and then drop out, they have too many resources. If too many people raise too little money, then the event might not make money."

I drove it (the Q), and yes I liked the IS more, but for a $120/month differential for 36 months with no money down, the Q50 could prove to be a good seller, good value, and selling well enough to allow the '15 or '16 to work out some of the complaints presented by the pros and amateurs (like us).

The engine is the 3.6; DOHC 306hp, w/ 6spd auto. The engine revved and wanted to go high but of course the fuel cut off kicked in, the 6 spd auto shifted well, good up shift with no hesitation and downshifts were smooth. I was impressed with the car, no rattles, the car almost rode like a German car, but not as refined as one. I have driven two of them one a top of the line 2LTZ and a 2LT. Behind the radio is a ""hidden"" compartment that has a USB port so one could load a iPod or ITouch and leave it there connect and not have to worry about it. The cars had 5 USB ports in it, this is the first car I have had with this many. Ford really needs to do something with their Taurus if they want to be competitive in this segment.  So I liked the car, it is now one of the cars I look for when renting. BTW, so far I have averaged 26 MPG with the cars. I'm sure once they bring the 8 spd/auto into the MPG will go up. I have pictures of the interior but I don't know to upload them."

4985,"September  6, 2013 11:04PM",m6user,Tks. My wife will be looking for a replacement sedan in the next 6-12 months and the Impala is a possibility. I've only seen a couple on the road and I hear they are in short supply at dealers so the fact that you can get them readily at the rental counter is unusual. Guess they wanted to get them out to be experienced by many and the people that tend to rent full size autos are probably their target audience on the most part. How did it compare with the your partner's Genesis?

4987,"September  8, 2013  3:56PM",markcincinnati,"Johan de Nysschen has his work cut out for him. The new head honcho of Infiniti &#150; formerly of Audi (of America) for almost 20 years &#150; has to do for Infiniti what he did for Audi. He must take a run at making you think of BMW (or Audi) as the German Infiniti. Tall task? Well, based on the lethargic launch of the Q50, I don&#146;t envy Johan.  You may or may not lend much credence to Automobile, Car and Driver, Motor Trend, Popular Mechanics or Road and Track&#146;s gravitas in promoting [automotive] brands. If you discount these magazines&#146; influence, fine &#150; I would imagine, however, you are at least aware of them (especially if you are participating in this and other car-centric forums).  The point I will hopefully make is highly derivative; indeed, without apology, the influence for my conclusions has been shaped by John Naisbitt&#146;s 1982 book, Megatrends. Perhaps I should clarify and sharpen my focus: My point &#150; to be revealed shortly &#150; is based on using a technique of observation and counting how much &#147;ink&#148; is spread pertaining to a particular subject, story or brand or product. Moreover, once the quantity of ink has been identified, it is also of importance to identify and rank the content (or the &#147;qualities&#148;) of the ink.  We&#146;ve all been hearing and reading about the new Q50 for what seems to be a long time (in automotive product life-cycles). We&#146;ve seen full-page ads in the major automotive enthusiasts&#146; magazines for at least a couple of months. What we haven&#146;t seen are test reports, comparison tests and &#147;First Drives&#148; &#150; yet we&#146;re seeing ink (for several months now) about cars that aren&#146;t even available for purchase, e.g., the upcoming Mercedes-Benz CLA45 to name just one.  Audi and BMW, too, seem to be masters at garnering great quantities of ink about cars that are either still on the drawing boards or aren&#146;t yet in production form, e.g., the BMW M4. Audi, BMW, Cadillac, Lexus and even KIA (!) are very adept at keeping the volume of the buzz about their brands and products cranked up to 11.  I just got the new Automobile magazine yesterday (October 2013 issue) &#150; the New Cars for 2014 issue. Page 38 - 40, &#147;Driven: BMW 435i&#148; offers up less than a review but more than a rehash of the corporate brochure &#150; the car is discussed, albeit briefly, in terms of performance, style, ride and handling. The spread includes pictures of the car&#146;s anterior and posterior as well as its engine and interior (in red leather). This marks at least 2 mentions (ink) of the &#147;4 series&#148; in this issue.  Further evidence of the virtual lack of any buzz regarding new Q50 is the &#147;Sport-Sedan Slugfest&#148; in the June &#146;13 Car and Driver &#150; where the BMW 3, the Cadillac ATS and the Lexus IS duke it out for king of the hill bragging rights. I would have thought Infiniti would have busted its hump to get the Q50S included in the slugfest. I would argue that the Infiniti, not the Lexus would have been the odds-on favorite choice for this comparision article based on the G37 being dubbed (more than once) the Japanese BMW. The highly anticipated (and touted) Q50 being excluded from this comparison is an incredible marketing blunder &#150; especially since Infiniti has been showing off the Q50 for several months now at invitation only dealer events where Infiniti representatives regale the invitees with anecdotes wherein the Q50S betters Audi A4&#146;s and BMW 3&#146;s on the track.  I was, understandably I think, eager with anticipation when I turned to page 56 of the new Automobile magazine to see the mini article, &#147;Driven: Infiniti Q50.&#148; Unfortunately, there is little ink devoted to a discussion of how the car performs. Indeed, what struck me was the following: &#147;. . . the Q50 is not so much an all-new sport sedan as a refreshed and rebodied Infiniti G37.&#148; Most of the remaining ink pertained to the Q50&#146;s ability to [almost] drive itself.  Even an admitted gadget-geek (like me) would likely be underwhelmed by the content of this &#147;ink.&#148; Practically speaking the buzz potentially created by this ink is arguably not the kind of buzz Infiniti probably was hoping for &#150; and it is certainly not the kind of buzz that is likely to retain the brand&#146;s (or the Q50 itself) image as &#147;the Japanese BMW.&#148;  Although I have driven a new very high-contented AWD Q50S and can absolutely attest to its worthiness as an A4 or 3 series (and therefore IS and ATS) rival, this conclusion has been reached in spite of Infiniti&#146;s dismal marketing efforts. I seriously doubt the majority of the market the Q50 seems to be courting will notice the Q50 until (or unless) the ink spread around about it focusses more on the performance, luxury and driving dynamics rather than its expensive technology package that seems hell bent on distancing the driver from, er, driving.  My wife &#150; currently driving a 2011 Infiniti FX35 AWD Premium &#150; sums it up this way, &#147;Infiniti&#146;s do everything well &#150; but they don&#146;t seem to want to involve their customers as drivers. The Germans, especially Audi and BMW somehow imbue their cars, their dealerships, their owner clubs and web sites with customers who are passionate about the brand. Indeed, the thing lacking from Infiniti is a soul or a passion to both drive and be driven.&#148;  Perhaps that it why even a &#147;pull ahead&#148; deal Infiniti offered her couldn&#146;t compel her to be a two-time Infiniti owner. She went to Audi, BMW and Volvo and drove a like-priced ($50K) Q5, X3 and XC60 and ended up ordering a &#147;passion inducing&#148; supercharged 2014 Audi Q5. Pity, the Infiniti brand (and most of the products individually) can&#146;t seem to catch a break.  The &#147;Megatrends&#148; methodology seems to indicate BMW is unlikely to be known as the German Infiniti any time soon.  Drive it like you live. :confuse:"
4988,"September  9, 2013  1:57AM",dino001,"I just read an article about sales of 3-series going gangbusters. Basically another piece of evidence that enthusiasts don't matter, at least in short run. People are lining up to buy this ""sports sedan"" probably for reasons why the same people didn't buy them before - it's big, comfy, easy to drive. But it's a BMW, so it must be sporty, right? Since they've never sit in a true sporty car, if they had, they thought it was uncomfortable crap, how would they know the difference, anyway. Looks to me BMW cashed the chips and they bought huge sale boost. It will be interesting to see long term effects of this. VW made a similar gambit with Jetta and Passat by decontenting them, stripping all those good suspension components and making barges out of them. It worked until it stopped. After couple of years of initial huge boost they hit a wall and sales stalled, even fell at some point. I wonder if same could happen to BMW. Maybe not, who knows. One thing is certain, my not liking (hating actually) the new 3 steering doesn't matter."
4989,"September  9, 2013  2:49AM",stickguy,"well, maybe it is no longer ""sporty"" to old school BMW types, but for anyone coming out of mainstream cars (Camry say) or a Lexus it is certainly a major step up the sports sedan spectrum."
4990,"September  9, 2013  3:36AM",dino001,"Exactly, it is all relative. All they have to do is convince enough people it's better than the alternative. The funny thing is their competitors are moving toward that point from the other side, making it very crowded market with small differences. I guess that's inevitable in world of mass production, one has to cater to least objectionable rather than try to stand out. It's the price for going from niche to global."
4991,"September  9, 2013  1:10PM",graphicguy,"dino...stickguy....I think you both hit the nail on the head with the 3 series. BMW did cash in their chips on the new one. But, they've been moving away from sports sedan into more mainstream waters for a while now.  I think the thing that BMW has that VW did not, at least in this country, is the cachet of their brand. VW lost their ""cool"" factor a long time ago.  Now, does BMW retain the cool factor after moving their cars into more mundane territory? Remains to be seen and we probably won't know for another decade or so.  markincincinnati.....I think what kills the Q50 is that drivetrain. It's getting long in the tooth. And the NVH factor has never been its strong suit. It might be OK in an Altima or a Maxima. But, in a $50K lux sedan? Not so much!  I'm thinking you did the test drive up at Kings Automall? Those guys used to send me stuff all the time. But, sounds like they had something of a management shakeup as the previous GM who had been there for years, is no longer there. One of the sales people (whose name I did not recognize) must have dug up my email info from their files. I got an email from him towards the end of last month touting their HUGE selection of Q50s and their willingness to ""deal"" on them.  No sure what that means with a car that just hit the streets."

4993,"September  9, 2013  3:55PM",dino001,"Of course. ""Sells like hot cakes"", ""We can't get enough of those"", , ""The supply is very tight"" ""Everybody is asking about this color/trim (of course it happens to be one you want). All to make you believe you need to pay up to get one. This is especially true with ""all new"" models that just arrived. The supply shortages may even be real, whether they are due to demand, or ramping production, a well-trained salesman will always spin it into ""c'mon buddy, you're paying the sticker today"".  If the car is new and they already say ""we have huge inventory waiting just for you"", things are really slow."
4994,"September  9, 2013  4:01PM",Michaell,Couldn't you use the dealer's website to see how many of a particular model are available?  Then you would be armed with better information as to whether a model is 'hot' or not.
4995,"September  9, 2013  4:20PM",m6user,"I didn't mean specifically, just in general they always use some kind of come on like that. In the Q50's case, I don't think they are desperate yet as it just hit the dealerships a few weeks ago and from my few drivebys of the the local Infiniti dealer it didn't look like they had that many Q50s in stock. I think you are reading way too much into into an email from a car salesman."
4996,"September  9, 2013  4:44PM",dino001,"You may be correct. It may be as simple as a relative ""we have large choice and the guy across town does not"". It was Mark that planted the thought in me that Q50 may not be selling. It certainly is too early to tell."
4997,"September  9, 2013  5:05PM",Kirstie_H,"Depends. Some services that the dealerships use list ALL inventory available at that dealership as well as nearby dealerships. I've seen dealership personnel complain about this before, as it gives consumers the impression that the vehicle they like is available on the lot of the dealership whose website they're viewing."
4998,"September  9, 2013  5:48PM",carnaught,"To Mark or anyone who's driven the Q50: Does the Q50 drive essentially the same as the G37 it replaced? It has an improved interior and more tech., but has the same (aging and ubiquitous Nissan) engine. Does it still exhibit the same characteristics, such as the overly intrusive boy-racer exhaust note, for example? (Some like it, some do not.)"
4999,"September  9, 2013  8:21PM",markcincinnati,"I drove a fully loaded Q50S AWD. I drove into the dealership in a 2011 FX35 -- I have test driven the M37X's and several other Infinitis within the past 4 months.  The thrash of an Infiniti V6 certainly isn't banished from the new Q50, but it is way way muted in the new evolution of the G sedan. I wouldn't mind having the sound of the Q50 at full-cry enter into the cabin of a Q50 I was driving, it has been so tamed.  I'm not making excuses -- or at least that is not my intent -- I dare say so few people have ever even test driven one of the new Q50's, the product is hardly an issue.  The car's anonymity is what I was remarking upon (in my ""ink"" post) -- due to what I would call damn near a marketing implosion. The Q50 should have had an Audi or a BMW-like launch -- a launch designed to tease, announce, build buzz, showcase and provide plenty of first drives, ""drivens"" and side-by-side comparos. Instead the new Q50 has been brought to market with about as much buzz as there would be for a closeout sale of 2008 full-sized pickup trucks that have been on the lot since, well, 2007.  I don't mean to be carrying Infiniti's water even though I can tell you the Q50S AWD drives like it belongs in a comparison with a new BMW 3, Cadillac ATS, Audi A4 (or even S4) or Lexus IS 350 F Sport.  If you think the Q50 will provide a disappointing aural experience -- especially at full throttle -- you will be proven wrong (happily, I would hope.)  The Q50 does raise the bar in the ""sport sedan"" class (for 15 minutes)-- but, you're right, the engine does need to be re-thought and redesigned. I'd say the transmission can ""keep on"" perhaps for another year or two before it MUST be replaced.  In contrast, the IS 350, which also came to market with an ""old"" engine, has an even more transformed package to distinguish itself from the outgoing IS. And the IS has had a ""crack team"" of marketers getting it in front of the target market. It has been in no less than two comparos already this year -- and its ""handlers"" seem hell-bent on getting the word out on the F Sport version as if to say, ""this is not your grandfather's Lexus.""  I have no reason to want to waste your time, so with that in mind, please take a test drive of a new Q50S AWD and post your impressions.  The Q50S does indeed seem to be Infiniti's best sedan ever!"
5000,"September  9, 2013  9:23PM",m6user,"Maybe the reason the Q50 wasn't included in some of the comparos or extensive test drives was because of availability and the fact that the drive train didn't change that much if at all. There's a review of the Q50 over on Left Lane News that is pretty positive in regards to the ""roar"" being a little tamer maybe due to sound proofing more than anything. The quality of the interior pieces and the tech impressed them quite a bit. But in that comparo you referenced, they could have at least thrown in a G37x just for comparison purposes but maybe they figured they have done that show before."

5002,"September 10, 2013  6:01AM",andres3,"prob because its a performance car and the 2 extra lbs would slow it down.  ________  hAHAHAHAH, i DON'T THINK that's the reason. I think it comes down to Audi liking to make all its profit from options. They figure people that just have to have a fully loaded model with all the bells and whistles won't mind that it could nearly double the price of the car. Okay, so that's an exaggeration, but the options can kill you. Its easy for someone to pay S4 prices on an A4, for example."
5003,"September 10, 2013  6:09AM",andres3,"Agree with your assessment 100%.  When I went to the Infiniti dealer, he asked if I was interested in the new Q50 vs. the old G37(S). I was about to answer G37, but instead, said, well..... what's new with the Q50, what's different?  He went on for about 2 minutes spewing information on a bunch of gadgets that add zero fun factor to the car. They were all about driving automation features for drivers that can't drive themselves.

In short, they list every car/model the manufacturer makes and give the impression they're in stock.  My Audi dealer does that.  In the case of the dealer I'm assuming markincincinnati is talking about, I'm familiar with them. Matter of fact, I went past their store last night (which is being remodelled).

5007,"September 10, 2013  6:51PM",markcincinnati,"Puffinalong -- no disrespect taken. And, I can't believe I am somehow seeming (even to myself) to be defending or at least suggesting the G37x, er Q50S(x) deserves to be compared with the Audi and the BMW.  My wife's and my automotive history is overwhelmingly (~93+%) German, overwhelmingly Audi, but also can count 3 BMW's (all awd variants) and 3 VW's (2 Passats and 1 Jetta) among one Infiniti (2011 FX35 Premium AWD) and one Acura (2012 TL Advance SH-AWD). I have been to 5 driving schools, 4 with Audi in Austria and 1 with BMW here in Spartenburg. My wife ""forces"" (not too tough to do) us to test drive no less than 10 automobiles per year, except in the last year of her lease (such as 2013) where she ups the test-drive count by at least 3.  I am (or, better said, we are) capable of providing ""informed"" data points here on Edmunds -- hardly professional, but more than simply casual. We are probably anal in our test driving methodology -- always going over the same routes, same speeds, entering corners at the same speeds and even taking along the same MP3 and/or CD's with us to check out our tester's audio capabilities.  We attempt to drive the SPORT designated models (and always the AWD models) of everything we test drive. We subscribe, at any one time, to no less than four auto enthusiasts magazines (plus Consumer Reports in case we need a new vacuum cleaner) and read and/or watch as many websites and youtube tests as our non-working, waking hours allow. We don't have kids, so we have a lot of time to study up on current automotive fact (and fiction.)  Repeatedly, the ""G"" Infiniti cars have been dubbed ""the Japanese BMW"" -- never once, that I can find, has either Audi or BMW been dubbed ""the German Infiniti"" -- which is partially due to marketing and partially due to the product itself.  Infiniti's sport-sedan creds are not legion-- but they are also not ancient history, either. A nicely equipped G37X/S over the past two or three model years has never been an undesirable vehicle and in some instances it wins categories or comes in as a top two or top three finisher in automobile magazines' comparos (that is automobile with a lower-case ""a"").  Further accolades regarding the Infiniti G can be found by kliking here:  ~ http://www.infinitiusa.com/g_sedan/awards-reviews.html  Once again, although I have been impressed with the new Q50S/AWD with the optional steering upgrade, I have not decided to be a two-time Japanese (let alone Infiniti) buyer.  As a member of the Audi Club of NA, I have at least the motivation of a minimum 6% off list discount ""coupon"" to make me revisit the A4 (or possibly A6 with sport package, of course); and Acura is already pushing and prodding me to ""pull ahead"" with an new (2013) TL (but since I have a 2012, it makes me wonder, ""why bother?"") Volvo's S60 T6 type - R is also interesting as is the IS 350 F Sport Lexus and even the new -- albeit routinely bashed -- 3 series. I've even looked at a Chrysler 300S and a Taurus SHO just in case. Part of me will at least mostly seriously give a critical look-see at the Cadillac ATS (and CTS) and the AWD Buick Regal GS.  So, I am not, per se an Infiniti lover nor apologist, nor am I yet willing to reject the Q50 out of hand solely on the merits of a really lackluster marketing campaign.  I remain willing to say the new Q50SX is the best Infiniti ever (that I have driven) and absolutely worth being compared to the Audi A4 and the BMW 3 -- and, if you, like Infinti, compare these three vehicles at ""the exact same price point,"" the Infiniti will win on content even if much of that content, as I noted earlier, seems to be hell bent on removing the driver from driving. . . .  Speaking of that: Drive it like you live."
5008,"September 11, 2013  2:07AM",sweendogy,"While I love the comments and reviews I wonder what could actually be gained interms of a true review from a simple test drive that lasted 15mins in a controlled environment.

The quotes Japanese bmw, The long post on the Audi discount I don't get- (audi club discount, really?) seems a bit drawn out and forced to prove some point which is never really given, is it a good or is it a tech driven value? Or at the price point, like the g it really is 90% of Bmw driving and 110% Better in tech? I'm going to reserve my own thoughts on the q (ugly name) once I've driven it and once the experts have compared it to its true comp. I would also note for real value seekers, if indeed there is a surplus of q50s on the lot and they are indeed good cars one could take advantage of such a mistake that someone else posted as infinitis fault at launch in lack of proper advertising.  Drive fast, take chances"
5009,"September 11, 2013  4:09AM",markcincinnati,"I urge you to take a test drive of the Q50S AWD -- which is pretty easy to do since there appears to be NO RWD samples available (at least here in my part of the country).  I encourage anyone who is serious about spending any money on any of the cars discussed in this forum to reserve judgement until post test drive. My response, perhaps too broad, was intended to encourage Puffinalong (and anyone really) to test drive a car before assuming it wasn't worthy of being spoken of in the same breath as Audi and BMW.  Infiniti spokespersons seem to want ""us"" to test drive the new Q50 against such competition as the A4 and 3 series at a price point. And, they do have a point -- at a nominal $50K, the Q50 will present itself with significantly higher content than an A4 or 3 series.  According to Infiniti's product advocates, an Infiniti Q50S (at the same price point) will best an A4 or a 3 series. This may or may not translate to the new Q50 bettering an A4, IS or 3 series in an enthusiasts magazine comparo (Car & Driver for example). Yet the Infiniti marketing execs and product specialists who travel the country on behalf of the brand are able to spout why the Q50 will outgun the A4 and 3 and IS and ATS given a monetary equalizer.  I doubt Car & Driver will limit its test subjects MSRPs to make sure their reviews are ""a fair fight.""  Given no limit (in this context) to price, I would assume that an Audi S4 or S5 or BMW M3 or M4 (not yet available) would be selected by a significant majority of folks -- assuming they didn't have to make the payments.  Given no slack (regarding price), however, I assume most of us will go for the maximum they can get ""for the money.""  Based on the new Car & Driver, I'd be quite willing to take a new RS7 Audi -- for $50K (dream on) were such car actually put on sale at that price.  And, yes, if you are a member of the Audi Club of NA, you do get a certificate good for 6% off list should you want to go that route (or course if you can negotiate anything better than 6%, you should take it!)  Drive it like you live!"
